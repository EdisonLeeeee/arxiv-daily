Temporal logic-based\nlearning algorithms have been proposed recently as classifiers of such data.\nHowever, current frameworks are either inaccurate for real-world applications,\nsuch as autonomous driving, or they generate long and complicated formulae that\nlack interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel\nlearning method, called Boosted Concise Decision Trees (BCDTs), to generate\nbinary classifiers that are represented as Signal Temporal Logic (STL)\nformulae.

We then analyze the network properties in conjunction\nwith the word scores by comparing with null models to separate the effects of\nthe network structure and the score distribution. Neutral words are found to be\ndominant and most words, regardless of polarity, tend to co-occur with neutral\nwords.

Where previous work analyzing such estimators focused on\nthe bias, we also examine the variance and mean squared error (MSE). In both\nsynthetic and realistic scenarios, we evaluate three estimators and find the\nunbiased estimator has the highest variance, and the estimator with the\nsmallest variance has the largest bias; the estimator with the smallest MSE\nstrikes a balance between bias and variance, displaying a classic bias-variance\ntradeoff.

Based on the\nfast and slow subsystems, a distributed state estimation scheme is proposed to\nhandle the implicit time-scale multiplicity. In the proposed design, an\nextended Kalman filter (EKF) is designed for the fast subsystem and a moving\nhorizon estimator (MHE) is designed for the slow subsystem. There is a\ncommunication between the estimators: the slow subsystem is only required to\nsend information to the fast subsystem one-directionally. The fast subsystem\nestimator does not send out any information. The estimators use different\nsampling of the state measurements, i.e., fast sampling of the fast state\nvariables is considered in the fast EKF and slow sampling of the slow state\nvariables is considered in the slow MHE.

We evaluate each\nscheduling policy by its approximation ratio, which we define to be the ratio\nbetween its mean response time and that of Shortest Remaining Processing Time\n(SRPT), the optimal policy when true sizes are known. Our question: is there a\nscheduling policy that (a) has approximation ratio near 1 when $\\alpha$ and\n$\\beta$ are near 1, (b) has approximation ratio bounded by some function of\n$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ even when they are far from 1, and (c) can be implemented\nwithout knowledge of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$?\nWe first show that naively running SRPT using estimated sizes in place of\ntrue sizes is not such a policy: its approximation ratio can be arbitrarily\nlarge for any fixed $\\beta < 1$. We then provide a simple variant of SRPT for\nestimated sizes that satisfies criteria (a), (b), and (c). In particular, we\nprove its approximation ratio approaches 1 uniformly as $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$\napproach 1. This is the first result showing this type of convergence for M/G/1\nscheduling.\nWe also study the Preemptive Shortest Job First (PSJF) policy, a cousin of\nSRPT. We show that, unlike SRPT, naively running PSJF using estimated sizes in\nplace of true sizes satisfies criteria (b) and (c), as well as a weaker version\nof (a).",

    "abstract": "An adaptive guidance system suitable for the terminal phase trajectory of a\nhypersonic strike weapon is optimized using reinforcement meta learning. The\nguidance system maps observations directly to commanded bank angle, angle of\nattack, and sideslip angle rates. Importantly, the observations are directly\nmeasurable from radar seeker outputs with minimal processing. The optimization\nframework implements a shaping reward that minimizes the line of sight rotation\nrate, with a terminal reward given if the agent satisfies path constraints and\nmeets terminal accuracy and speed criteria. We show that the guidance system\ncan adapt to off-nominal flight conditions including perturbation of\naerodynamic coefficient parameters, actuator failure scenarios, sensor scale\nfactor errors, and actuator lag, while satisfying heating rate, dynamic\npressure, and load path constraints, as well as a minimum impact speed\nconstraint. We demonstrate precision strike capability against a maneuvering\nground target and the ability to divert to a new target, the latter being\nimportant to maximize strike effectiveness for a group of hypersonic strike\nweapons. Moreover, we demonstrate a threat evasion strategy against\ninterceptors with limited midcourse correction capability, where the hypersonic\nstrike weapon implements multiple diverts to alternate targets, with the last\ndivert to the actual target. Finally, we include preliminary results for an\nintegrated guidance and control system in a six degrees-of-freedom environment.",

This paper presents a first attempt at addressing a\nfundamental question: What are the benefits from supervision and how does it\nbenefit? Starting from seeing that SCL is not better than random guessing if\nthe learning target is non-identifiable a priori, we propose a two-phase\nparadigm for SCL by explicitly considering structure identifiability. Following\nthis paradigm, we tackle the problem of SCL on discrete data and propose ML4C.\nThe core of ML4C is a binary classifier with a novel learning target: it\nclassifies whether an Unshielded Triple (UT) is a v-structure or not. Starting\nfrom an input dataset with the corresponding skeleton provided, ML4C orients\neach UT once it is classified as a v-structure. These v-structures are together\nused to construct the final output. To address the fundamental question of SCL,\nwe propose a principled method for ML4C featurization: we exploit the vicinity\nof a given UT (i.e., the neighbors of UT in skeleton), and derive features by\nconsidering the conditional dependencies and structural entanglement within the\nvicinity. We further prove that ML4C is asymptotically perfect. Last but\nforemost, thorough experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nML4C remarkably outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of\naccuracy, robustness, tolerance and transferability. In summary, ML4C shows\npromising results on validating the effectiveness of supervision for causal\nlearning.",

In this work, we focus on the uncertainty in\nsensing and perception, resulted from a limited field of view, occlusions, and\nsensing range. This problem is often tackled by considering hypothetical hidden\nobjects in occluded areas or beyond the sensing range to guarantee passive\nsafety. However, this may result in conservative planning and expensive\ncomputation, particularly when numerous hypothetical objects need to be\nconsidered. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based solution to manage\nuncertainty by optimizing for the worst case outcome. This approach is in\ncontrast to traditional RL, where the agents try to maximize the average\nexpected reward. The proposed approach is built on top of the Distributional RL\nwith its policy optimization maximizing the stochastic outcomes' lower bound.\nThis modification can be applied to a range of RL algorithms. As a\nproof-of-concept, the approach is applied to two different RL algorithms, Soft\nActor-Critic and DQN. The approach is evaluated against two challenging\nscenarios of pedestrians crossing with occlusion and curved roads with a\nlimited field of view.

This method replaces\nthe discontinuous function with a polynomial, potentially allowing for the\nintegration to occur over the entire domain, rather than integrating over\ncomplex subdomains. Although, eliminating the issues involved with\ndiscontinuous function integration, the equivalent polynomial tactic introduces\nits own set of problems.

We prove this result by showing that a natural relaxation of the\n$\\Delta$-coloring problem is a fixed point in the round elimination framework.\nAs a first application, we show that our $\\Delta$-coloring lower bound proof\ndirectly extends to arbdefective colorings.

For example, we obtain a tight\nlinear-in-$\\Delta$ lower bound for computing a maximal independent set in\n$\\Delta$-regular trees.

The behavioral planning is responsible for\nhigh-level decision making required to follow traffic rules and interact with\nother road participants.

The trajectories are\ngenerated through an optimization scheme to optimize a cost function based on\nmetrics related to smoothness, movability, and comfort, and subject to a set of\nconstraints derived from the planned behavior, safety considerations, and\nfeasibility. A common practice is to manually design the cost function and\nconstraints. Recent work has investigated learning the cost function from human\ndriving demonstrations.

By using a squared differential length as a Lyapunov-like function, its\nnonlinear stability analysis boils down to finding a suitable contraction\nmetric that satisfies a stability condition expressed as a linear matrix\ninequality, indicating that many parallels can be drawn between well-known\nlinear systems theory and contraction theory for nonlinear systems.\nFurthermore, contraction theory takes advantage of a superior robustness\nproperty of exponential stability used in conjunction with the comparison\nlemma. This yields much-needed safety and stability guarantees for neural\nnetwork-based control and estimation schemes, without resorting to a more\ninvolved method of using uniform asymptotic stability for input-to-state\nstability. Such distinctive features permit systematic construction of a\ncontraction metric via convex optimization, thereby obtaining an explicit\nexponential bound on the distance between a time-varying target trajectory and\nsolution trajectories perturbed externally due to disturbances and learning\nerrors. The objective of this paper is therefore to present a tutorial overview\nof contraction theory and its advantages in nonlinear stability analysis of\ndeterministic and stochastic systems, with an emphasis on deriving formal\nrobustness and stability guarantees for various learning-based and data-driven\nautomatic control methods. In particular, we provide a detailed review of\ntechniques for finding contraction metrics and associated control and\nestimation laws using deep neural networks.",

SolType allows developers to add\nrefinement type annotations and uses them to prove that arithmetic operations\ndo not lead to over- and under-flows.

    "abstract": "Current deep neural networks are highly overparameterized (up to billions of\nconnection weights) and nonlinear. Yet they can fit data almost perfectly\nthrough variants of gradient descent algorithms and achieve unexpected levels\nof prediction accuracy without overfitting. These are formidable results that\nescape the bias-variance predictions of statistical learning and pose\nconceptual challenges for non-convex optimization. In this paper, we use\nmethods from statistical physics of disordered systems to analytically study\nthe computational fallout of overparameterization in nonconvex neural network\nmodels. As the number of connection weights increases, we follow the changes of\nthe geometrical structure of different minima of the error loss function and\nrelate them to learning and generalisation performance. We find that there\nexist a gap between the SAT/UNSAT interpolation transition where solutions\nbegin to exist and the point where algorithms start to find solutions, i.e.\nwhere accessible solutions appear. This second phase transition coincides with\nthe discontinuous appearance of atypical solutions that are locally extremely\nentropic, i.e., flat regions of the weight space that are particularly\nsolution-dense and have good generalization properties. Although exponentially\nrare compared to typical solutions (which are narrower and extremely difficult\nto sample), entropic solutions are accessible to the algorithms used in\nlearning. We can characterize the generalization error of different solutions\nand optimize the Bayesian prediction, for data generated from a structurally\ndifferent network.

    "abstract": "A central goal in deep learning is to learn compact representations of\nfeatures at every layer of a neural network, which is useful for both\nunsupervised representation learning and structured network pruning. While\nthere is a growing body of work in structured pruning, current state-of-the-art\nmethods suffer from two key limitations: (i) instability during training, and\n(ii) need for an additional step of fine-tuning, which is resource-intensive.\nAt the core of these limitations is the lack of a systematic approach that\njointly prunes and refines weights during training in a single stage, and does\nnot require any fine-tuning upon convergence to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance.

In particular, we rigorously show in\nthis paper that, by regarding modeling errors of the learning schemes as\nexternal disturbances, the NCM control is capable of obtaining an explicit\nbound on the distance between a time-varying target trajectory and perturbed\nsolution trajectories, which exponentially decreases with time even under the\npresence of deterministic and stochastic perturbation. These useful features\npermit simultaneous synthesis of a contraction metric and associated control\nlaw by a neural network, thereby enabling real-time computable and probably\nrobust learning-based control for general control-affine nonlinear systems.",

    "title": "Deep Learning for Rain Fade Prediction in Satellite Communications",
    "abstract": "Line of sight satellite systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, high-altitude\nplatforms, and microwave links that operate on frequency bands such as Ka-band\nor higher are extremely susceptible to rain. Thus, rain fade forecasting for\nthese systems is critical because it allows the system to switch between ground\ngateways proactively before a rain fade event to maintain seamless service.\nAlthough empirical, statistical, and fade slope models can predict rain fade to\nsome extent, they typically require statistical measurements of rain\ncharacteristics in a given area and cannot be generalized to a large scale\nsystem. Furthermore, such models typically predict near-future rain fade events\nbut are incapable of forecasting far into the future, making proactive resource\nmanagement more difficult. In this paper, a deep learning (DL)-based\narchitecture is proposed that forecasts future rain fade using satellite and\nradar imagery data as well as link power measurements. Furthermore, the data\npreprocessing and architectural design have been thoroughly explained and\nmultiple experiments have been conducted. Experiments show that the proposed DL\narchitecture outperforms current state-of-the-art machine learning-based\nalgorithms in rain fade forecasting in the near and long term. Moreover, the\nresults indicate that radar data with weather condition information is more\neffective for short-term prediction, while satellite data with cloud movement\ninformation is more effective for long-term predictions.",

    "abstract": "Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is a fundamental problem in areas\nsuch as data management,information retrieval and machine learning. Recently,\nLi et al. proposed a learned approach named AdaptNN to support adaptive ANN\nquery processing. In the middle of query execution, AdaptNN collects a number\nof runtime features and predicts termination condition for each individual\nquery, by which better end-to-end latency is attained. Despite its efficiency,\nusing runtime features complicates the learning process and leads to\nperformance degradation. Radically different from AdaptNN, we argue that it is\npromising to predict termination condition before query exetution.\nParticularly, we developed Tao, a general learning framework for Terminating\nANN queries Adaptively using Only static features. Upon the arrival of a query,\nTao first maps the query to a local intrinsic dimension (LID) number, and then\npredicts the termination condition using LID instead of runtime features. By\ndecoupling prediction procedure from query execution, Tao eliminates the\nlaborious feature selection process involved in AdaptNN. Besides, two design\nprinciples are formulated to guide the application of Tao and improve the\nexplainability of the prediction model. We integrate two state-of-the-art\nindexing approaches, i.e., IMI and HNSW, into Tao, and evaluate the performance\nover several million to billion-scale datasets. Experimental results show that,\nin addition to its simplicity and generality , Tao achieves up to 2.69x speedup\neven compared to its counterpart, at the same high accuracy targets.",

    "abstract": "Although the multilingual Neural Machine Translation(NMT), which extends\nGoogle's multilingual NMT, has ability to perform zero-shot translation and the\niterative self-learning algorithm can improve the quality of zero-shot\ntranslation, it confronts with two problems: the multilingual NMT model is\nprone to generate wrong target language when implementing zero-shot\ntranslation; the self-learning algorithm, which uses beam search to generate\nsynthetic parallel data, demolishes the diversity of the generated source\nlanguage and amplifies the impact of the same noise during the iterative\nlearning process. In this paper, we propose the tagged-multilingual NMT model\nand improve the self-learning algorithm to handle these two problems. Firstly,\nwe extend the Google's multilingual NMT model and add target tokens to the\ntarget languages, which associates the start tag with the target language to\nensure that the source language can be translated to the required target\nlanguage. Secondly, we improve the self-learning algorithm by replacing beam\nsearch with random sample to increases the diversity of the generated data and\nmakes it properly cover the true data distribution. Experimental results on\nIWSLT show that the adjusted tagged-multilingual NMT separately obtains 9.41\nand 7.85 BLEU scores over the multilingual NMT on 2010 and 2017\nRomanian-Italian test sets.

The standard benchmarks in meta-learning\nare challenged by learning on diverse task distributions. The proposed network\nlearns the regularization function in a variational model and reconstructs MR\nimages with various under-sampling ratios or patterns that may or may not be\nseen in the training data by leveraging a heterogeneous dataset. Methods: We\npropose an unrolling network induced by learnable optimization algorithms (LOA)\nfor solving our nonconvex nonsmooth variational model for MRI reconstruction.\nIn this model, the learnable regularization function contains a task-invariant\ncommon feature encoder and task-specific learner represented by a shallow\nnetwork. To train the network we split the training data into two parts:\ntraining and validation, and introduce a bilevel optimization algorithm. The\nlower-level optimization trains task-invariant parameters for the feature\nencoder with fixed parameters of the task-specific learner on the training\ndataset, and the upper-level optimizes the parameters of the task-specific\nlearner on the validation dataset. Results: The average PSNR increases\nsignificantly compared to the network trained through conventional supervised\nlearning on the seen CS ratios. We test the result of quick adaption on the\nunseen tasks after meta-training and in the meanwhile saving half of the\ntraining time; Conclusion: We proposed a meta-learning framework consisting of\nthe base network architecture, design of regularization, and bi-level\noptimization-based training. The network inherits the convergence property of\nthe LOA and interpretation of the variational model. The generalization ability\nis improved by the designated regularization and bilevel optimization-based\ntraining algorithm.",

A major obstacle in the SLDG task is the\ndiscriminability-generalization bias: discriminative information in the labeled\nsource dataset may contain domain-specific bias, constraining the\ngeneralization of the trained model. To tackle this challenging task, we\npropose a novel method called Domain-Specific Bias Filtering (DSBF), which\ninitializes a discriminative model with the labeled source data and filters out\nits domain-specific bias with the unlabeled source data for generalization\nimprovement.

To perform the task,\nBayesian Regularization method was chosen as the training algorithm as it works\nbest even for smaller data supporting the wide range of the train data set. The\ntheoretical results show that the improved NN MPPT algorithm has higher\nefficiency compared with the Perturb and Observe method in the same\nenvironment, and the PV system can keep working at MPP without oscillation and\nprobability of any kind of misjudgment. So it can not only reduce misjudgment,\nbut also avoid power loss around the MPP. Moreover, we implemented the\nalgorithm in a hardware set-up and verified the theoretical result comparing it\nwith the empirical data.",

In the standard CONGEST\nmodel of distributed computing, the complexity of clique/cycle detection and\nlisting has received a lot of attention recently.\nIn this paper we consider the induced variant of subgraph detection, where\nthe goal is to decide whether the $n$-node input graph contains $H$ as an\n\\emph{induced} subgraph or not. We first show a $\\tilde{\\Omega}(n)$ lower bound\nfor detecting the existence of an induced $k$-cycle for any $k\\geq 4$ in the\nCONGEST model. This lower bound is tight for $k=4$, and shows that the induced\nvariant of $k$-cycle detection is much harder than the non-induced version.\nThis lower bound is proved via a reduction from two-party communication\ncomplexity. We complement this result by showing that for $5\\leq k\\leq 7$, this\n$\\tilde{\\Omega}(n)$ lower bound cannot be improved via the two-party\ncommunication framework.\nWe then show how to prove stronger lower bounds for larger values of $k$.\nMore precisely, we show that detecting an induced $k$-cycle for any $k\\geq 8$\nrequires $\\tilde{\\Omega}(n^{2-\\Theta{(1/k)}})$ rounds in the CONGEST model,\nnearly matching the known upper bound $\\tilde{O}(n^{2-\\Theta{(1/k)}})$ of the\ngeneral $k$-node subgraph detection (which also applies to the induced version)\nby Eden, Fiat, Fischer, Kuhn, and Oshman~[DISC 2019].\nFinally, we investigate the case where $H$ is the diamond (the diamond is\nobtained by adding an edge to a 4-cycle, or equivalently removing an edge from\na 4-clique), and show non-trivial upper and lower bounds on the complexity of\nthe induced version of diamond detecting and listing.",

    "abstract": "The planted densest subgraph detection problem refers to the task of testing\nwhether in a given (random) graph there is a subgraph that is unusually dense.\nSpecifically, we observe an undirected and unweighted graph on $n$ nodes. Under\nthe null hypothesis, the graph is a realization of an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi graph\nwith edge probability (or, density) $q$. Under the alternative, there is a\nsubgraph on $k$ vertices with edge probability $p>q$. The statistical as well\nas the computational barriers of this problem are well-understood for a wide\nrange of the edge parameters $p$ and $q$. In this paper, we consider a natural\nvariant of the above problem, where one can only observe a small part of the\ngraph using adaptive edge queries.\nFor this model, we determine the number of queries necessary and sufficient\nfor detecting the presence of the planted subgraph. Specifically, we show that\nany (possibly randomized) algorithm must make $\\mathsf{Q} =\n\\Omega(\\frac{n^2}{k^2\\chi^4(p||q)}\\log^2n)$ adaptive queries (on expectation)\nto the adjacency matrix of the graph to detect the planted subgraph with\nprobability more than $1/2$, where $\\chi^2(p||q)$ is the Chi-Square distance.\nOn the other hand, we devise a quasi-polynomial-time algorithm that finds the\nplanted subgraph with high probability by making $\\mathsf{Q} =\nO(\\frac{n^2}{k^2\\chi^4(p||q)}\\log^2n)$ adaptive queries. We then propose a\npolynomial-time algorithm which is able to detect the planted subgraph using\n$\\mathsf{Q} = O(\\frac{n^4}{k^4\\chi^2(p||q)}\\log n)$ queries. We conjecture that\nin the leftover regime, where $\\frac{n^2}{k^2}\\ll\\mathsf{Q}\\ll\n\\frac{n^4}{k^4}$, no polynomial-time algorithms exist; we give an evidence for\nthis hypothesis using the planted clique conjecture.

One of the causes of this limit is the belief that\nmaking things explainable alone is enough to have pragmatic explanations.

    "abstract": "We propose a new method for generating explanations with Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) and a tool to test its expressive power within a user\ninterface. In order to bridge the gap between philosophy and human-computer\ninterfaces, we show a new approach for the generation of interactive\nexplanations based on a sophisticated pipeline of AI algorithms for structuring\nnatural language documents into knowledge graphs, answering questions\neffectively and satisfactorily. With this work we aim to prove that the\nphilosophical theory of explanations presented by Achinstein can be actually\nadapted for being implemented into a concrete software application, as an\ninteractive and illocutionary process of answering questions. Specifically, our\ncontribution is an approach to frame illocution in a computer-friendly way, to\nachieve user-centrality with statistical question answering. In fact, we frame\nillocution, in an explanatory process, as that mechanism responsible for\nanticipating the needs of the explainee in the form of unposed, implicit,\narchetypal questions, hence improving the user-centrality of the underlying\nexplanatory process. More precisely, we hypothesise that given an arbitrary\nexplanatory process, increasing its goal-orientedness and degree of illocution\nresults in the generation of more usable (as per ISO 9241-210) explanations. We\ntested our hypotheses with a user-study involving more than 60 participants, on\ntwo XAI-based systems, one for credit approval (finance) and one for heart\ndisease prediction (healthcare). The results showed that our proposed solution\nproduced a statistically significant improvement (hence with a p-value lower\nthan 0.05) on effectiveness. This, combined with a visible alignment between\nthe increments in effectiveness and satisfaction, suggests that our\nunderstanding of illocution can be correct, giving evidence in favour of our\ntheory.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of allocating indivisible goods among $n$ agents with\nthe objective of maximizing Nash social welfare (NSW). This welfare function is\ndefined as the geometric mean of the agents' valuations and, hence, it strikes\na balance between the extremes of social welfare (arithmetic mean) and\negalitarian welfare (max-min value). Nash social welfare has been extensively\nstudied in recent years for various valuation classes. In particular, a notable\nnegative result is known when the agents' valuations are complement-free and\nare specified via value queries: for XOS valuations, one necessarily requires\nexponentially many value queries to find any sublinear (in $n$) approximation\nfor NSW. Indeed, this lower bound implies that stronger query models are needed\nfor finding better approximations. Towards this, we utilize demand oracles and\nXOS oracles; both of these query models are standard and have been used in\nprior work on social welfare maximization with XOS valuations.\nWe develop the first sublinear approximation algorithm for maximizing Nash\nsocial welfare under XOS valuations, specified via demand and XOS oracles.\nHence, this work breaks the $O(n)$-approximation barrier for NSW maximization\nunder XOS valuations. We obtain this result by developing a novel connection\nbetween NSW and social welfare under a capped version of the agents'\nvaluations. In addition to this insight, which might be of independent\ninterest, this work relies on an intricate combination of multiple technical\nideas, including the use of repeated matchings and the discrete moving knife\nmethod.",

The reduction makes use of two technique:\nindirect reduction and incremental construction. Indirect reduction means the\ngraph to be colored is not reduced to an LR(1) state machine directly. Instead,\nit is reduced to a context-free grammar from which an LR(1) state machine is\nderived. Furthermore, by considering the nodes in the graph to be colored one\nat a time, the context-free grammar is incrementally extended from a template\ncontext-free grammar that is for a two-node graph.

However, considering the correlation between the performance\nof leaders and their facial traits, empirical findings are mixed. This paper\nadds to the debate by focusing on two previously understudied aspects of facial\ntraits among political leaders: (i) previous studies have focused on electoral\nsuccess and achievement drive of politicians omitting their actual daily\nperformance after elections; (ii) previous research has analyzed individual\npoliticians omitting the context of social circumstances which potentially\ninfluence their performance. We address these issues by analyzing Ukrainian\nmembers of parliament (MPs) who voted for bills in six consecutive Verkhovna\nRada starting from Rada 4 (2002-06) to Rada 9 (2019-Present) to study\npoliticians' performance, which is defined as co-voting or cooperation between\nMPs in voting on the same bill. In simple words, we analyze whether politicians\ntend to follow leaders when voting. This ability to summon the votes of others\nis interpreted as better performance. To measure performance, we proposed a\ngeneric methodology named Feature Importance For Measuring Performance (FIMP)\nthat can be used in various scenarios. Using FIMP, our data suggest that MPs\nvote has no impact from their colleagues with higher or lower facial\nwidth-to-height ratio (fWHR), a popular measure of the facial trait.",

These studies evaluate readability and\nlegibility by means of different comprehension tasks and response variables. In\nthis paper, we examine these tasks and variables in studies that compare\nprogramming constructs, coding idioms, naming conventions, and formatting\nguidelines, e.g., recursive vs. iterative code. To that end, we have conducted\na systematic literature review where we found 54 relevant papers. Most of these\nstudies evaluate code readability and legibility by measuring the correctness\nof the subjects' results (83.3%) or simply asking their opinions (55.6%). Some\nstudies (16.7%) rely exclusively on the latter variable.There are still few\nstudies that monitor subjects' physical signs, such as brain activation regions\n(5%). Moreover, our study shows that some variables are multi-faceted. For\ninstance, correctness can be measured as the ability to predict the output of a\nprogram, answer questions about its behavior, or recall parts of it. These\nresults make it clear that different evaluation approaches require different\ncompetencies from subjects, e.g., tracing the program vs. summarizing its goal\nvs. memorizing its text. To assist researchers in the design of new studies and\nimprove our comprehension of existing ones, we model program comprehension as a\nlearning activity by adapting a preexisting learning taxonomy.

InfoGAN is\na classic method via maximizing Mutual Information (MI) to obtain interpretable\nlatent variables mapped to the target space. However, it did not emphasize\nindependent characteristic. To explicitly infer latent variables with\ninter-independence, we propose a novel GAN-based disentanglement framework via\nembedding Orthogonal Basis Expansion (OBE) into InfoGAN network\n(Inference-InfoGAN) in an unsupervised way. Under the OBE module, one set of\northogonal basis can be adaptively found to expand arbitrary data with\nindependence property. To ensure the target-wise interpretable representation,\nwe add a consistence constraint between the expansion coefficients and latent\nvariables on the base of MI maximization. Additionally, we design an\nalternating optimization step on the consistence constraint and orthogonal\nrequirement updating, so that the training of Inference-InfoGAN can be more\nconvenient. Finally, experiments validate that our proposed OBE module obtains\nadaptive orthogonal basis, which can express better independent characteristics\nthan fixed basis expression of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).

    "abstract": "This work proposes an optimization-based manipulation planning framework\nwhere the objectives are learned functionals of signed-distance fields that\nrepresent objects in the scene. Most manipulation planning approaches rely on\nanalytical models and carefully chosen abstractions/state-spaces to be\neffective. A central question is how models can be obtained from data that are\nnot primarily accurate in their predictions, but, more importantly, enable\nefficient reasoning within a planning framework, while at the same time being\nclosely coupled to perception spaces. We show that representing objects as\nsigned-distance fields not only enables to learn and represent a variety of\nmodels with higher accuracy compared to point-cloud and occupancy measure\nrepresentations, but also that SDF-based models are suitable for\noptimization-based planning. To demonstrate the versatility of our approach, we\nlearn both kinematic and dynamic models to solve tasks that involve hanging\nmugs on hooks and pushing objects on a table. We can unify these quite\ndifferent tasks within one framework, since SDFs are the common object\nrepresentation. Video: https://youtu.be/ga8Wlkss7co",

    "abstract": "The cleft lip and palate (CLP) speech intelligibility is distorted due to the\ndeformation in their articulatory system. For addressing the same, a few\nprevious works perform phoneme specific modification in CLP speech. In CLP\nspeech, both the articulation error and the nasalization distorts the\nintelligibility of a word. Consequently, modification of a specific phoneme may\nnot always yield in enhanced entire word-level intelligibility. For such cases,\nit is important to identify and isolate the phoneme specific error based on the\nknowledge of acoustic events. Accordingly, the phoneme specific error\nmodification algorithms can be exploited for transforming the specified errors\nand enhance the word-level intelligibility. Motivated by that, in this work, we\ncombine some of salient phoneme specific enhancement approaches and demonstrate\ntheir effectiveness in improving the word-level intelligibility of CLP speech.\nThe enhanced speech samples are evaluated using subjective and objective\nevaluation metrics.",

    "abstract": "Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has been extensively studied in recent\nyears, which typically involves four fundamental sentiment elements, including\nthe aspect category, aspect term, opinion term, and sentiment polarity.\nExisting studies usually consider the detection of partial sentiment elements,\ninstead of predicting the four elements in one shot. In this work, we introduce\nthe Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction (ASQP) task, aiming to jointly detect all\nsentiment elements in quads for a given opinionated sentence, which can reveal\na more comprehensive and complete aspect-level sentiment structure. We further\npropose a novel \\textsc{Paraphrase} modeling paradigm to cast the ASQP task to\na paraphrase generation process. On one hand, the generation formulation allows\nsolving ASQP in an end-to-end manner, alleviating the potential error\npropagation in the pipeline solution. On the other hand, the semantics of the\nsentiment elements can be fully exploited by learning to generate them in the\nnatural language form.

However, high costs and risks make\nit very hard to train autonomous cars in the real world. Simulations can\ntherefore be a powerful tool to enable training. Due to slightly different\nobservations, agents trained and evaluated solely in simulation often perform\nwell there but have difficulties in real-world environments.

In this work we introduce and study $\\gamma$-disqualification, a\nnew framework for reasoning about fairness-accuracy tradeoffs w.r.t a benchmark\nclass $H$ in the context of supervised learning. Our requirement stipulates\nthat a classifier should be disqualified if it is possible to improve its\nfairness by switching to another classifier from $H$ without paying \"too much\"\nin accuracy. The notion of \"too much\" is quantified via a parameter $\\gamma$\nthat serves as a vehicle for specifying acceptable tradeoffs between accuracy\nand fairness, in a way that is independent from the specific metrics used to\nquantify fairness and accuracy in a given task. Towards this objective, we\nestablish principled translations between units of accuracy and units of\n(un)fairness for different accuracy measures. We show $\\gamma$-disqualification\ncan be used to easily compare different learning strategies in terms of how\nthey trade-off fairness and accuracy, and we give an efficient reduction from\nthe problem of finding the optimal classifier that satisfies our requirement to\nthe problem of approximating the Pareto frontier of $H$.",

In this regard, it is suggested to quantify the\nfreshness of updates by using Age of Information (AoI) from the receiver's\nperspective. Specifically, the AoI measures the freshness over time. However,\nthe freshness in the content is neglected. In this paper, we introduce an\nage-based utility, named as Age of Changed Information (AoCI), which captures\nboth the passage of time and the change of information content. By modeling the\nunderlying physical process as a discrete time Markov chain, we investigate the\nAoCI in a time-slotted status update system, where a sensor samples the\nphysical process and transmits the update packets to the destination. With the\naim of minimizing the weighted sum of the AoCI and the update cost, we\nformulate an infinite horizon average cost Markov Decision Process. We show\nthat the optimal updating policy has a special structure with respect to the\nAoCI and identify the condition under which the special structure exists. By\nexploiting the special structure, we provide a low complexity relative policy\niteration algorithm that finds the optimal updating policy. We further\ninvestigate the optimal policy for two special cases. In the first case where\nthe state of the physical process transits with equiprobability, we show that\noptimal policy is of threshold type and derive the closed-form of the optimal\nthreshold. We then study a more generalized periodic Markov model of the\nphysical process in the second case.

By reformulating a recurrent model as a\nmulti-path model and analyzing the recurrent model through its multi-path\nensemble, we found that the recurrent model outperformed the corresponding\nfeed-forward one due to the former's compact and implicit multi-path ensemble\nthat allows approximating the complex function underlying recurrent biological\ncircuits with efficiency.

We then combined these computational analyses with content\nanalysis of related scientific publications to identify the main scholarly\ntopics, sub-themes, and cross-topic themes within scientific research on\nsustainable AI in energy. Our research identified eight dominant topics\nincluding sustainable buildings, AI-based DSSs for urban water management,\nclimate artificial intelligence, Agriculture 4, the convergence of AI with IoT,\nAI-based evaluation of renewable technologies, smart campus and engineering\neducation, and AI-based optimization. We then recommended 14 potential future\nresearch strands based on the observed theoretical gaps. Theoretically, this\nanalysis contributes to the existing literature on sustainable AI and\nsustainable energy, and practically, it intends to act as a general guide for\nenergy engineers and scientists, AI scientists, and social scientists to widen\ntheir knowledge of sustainability in AI and energy convergence research.",

    "abstract": "In this thesis, a computational framework for microstructural modelling of\ntransverse behaviour of heterogeneous materials is presented. The context of\nthis research is part of the broad and active field of Computational\nMicromechanics, which has emerged as an effective tool both to understand the\ninfluence of complex microstructures on the macro-mechanical response of\nengineering materials and to tailor-design innovative materials for specific\napplications through a proper modification of their microstructure. The\ncomputational framework presented in this thesis is based on the Virtual\nElement Method (VEM), a recently developed numerical technique able to provide\nrobust numerical results even with highly-distorted meshes. The peculiar\nfeatures of VEM have been exploited to analyse two-dimensional representations\nof heterogeneous materials microstructures. Ad-hoc polygonal multi-domain\nmeshing strategies have been developed and tested to exploit the discretisation\nfreedom that VEM allows. To further simplify the preprocessing stage of the\nanalysis and reduce the total computational cost, a novel hybrid formulation\nfor analysing multi-domain problems has been developed by combining the Virtual\nElement Method with the well-known Boundary Element Method (BEM). The hybrid\napproach has been used to study both composite material transverse behaviour in\npresence of inclusions with complex geometries and damage and crack propagation\nin the matrix phase. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the\npotential of the developed framework.",

With the aid of RISs, a wireless\nenvironment becomes part of the network design parameters that are subject to\noptimization.\nIn this tutorial paper, we focus our attention on communication models for\nRISs. First, we review the communication models that are most often employed in\nwireless communications and networks for analyzing and optimizing RISs, and\nelaborate on their advantages and limitations. Then, we concentrate on models\nfor RISs that are based on inhomogeneous sheets of surface impedance, and offer\na step-by-step tutorial on formulating electromagnetically-consistent\nanalytical models for optimizing the surface impedance. The differences between\nlocal and global designs are discussed and analytically formulated in terms of\nsurface power efficiency and reradiated power flux through the Poynting vector.\nFinally, with the aid of numerical results, we discuss how approximate global\ndesigns can be realized by using locally passive RISs with zero electrical\nresistance (i.e., inhomogeneous reactance boundaries with no local power\namplification), even for large angles of reflection and at high power\nefficiency.",

The Fog has been\nintroduced to augment the apps with machines located at the network edge close\nto the end-users. However, edge machines are usually resource constrained.\nThus, the execution of online data-analytics on edge machines may not be\nfeasible if the time complexity of the data-analytics algorithm is high. To\novercome this, multiple instances of the back-end should be deployed on edge\nand remote machines. In this case, the research question is how the switching\nof the app among the instances of the back-end can be dynamically decided based\non the response time of the service instances. To answer this, we contribute an\nAI approach that trains machine-learning models of the response time of service\ninstances. Our approach extends a back-end as a service into an AI\nself-back-end as a service that self-decides at runtime the right edge/remote\ninstance that achieves the lowest response-time.

This idea was criticized by Hume and others as untenable leading to the\nfamous problem of induction. It wasn't until the work of Karl Popper that this\nproblem was solved, by demonstrating that induction is not the basis for\nscience and that the development of scientific knowledge is instead based on\nthe same principles as biological evolution. Today, machine learning is also\ntaught as being rooted in induction from big data. Solomonoff induction\nimplemented in an idealized Bayesian agent (Hutter's AIXI) is widely discussed\nand touted as a framework for understanding AI algorithms, even though\nreal-world attempts to implement something like AIXI immediately encounter\nfatal problems. In this paper, we contrast frameworks based on induction with\nDonald T. Campbell's universal Darwinism. We show that most AI algorithms in\nuse today can be understood as using an evolutionary trial and error process\nsearching over a solution space. In this work we argue that a universal\nDarwinian framework provides a better foundation for understanding AI systems.\nMoreover, at a more meta level the process of development of all AI algorithms\ncan be understood under the framework of universal Darwinism.",

    "abstract": "Jointly achieving safety and efficiency in human-robot interaction (HRI)\nsettings is a challenging problem, as the robot's planning objectives may be at\nodds with the human's own intent and expectations. Recent approaches ensure\nsafe robot operation in uncertain environments through a supervisory control\nscheme, sometimes called \"shielding\", which overrides the robot's nominal plan\nwith a safety fallback strategy when a safety-critical event is imminent. These\nreactive \"last-resort\" strategies (typically in the form of aggressive\nemergency maneuvers) focus on preserving safety without efficiency\nconsiderations; when the nominal planner is unaware of possible safety\noverrides, shielding can be activated more frequently than necessary, leading\nto degraded performance. In this work, we propose a new shielding-based\nplanning approach that allows the robot to plan efficiently by explicitly\naccounting for possible future shielding events. Leveraging recent work on\nBayesian human motion prediction, the resulting robot policy proactively\nbalances nominal performance with the risk of high-cost emergency maneuvers\ntriggered by low-probability human behaviors. We formalize Shielding-Aware\nRobust Planning (SHARP) as a stochastic optimal control problem and propose a\ncomputationally efficient framework for finding tractable approximate solutions\nat runtime. Our method outperforms the shielding-agnostic motion planning\nbaseline (equipped with the same human intent inference scheme) on simulated\ndriving examples with human trajectories taken from the recently released Waymo\nOpen Motion Dataset.",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing paradigms have emerged as a major facility to store and\nprocess the massive data produced by various business units, public\norganizations, Internet-of-Things, and cyber-physical systems. To meet users'\nperformance requirements while maximizing resource utilization to achieve\ncost-efficiency, cloud administrators leverage schedulers to orchestrate tasks\nto different physical nodes and allow applications from different users to\nshare the same physical node. On the other hand, micro-architectural attacks\ncan exploit the shared resources to compromise the confidentiality/integrity of\na co-located victim application. Since co-location is an essential requirement\nfor micro-architectural attacks, in this work, we investigate whether attackers\ncan exploit the cloud schedulers to satisfy the co-location requirement. Our\nanalysis shows that for cloud schedulers that allow users to submit application\nrequirements, an attacker can carefully select the attacker's application\nrequirements to influence the scheduler to co-locate it with a targeted victim\napplication. We call such attack Replication Attack (Repttack). Our\nexperimental results, in both a simulated cluster environment and a real\ncluster, show similar trends; a single attack instance can reach up to 50%\nco-location rate and with only 5 instances the co-location rate can reach up to\n80%. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate a mitigation strategy that can help\ndefend against Repttack. We believe that our results highlight the fact that\nschedulers in multi-user clusters need to be more carefully designed with\nsecurity in mind, and the process of making scheduling decisions should involve\nas little user-defined information as possible.",

To sufficiently\nutilize the survival data to train transformers from scratch, multiple\nauxiliary tasks are designed for multi-task learning. The model hence learns a\nstrong shared representation from all these tasks and in turn serves for better\nsurvival analysis.

    "title": "A Case Study to Reveal if an Area of Interest has a Trend in Ongoing  Tweets Using Word and Sentence Embeddings",
    "abstract": "In the field of Natural Language Processing, information extraction from\ntexts has been the objective of many researchers for years. Many different\ntechniques have been applied in order to reveal the opinion that a tweet might\nhave, thus understanding the sentiment of the small writing up to 280\ncharacters. Other than figuring out the sentiment of a tweet, a study can also\nfocus on finding the correlation of the tweets with a certain area of interest,\nwhich constitutes the purpose of this study. In order to reveal if an area of\ninterest has a trend in ongoing tweets, we have proposed an easily applicable\nautomated methodology in which the Daily Mean Similarity Scores that show the\nsimilarity between the daily tweet corpus and the target words representing our\narea of interest is calculated by using a na\\\"ive correlation-based technique\nwithout training any Machine Learning Model. The Daily Mean Similarity Scores\nhave mainly based on cosine similarity and word/sentence embeddings computed by\nMultilanguage Universal Sentence Encoder and showed main opinion stream of the\ntweets with respect to a certain area of interest, which proves that an ongoing\ntrend of a specific subject on Twitter can easily be captured in almost real\ntime by using the proposed methodology in this study. We have also compared the\neffectiveness of using word versus sentence embeddings while applying our\nmethodology and realized that both give almost the same results, whereas using\nword embeddings requires less computational time than sentence embeddings, thus\nbeing more effective. This paper will start with an introduction followed by\nthe background information about the basics, then continue with the explanation\nof the proposed methodology and later on finish by interpreting the results and\nconcluding the findings.",

    "abstract": "Thompson Sampling has been widely used for contextual bandit problems due to\nthe flexibility of its modeling power. However, a general theory for this class\nof methods in the frequentist setting is still lacking. In this paper, we\npresent a theoretical analysis of Thompson Sampling, with a focus on\nfrequentist regret bounds. In this setting, we show that the standard Thompson\nSampling is not aggressive enough in exploring new actions, leading to\nsuboptimality in some pessimistic situations. A simple modification called\nFeel-Good Thompson Sampling, which favors high reward models more aggressively\nthan the standard Thompson Sampling, is proposed to remedy this problem. We\nshow that the theoretical framework can be used to derive Bayesian regret\nbounds for standard Thompson Sampling, and frequentist regret bounds for\nFeel-Good Thompson Sampling. It is shown that in both cases, we can reduce the\nbandit regret problem to online least squares regression estimation. For the\nfrequentist analysis, the online least squares regression bound can be directly\nobtained using online aggregation techniques which have been well studied. The\nresulting bandit regret bound matches the minimax lower bound in the finite\naction case. Moreover, the analysis can be generalized to handle a class of\nlinearly embeddable contextual bandit problems (which generalizes the popular\nlinear contextual bandit model). The obtained result again matches the minimax\nlower bound. Finally we illustrate that the analysis can be extended to handle\nsome MDP problems.",

    "abstract": "Citrus juices and fruits are commodities with great economic potential in the\ninternational market, but productivity losses caused by mites and other pests\nare still far from being a good mark. Despite the integrated pest mechanical\naspect, only a few works on automatic classification have handled images with\norange mite characteristics, which means tiny and noisy regions of interest. On\nthe computational side, attention-based models have gained prominence in deep\nlearning research, and, along with weakly supervised learning algorithms, they\nhave improved tasks performed with some label restrictions. In agronomic\nresearch of pests and diseases, these techniques can improve classification\nperformance while pointing out the location of mites and insects without\nspecific labels, reducing deep learning development costs related to generating\nbounding boxes. In this context, this work proposes an attention-based\nactivation map approach developed to improve the classification of tiny regions\ncalled Two-Weighted Activation Mapping, which also produces locations using\nfeature map scores learned from class labels. We apply our method in a\ntwo-stage network process called Attention-based Multiple Instance Learning\nGuided by Saliency Maps. We analyze the proposed approach in two challenging\ndatasets, the Citrus Pest Benchmark, which was captured directly in the field\nusing magnifying glasses, and the Insect Pest, a large pest image benchmark. In\naddition, we evaluate and compare our models with weakly supervised methods,\nsuch as Attention-based Deep MIL and WILDCAT. The results show that our\nclassifier is superior to literature methods that use tiny regions in their\nclassification tasks, surpassing them in all scenarios by at least 16\npercentage points. Moreover, our approach infers bounding box locations for\nsalient insects, even training without any location labels.",

    "abstract": "In neuroscience, researchers have developed informal notions of what it means\nto reverse engineer a system, e.g., being able to model or simulate a system in\nsome sense. A recent influential paper of Jonas and Kording, that examines a\nmicroprocessor using techniques from neuroscience, suggests that common\ntechniques to understand neural systems are inadequate. Part of the difficulty,\nas a previous work of Lazebnik noted, lies in lack of formal language. We\nprovide a theoretical framework for defining reverse engineering of\ncomputational systems, motivated by the neuroscience context. Of specific\ninterest are recent works where, increasingly, interventions are being made to\nalter the function of the neural circuitry to both understand the system and\ntreat disorders. Starting from Lazebnik's viewpoint that understanding a system\nmeans you can ``fix it'', and motivated by use-cases in neuroscience, we\npropose the following requirement on reverse engineering: once an agent claims\nto have reverse-engineered a neural circuit, they subsequently need to be able\nto: (a) provide a minimal set of interventions to change the input/output (I/O)\nbehavior of the circuit to a desired behavior; (b) arrive at this minimal set\nof interventions while operating under bounded rationality constraints (e.g.,\nlimited memory) to rule out brute-force approaches. Under certain assumptions,\nwe show that this reverse engineering goal falls within the class of\nundecidable problems. Next, we examine some canonical computational systems and\nreverse engineering goals (as specified by desired I/O behaviors) where reverse\nengineering can indeed be performed. Finally, using an exemplar network, the\n``reward network'' in the brain, we summarize the state of current\nneuroscientific understanding, and discuss how computer-science and\ninformation-theoretic concepts can inform goals of future neuroscience studies.",

Navigating discrete terrain is challenging for\nquadrupeds because the motion of the robot can be aperiodic, highly dynamic,\nand blind for the hind legs of the robot. Additionally, the robot needs to\nreason over both the feasible footholds as well as robot velocity by speeding\nup and slowing down at different parts of the terrain. We build an offline\nlibrary of periodic gaits which span two trotting steps on the robot, and\nswitch between different motion primitives to achieve aperiodic motions of\ndifferent step lengths on an A1 robot. The motion library is used to provide\ntargets to a geometric model predictive controller which controls stance. To\nincorporate visual feedback, we use terrain mapping tools to build a local\nheight map of the terrain around the robot using RGB and depth cameras, and\nextract feasible foothold locations around both the front and hind legs of the\nrobot.

    "abstract": "Online interactions with the environment to collect data samples for training\na Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent is not always feasible due to economic and\nsafety concerns. The goal of Offline Reinforcement Learning is to address this\nproblem by learning effective policies using previously collected datasets.\nStandard off-policy RL algorithms are prone to overestimations of the values of\nout-of-distribution (less explored) actions and are hence unsuitable for\nOffline RL. Behavior regularization, which constraints the learned policy\nwithin the support set of the dataset, has been proposed to tackle the\nlimitations of standard off-policy algorithms. In this paper, we improve the\nbehavior regularized offline reinforcement learning and propose BRAC+. First,\nwe propose quantification of the out-of-distribution actions and conduct\ncomparisons between using Kullback-Leibler divergence versus using Maximum Mean\nDiscrepancy as the regularization protocol. We propose an analytical upper\nbound on the KL divergence as the behavior regularizer to reduce variance\nassociated with sample based estimations. Second, we mathematically show that\nthe learned Q values can diverge even using behavior regularized policy update\nunder mild assumptions. This leads to large overestimations of the Q values and\nperformance deterioration of the learned policy. To mitigate this issue, we add\na gradient penalty term to the policy evaluation objective. By doing so, the Q\nvalues are guaranteed to converge. On challenging offline RL benchmarks, BRAC+\noutperforms the baseline behavior regularized approaches by 40%~87% and the\nstate-of-the-art approach by 6%.",

The key difficulty in those domains\nis that a positive reward signal becomes {\\em exponentially rare} as the\nminimal solution length increases. So, an RL approach loses its training\nsignal. There has been promising recent progress by using a curriculum-driven\nlearning approach that is designed to solve a single hard instance. We present\na novel {\\em automated} curriculum approach that dynamically selects from a\npool of unlabeled training instances of varying task complexity guided by our\n{\\em difficulty quantum momentum} strategy. We show how the smoothness of the\ntask hardness impacts the final learning results. In particular, as the size of\nthe instance pool increases, the ``hardness gap'' decreases, which facilitates\na smoother automated curriculum based learning process. Our automated\ncurriculum approach dramatically improves upon the previous approaches. We show\nour results on Sokoban, which is a traditional PSPACE-complete planning problem\nand presents a great challenge even for specialized solvers. Our RL agent can\nsolve hard instances that are far out of reach for any previous\nstate-of-the-art Sokoban solver. In particular, our approach can uncover plans\nthat require hundreds of steps, while the best previous search methods would\ntake many years of computing time to solve such instances. In addition, we show\nthat we can further boost the RL performance with an intricate coupling of our\nautomated curriculum approach with a curiosity-driven search strategy and a\ngraph neural net representation.",

    "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting is a notorious issue in deep learning, referring to\nthe fact that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) could forget the knowledge about\nearlier tasks when learning new tasks. To address this issue, continual\nlearning has been developed to learn new tasks sequentially and perform\nknowledge transfer from the old tasks to the new ones without forgetting. While\nrecent structure-based learning methods show the capability of alleviating the\nforgetting problem, these methods start from a redundant full-size network and\nrequire a complex learning process to gradually grow-and-prune or search the\nnetwork structure for each task, which is inefficient. To address this problem\nand enable efficient network expansion for new tasks, we first develop a\nlearnable sparse growth method eliminating the additional pruning/searching\nstep in previous structure-based methods. Building on this learnable sparse\ngrowth method, we then propose GROWN, a novel end-to-end continual learning\nframework to dynamically grow the model only when necessary. Different from all\nprevious structure-based methods, GROWN starts from a small seed network,\ninstead of a full-sized one. We validate GROWN on multiple datasets against\nstate-of-the-art methods, which shows superior performance in both accuracy and\nmodel size.

Though designing a\nreliable and secure lightweight strong PUF is challenging, there is continuing\nefforts to fulfill this gap due to wide range of applications enabled by strong\nPUF. It was prospected that the combination of MAX and MIN bit-wise operation\nis promising for improving the modeling resilience when MAX and MIN are\nemployed in the PUF recomposition. The main rationale lies on the fact that\neach bit-wise might be mainly vulnerable to one specific type of modeling\nattack, combining them can have an improved holistic resilience. This work is\nto first evaluate the main PUF performance, in particular,uniformity and\nreliability of the OR-AND-XOR-PUF(OAX-PUF)-(x, y, z)-OAX-PUF. Compared with the\nmost used l-XOR-PUF, the (x, y, z)-OAX-PUF eventually exhibits better\nreliability given l=x+y+z without degrading the uniformity retaining to be 50%.\nWe further examine the modeling resilience of the (x, y, z)-OAX-PUF with four\npowerful attacking strategies to date, which are Logistic Regression (LR)\nattack, reliability assisted CMA-ES attack, multilayer perceptron (MLP) attack,\nand the most recent hybrid LR-reliability attack. In comparison with the\nXOR-APUF, the OAX-APUF successfully defeats the CAM-ES attack. However, it\nshows no notable modeling accuracy drop against other three attacks, though the\nattacking times have been greatly prolonged to LR and hybrid LR-reliability\nattacks. Overall, the OAX recomposition could be an alternative lightweight\nrecomposition method compared to XOR towards constructing strong PUFs if the\nunderlying PUF, e.g., FF-APUF, has exhibited improved resilience to modeling\nattack, because the OAX incurs smaller reliability degradation compared to XOR.",

The proposed method is then\nextended into 3D environments. The performance of the mentioned strategies are\nverified by extensive computer simulations, and good results are obtained.\nFurthermore, the more challenging dynamic environment situation is taken into\nour consideration. We tackled this problem by developing a new path planning\nmethod that utilizes the integrated environment representation and\nreinforcement learning.

    "abstract": "Recent work has raised concerns on the risk of spurious correlations and\nunintended biases in statistical machine learning models that threaten model\nrobustness and fairness. In this paper, we propose a simple and intuitive\nregularization approach to integrate causal knowledge during model training and\nbuild a robust and fair model by emphasizing causal features and de-emphasizing\nspurious features. Specifically, we first manually identify causal and spurious\nfeatures with principles inspired from the counterfactual framework of causal\ninference. Then, we propose a regularization approach to penalize causal and\nspurious features separately. By adjusting the strength of the penalty for each\ntype of feature, we build a predictive model that relies more on causal\nfeatures and less on non-causal features. We conduct experiments to evaluate\nmodel robustness and fairness on three datasets with multiple metrics.\nEmpirical results show that the new models built with causal awareness\nsignificantly improve model robustness with respect to counterfactual texts and\nmodel fairness with respect to sensitive attributes.",

    "abstract": "In medical image classification tasks, it is common to find that the number\nof normal samples far exceeds the number of abnormal samples. In such\nclass-imbalanced situations, reliable training of deep neural networks\ncontinues to be a major challenge. Under these circumstances, the predicted\nclass confidence may be biased toward the majority class. Calibration has been\nsuggested to alleviate some of these effects. However, there is insufficient\nanalysis explaining when and whether calibrating a model would be beneficial in\nimproving performance. In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the\neffect of model calibration on its performance on two medical image modalities,\nnamely, chest X-rays (CXRs) and fundus images, using various deep learning\nclassifier backbones. For this, we study the following variations: (i) the\ndegree of imbalances in the dataset used for training; (ii) calibration\nmethods; and, (iii) two classification thresholds, namely, default decision\nthreshold of 0.5, and optimal threshold from precision-recall (PR) curves. Our\nresults indicate that at the default operating threshold of 0.5, the\nperformance achieved through calibration is significantly superior (p < 0.05)\nto an uncalibrated model. However, at the PR-guided threshold, these gains were\nnot significantly different (p > 0.05). This finding holds for both image\nmodalities and at varying degrees of imbalance.",

Different from the use of costly fully supervised learning\nformulation with pixel-wise annotations in the literature, this study\ninvestigates the feasibility of accurate CDR measurement in fundus images using\nonly tight bounding box supervision. For this purpose, we develop a two-task\nnetwork for accurate CDR measurement, one for weakly supervised image\nsegmentation, and the other for bounding-box regression. The weakly supervised\nimage segmentation task is implemented based on generalized multiple instance\nlearning formulation and smooth maximum approximation, and the bounding-box\nregression task outputs class-specific bounding box prediction in a single\nscale at the original image resolution. To get accurate bounding box\nprediction, a class-specific bounding-box normalizer and an expected\nintersection-over-union are proposed. In the experiments, the proposed approach\nwas evaluated by a testing set with 1200 images using CDR error and F1 score\nfor CDR measurement and dice coefficient for image segmentation. A grader study\nwas conducted to compare the performance of the proposed approach with those of\nindividual graders. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach\noutperforms the state-of-the-art performance obtained from the fully supervised\nimage segmentation (FSIS) approach using pixel-wise annotation for CDR\nmeasurement, which is also better than those of individual graders.

    "title": "Unified Likelihood Ratio Estimation for High- to Zero-frequency N-grams",
    "abstract": "Likelihood ratios (LRs), which are commonly used for probabilistic data\nprocessing, are often estimated based on the frequency counts of individual\nelements obtained from samples. In natural language processing, an element can\nbe a continuous sequence of $N$ items, called an $N$-gram, in which each item\nis a word, letter, etc. In this paper, we attempt to estimate LRs based on\n$N$-gram frequency information. A naive estimation approach that uses only\n$N$-gram frequencies is sensitive to low-frequency (rare) $N$-grams and not\napplicable to zero-frequency (unobserved) $N$-grams; these are known as the\nlow- and zero-frequency problems, respectively. To address these problems, we\npropose a method for decomposing $N$-grams into item units and then applying\ntheir frequencies along with the original $N$-gram frequencies. Our method can\nobtain the estimates of unobserved $N$-grams by using the unit frequencies.\nAlthough using only unit frequencies ignores dependencies between items, our\nmethod takes advantage of the fact that certain items often co-occur in\npractice and therefore maintains their dependencies by using the relevant\n$N$-gram frequencies. We also introduce a regularization to achieve robust\nestimation for rare $N$-grams. Our experimental results demonstrate that our\nmethod is effective at solving both problems and can effectively control\ndependencies.",

    "abstract": "Stream-based active learning (AL) is an efficient training data collection\nmethod, and it is used to reduce human annotation cost required in machine\nlearning. However, it is difficult to say that the human cost is low enough\nbecause most previous studies have assumed that an oracle is a human with\ndomain knowledge. In this study, we propose a method to replace a part of the\noracle's work in stream-based AL by self-training with weak labeling using a\nrobot arm. A camera attached to a robot arm takes a series of image data\nrelated to a streamed object, which should have the same label. We use this\ninformation as a weak label to connect a pseudo-label (estimated class label)\nand a target instance. Our method selects two data from a series of image data;\nhigh confidence data for correcting pseudo-labels and low confidence data for\nimproving the performance of the classifier. We paired a pseudo-label provided\nto high confidence data with a target instance (low confidence data). By using\nthis technique, we mitigate the inefficiency in self-training, that is,\ndifficulty in creating pseudo-labeled training data with a high impact on the\ntarget classifier. In the experiments, we employed the proposed method in the\nclassification task of objects on a belt conveyor. We evaluated the performance\nagainst human cost on multiple scenarios considering the temporal variation of\ndata. The proposed method achieves the same or better performance as the\nconventional methods while reducing human cost.",

It is based on a new clustering method, Determinant MaxImization\n(DMI)-clustering, and a key conceptual idea that information elicitation\nwithout ground-truth can be seen as a clustering problem. Of independent\ninterest, DMI-clustering is a general clustering method that aims to maximize\nthe volume of the simplex consisting of each cluster's mean multiplying the\nproduct of the cluster sizes. We show that DMI-clustering is invariant to any\nnon-degenerate affine transformation for all data points. When the data point's\ndimension is a constant, DMI-clustering can be solved in polynomial time. In\ngeneral, we present a simple heuristic for DMI-clustering which is very similar\nto Lloyd's algorithm for k-means.

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose an approach based on an Online Feedback Optimization\n(OFO) controller with grid input-output sensitivity estimation for real-time\ngrid operation, e.g., at subsecond time scales. The OFO controller uses grid\nmeasurements as feedback to update the value of the controllable elements in\nthe grid, and track the solution of a time-varying AC Optimal Power Flow\n(AC-OPF). Instead of relying on a full grid model, e.g., grid admittance\nmatrix, OFO only requires the steady-state sensitivity relating a change in the\ncontrollable inputs, e.g., power injections set-points, to a change in the\nmeasured outputs, e.g., voltage magnitudes. Since an inaccurate sensitivity may\nlead to a model-mismatch and jeopardize the performance, we propose a recursive\nleast-squares estimation that enables OFO to learn the sensitivity from\nmeasurements during real-time operation, turning OFO into a model-free\napproach. We analytically certify the convergence of the proposed OFO with\nsensitivity estimation, and validate its performance on a simulation using the\nIEEE 123-bus test feeder, and comparing it against a state-of-the-art OFO with\nconstant sensitivity.",

Fingerprint matching is a vital and challenging issue in\nfingerprint recognition systems. Most fingerprint matching algorithms are\nminutiae-based. The minutiae in fingerprints can be determined by their\ndiscontinuity. Ridge ending and ridge bifurcation are two frequently used\nminutiae in most fingerprint-based matching algorithms.\nThis paper presents a new minutiae-based fingerprint matching using the onion\npeeling approach. In the proposed method, fingerprints are aligned to find the\nmatched minutiae points. Then, the nested convex polygons of matched minutiae\npoints are constructed and the comparison between peer-to-peer polygons is\nperformed by the turning function distance. Simplicity, accuracy, and low time\ncomplexity of the Onion peeling approach are three important factors that make\nit a standard method for fingerprint matching purposes. The performance of the\nproposed algorithm is evaluated on the database $FVC2002$. The results show\nthat fingerprints of the same fingers have higher scores than different\nfingers. Since the fingerprints that the difference between the number of their\nlayers is more than $2$ and the minutiae matching score lower than 0.15 are\nignored, the better results are obtained.",

Most existing GNNs assume strong homophily of graph structure and\napply permutation-invariant local aggregation of neighbors to learn a\nrepresentation for each node. However, they fail to generalize to heterophilic\ngraphs, where most neighboring nodes have different labels or features, and the\nrelevant nodes are distant. Few recent studies attempt to address this problem\nby combining multiple hops of hidden representations of central nodes (i.e.,\nmulti-hop-based approaches) or sorting the neighboring nodes based on attention\nscores (i.e., ranking-based approaches). As a result, these approaches have\nsome apparent limitations. On the one hand, multi-hop-based approaches do not\nexplicitly distinguish relevant nodes from a large number of multi-hop\nneighborhoods, leading to a severe over-smoothing problem. On the other hand,\nranking-based models do not joint-optimize node ranking with end tasks and\nresult in sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we present Graph Pointer Neural\nNetworks (GPNN) to tackle the challenges mentioned above. We leverage a pointer\nnetwork to select the most relevant nodes from a large amount of multi-hop\nneighborhoods, which constructs an ordered sequence according to the\nrelationship with the central node. 1D convolution is then applied to extract\nhigh-level features from the node sequence. The pointer-network-based ranker in\nGPNN is joint-optimized with other parts in an end-to-end manner. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on six public node classification datasets with\nheterophilic graphs. The results show that GPNN significantly improves the\nclassification performance of state-of-the-art methods.

    "title": "Software Evolution Understanding: Automatic Extraction of Software  Identifiers Map for Object-Oriented Software Systems",
    "abstract": "Software companies usually develop a set of product variants within the same\nfamily that share certain functions and differ in others. Variations across\nsoftware variants occur to meet different customer requirements. Thus, software\nproduct variants evolve overtime to cope with new requirements. A software\nengineer who deals with this family may find it difficult to understand the\nevolution scenarios that have taken place over time. In addition, software\nidentifier names are important resources to understand the evolution scenarios\nin this family. This paper introduces an automatic approach called Juana's\napproach to detect the evolution scenario across two product variants at the\nsource code level and identifies the common and unique software identifier\nnames across software variants source code. Juana's approach refers to common\nand unique identifier names as a software identifiers map and computes it by\ncomparing software variants to each other. Juana considers all software\nidentifier names such as package, class, attribute, and method. The novelty of\nthis approach is that it exploits common and unique identifier names across the\nsource code of software variants, to understand the evolution scenarios across\nsoftware family in an efficient way. For validity, Juana was applied on ArgoUML\nand Mobile Media software variants. The results of this evaluation validate the\nrelevance and the performance of the approach as all evolution scenarios were\ncorrectly detected via a software identifiers map.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning paradigm that enables\nmultiple clients to jointly train a model to take benefits from diverse\ndatasets from the clients without sharing their local training datasets. FL\nhelps reduce data privacy risks. Unfortunately, FL still exist several issues\nregarding privacy and security. First, it is possible to leak sensitive\ninformation from the shared training parameters. Second, malicious clients can\ncollude with each other to steal data, models from regular clients or corrupt\nthe global training model. To tackle these challenges, we propose SecFL - a\nconfidential federated learning framework that leverages Trusted Execution\nEnvironments (TEEs). SecFL performs the global and local training inside TEE\nenclaves to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the computations\nagainst powerful adversaries with privileged access. SecFL provides a\ntransparent remote attestation mechanism, relying on the remote attestation\nprovided by TEEs, to allow clients to attest the global training computation as\nwell as the local training computation of each other. Thus, all malicious\nclients can be detected using the remote attestation mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of 3D human body shape and pose estimation\nfrom an RGB image. This is often an ill-posed problem, since multiple plausible\n3D bodies may match the visual evidence present in the input - particularly\nwhen the subject is occluded. Thus, it is desirable to estimate a distribution\nover 3D body shape and pose conditioned on the input image instead of a single\n3D reconstruction. We train a deep neural network to estimate a hierarchical\nmatrix-Fisher distribution over relative 3D joint rotation matrices (i.e. body\npose), which exploits the human body's kinematic tree structure, as well as a\nGaussian distribution over SMPL body shape parameters. To further ensure that\nthe predicted shape and pose distributions match the visual evidence in the\ninput image, we implement a differentiable rejection sampler to impose a\nreprojection loss between ground-truth 2D joint coordinates and samples from\nthe predicted distributions, projected onto the image plane. We show that our\nmethod is competitive with the state-of-the-art in terms of 3D shape and pose\nmetrics on the SSP-3D and 3DPW datasets, while also yielding a structured\nprobability distribution over 3D body shape and pose, with which we can\nmeaningfully quantify prediction uncertainty and sample multiple plausible 3D\nreconstructions to explain a given input image.

As a result, deep\nlearning models developed for sequence modeling, like recurrent neural networks\n(RNNs) are common architecture for EHR-based clinical events predictive models.\nWhile a large variety of RNN models were proposed in the literature, it is\nunclear if complex architecture innovations will offer superior predictive\nperformance.

    "abstract": "Today's VQA models still tend to capture superficial linguistic correlations\nin the training set and fail to generalize to the test set with different QA\ndistributions. To reduce these language biases, recent VQA works introduce an\nauxiliary question-only model to regularize the training of targeted VQA model,\nand achieve dominating performance on diagnostic benchmarks for\nout-of-distribution testing. However, due to complex model design, these\nensemble-based methods are unable to equip themselves with two indispensable\ncharacteristics of an ideal VQA model: 1) Visual-explainable: The model should\nrely on the right visual regions when making decisions. 2) Question-sensitive:\nThe model should be sensitive to the linguistic variations in questions. To\nthis end, we propose a novel model-agnostic Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing\nand Training (CSST) strategy. After training with CSST, VQA models are forced\nto focus on all critical objects and words, which significantly improves both\nvisual-explainable and question-sensitive abilities. Specifically, CSST is\ncomposed of two parts: Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing (CSS) and\nCounterfactual Samples Training (CST). CSS generates counterfactual samples by\ncarefully masking critical objects in images or words in questions and\nassigning pseudo ground-truth answers. CST not only trains the VQA models with\nboth complementary samples to predict respective ground-truth answers, but also\nurges the VQA models to further distinguish the original samples and\nsuperficially similar counterfactual ones. To facilitate the CST training, we\npropose two variants of supervised contrastive loss for VQA, and design an\neffective positive and negative sample selection mechanism based on CSS.\nExtensive experiments have shown the effectiveness of CSST.

    "abstract": "Rotated object detection in aerial images has received increasing attention\nfor a wide range of applications. However, it is also a challenging task due to\nthe huge variations of scale, rotation, aspect ratio, and densely arranged\ntargets. Most existing methods heavily rely on a large number of pre-defined\nanchors with different scales, angles, and aspect ratios, and are optimized\nwith a distance loss. Therefore, these methods are sensitive to anchor\nhyper-parameters and easily suffer from performance degradation caused by\nboundary discontinuity. To handle this problem, in this paper, we propose a\ndense anchor-free rotated object detector (DARDet) for rotated object detection\nin aerial images. Our DARDet directly predicts five parameters of rotated boxes\nat each foreground pixel of feature maps. We design a new alignment convolution\nmodule to extracts aligned features and introduce a PIoU loss for precise and\nstable regression. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three\ncommonly used aerial objects datasets (i.e., DOTA, HRSC2016, and UCAS-AOD)\nwhile keeping high efficiency.

We apply random noise as well as unsupervised\nwavelet memory to adaptively modulate the face-enhancement generator,\nconsidering attentional denormalization in both layer and instance levels.\nSpecifically, in the training stage, the low-level spatial feature embedding,\nthe wavelet memory embedding obtained by wavelet transformation of the\nhigh-resolution image, as well as the disentangled high-level noise embeddings\nare integrated, with the guidance of attentional maps generated from layer\nnormalization, instance normalization, and the original feature map. These\nthree embeddings are respectively associated with the spatial content,\nhigh-frequency texture details, and a learnable universal prior against other\nblind image degradation patterns. We store the spatial feature of the\nlow-resolution image and the corresponding wavelet style code as key and value\nin the memory unit, respectively. In the test stage, the wavelet memory value\nwhose corresponding spatial key is the most matching with that of the inferred\nimage is retrieved to modulate the generator.

    "abstract": "Collaboration across institutional boundaries is widespread and increasing\ntoday. It depends on federations sharing data that often have governance rules\nor external regulations restricting their use. However, the handling of data\ngovernance rules (aka. data-use policies) remains manual, time-consuming and\nerror-prone, limiting the rate at which collaborations can form and respond to\nchallenges and opportunities, inhibiting citizen science and reducing data\nproviders' trust in compliance. Using an automated system to facilitate\ncompliance handling reduces substantially the time needed for such non-mission\nwork, thereby accelerating collaboration and improving productivity. We present\na framework, Dr.Aid, that helps individuals, organisations and federations\ncomply with data rules, using automation to track which rules are applicable as\ndata is passed between processes and as derived data is generated. It encodes\ndata-governance rules using a formal language and performs reasoning on\nmulti-input-multi-output data-flow graphs in decentralised contexts. We test\nits power and utility by working with users performing cyclone tracking and\nearthquake modelling to support mitigation and emergency response. We query\nstandard provenance traces to detach Dr.Aid from details of the tools and\nsystems they are using, as these inevitably vary across members of a federation\nand through time. We evaluate the model in three aspects by encoding real-life\ndata-use policies from diverse fields, showing its capability for real-world\nusage and its advantages compared with traditional frameworks. We argue that\nthis approach will lead to more agile, more productive and more trustworthy\ncollaborations and show that the approach can be adopted incrementally.

Due to the high directivity and propagation loss of THz waves, a\nmassive MIMO system using beamforming is envisioned as a promising technology\nin THz communication to realize high-gain and directional transmission.\nHowever, pilots, which are the fundamentals for many beamforming schemes, are\nchallenging to be accurately detected in the THz band owing to the severe\npropagation loss. In this paper, a unified 3D beam training and tracking\nprocedure is proposed to effectively realize the beamforming in THz\ncommunications, by considering the line-of-sight (LoS) propagation. In\nparticular, a novel quadruple-uniform planar array (QUPA) architecture is\nanalyzed to enlarge the signal coverage, increase the beam gain, and reduce the\nbeam squint loss.

The design ethos focuses on efficiency and flexibility such that\noptimization objectives, cross-layer interactions can be reconfigured rapidly.\nTo demonstrate our claims, we provide results from extensive outdoor\nover-the-air evaluation in various settings with up to 10-node network\ntypologies. The results demonstrate high reliability, throughput, and dynamic\nrouting capability achieving high technology readiness level (TRL) for tactical\napplications.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a framework for characterizing and managing active\ndistribution networks (ADNs) via flexibility area segmentation. Specifically,\nflexible active and reactive power support at the interface with transmission\nnetworks is analyzed. The framework is fundamentally different from existing\nstudies that either characterize ADN flexibility considering the full\navailability of flexible units or determine a risk-averse share of the\nflexibility area using robust optimization models. Such methods cannot provide\nsufficient information to distribution system operators (DSOs) on the structure\nof the flexibility area and reliability of its components. The proposed\nsegmentation approach relies on combinatorial optimization models and\nclassifies the ADN flexibility area's segments by the number of flexible units\nactivated and probabilities associated with units activation. The resulting\nclassification enables DSOs to analyze and manage the provision of ADNs\nflexibility services. The applicability and scalability of the proposed\nframework is illustrated based on the 33-bus and 124-bus radial distribution\nnetwork case studies.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the question of how and with what consequences anonymity\nis used as a creative element in experiments dealing with alternative forms of\nknowledge production. More specifically, the focus is on a particular current\nin contemporary dance, experimental dance. This has developed in the course of\nthe 1970s. Its guiding idea is to shift the focus away from finished\nchoreography and performance to the processuality, spontaneity, and experience\nof dance practice itself. Dance is seen as a laboratory in which to experiment\nwith gravity, body boundaries, group dynamics and perception. The focus is on\ntesting, touching, trying. The corresponding events are called either 'Dance\nLabs' or 'Movement Research Workshops', depending on the regularity. An\ninstrument that is often used in the context of such events to create specific\nsocial situations and group dynamics or to channel perceptions in certain\ndirections is anonymity. Anonymity is broadly understood as the capping of\nconnections that results in a degree of unaccountability with respect to\nvarious aspects of a person, situation, or activity. For example,\nunaccountability can arise from the fact that people can no longer see each\nother, so that visual identification becomes impossible, even if only\ntemporarily. By breaking familiar modes of identification, other forms of\nrelating can sometimes be emphasized. This is what makes this form of anonymity\nso interesting for experimental dance.",

To\nenhance the robustness of existing pre-trained models, one way is adversarial\nexamples generation and evaluation for conducting data augmentation or\nadversarial learning. In the meanwhile, gender bias embedded in the models\nseems to be a serious problem in practical applications. Many researches have\ncovered the gender bias produced by word-level information(e.g.\ngender-stereotypical occupations), while few researchers have investigated the\nsentence-level cases and implicit cases.\nIn this paper, we proposed a method to automatically generate implicit gender\nbias samples at sentence-level and a metric to measure gender bias. Samples\ngenerated by our method will be evaluated in terms of accuracy. The metric will\nbe used to guide the generation of examples from Pre-trained models. Therefore,\nthose examples could be used to impose attacks on Pre-trained Models.

However, training RL\nagents is very time consuming. Current implementations exhibit poor performance\ndue to challenges such as irregular memory accesses and synchronization\noverheads.\nIn this work, we propose a framework for generating scalable reinforcement\nlearning implementations on multicore systems. Replay Buffer is a key component\nof RL algorithms which facilitates storage of samples obtained from\nenvironmental interactions and their sampling for the learning process. We\ndefine a new data structure for prioritized replay buffer based on $K$-ary sum\ntree that supports asynchronous parallel insertions, sampling, and priority\nupdates. To address the challenge of irregular memory accesses, we propose a\nnovel data layout to store the nodes of the sum tree that reduces the number of\ncache misses. Additionally, we propose \\textit{lazy writing} mechanism to\nreduce synchronization overheads of the replay buffer. Our framework employs\nparallel actors to concurrently collect data via environmental interactions,\nand parallel learners to perform stochastic gradient descent using the\ncollected data. Our framework supports a wide range of reinforcement learning\nalgorithms including DQN, DDPG, TD3, SAC, etc. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our framework in accelerating RL algorithms by performing experiments on CPU\n+ GPU platform using OpenAI benchmarks. Our results show that the performance\nof our approach scales linearly with the number of cores. Compared with the\nbaseline approaches, we reduce the convergence time by 3.1x$\\sim$10.8x.

Such networks are\nheterogeneous in terms of computation-to-communication (CTC) ratios and\ncomputation patterns between layers, especially for different layer types. Yet,\nexisting AI processors either use homogeneous processing elements (PEs),\nresulting in low runtime PE efficiency, or run different layers on\nheterogeneous PEs in sequential, introducing resource redundancy. This paper\nproposes a heterogeneous dual-core architecture (dual-OPU), where one core is\noptimized for regular convolution layers and the other for depthwise\nconvolution layers. PEs are homogeneous with each core. To make full use of\ndual-core parallelism, we develop a scheduling algorithm to concurrently\nexecute layers for different input images on dual-core and balance parallel\nworkload.

It has been\nextensively studied regarding how to derive a safe control law with a\ncontrol-affine analytical dynamic model. However, in complex environments and\ntasks, it is challenging and time-consuming to obtain a principled analytical\nmodel of the system. In these situations, data-driven learning is extensively\nused and the learned models are encoded in neural networks.

    "title": "Decentralized Safe Reinforcement Learning for Voltage Control",
    "abstract": "Inverter-based distributed energy resources provide the possibility for fast\ntime-scale voltage control by quickly adjusting their reactive power. The\npower-electronic interfaces allow these resources to realize almost arbitrary\ncontrol law, but designing these decentralized controllers is nontrivial.\nReinforcement learning (RL) approaches are becoming increasingly popular to\nsearch for policy parameterized by neural networks. It is difficult, however,\nto enforce that the learned controllers are safe, in the sense that they may\nintroduce instabilities into the system.\nThis paper proposes a safe learning approach for voltage control. We prove\nthat the system is guaranteed to be exponentially stable if each controller\nsatisfies certain Lipschitz constraints. The set of Lipschitz bound is\noptimized to enlarge the search space for neural network controllers. We\nexplicitly engineer the structure of neural network controllers such that they\nsatisfy the Lipschitz constraints by design. A decentralized RL framework is\nconstructed to train local neural network controller at each bus in a\nmodel-free setting.",

    "abstract": "Here, we develop a deep learning algorithm for solving Principal-Agent (PA)\nmean field games with market-clearing conditions -- a class of problems that\nhave thus far not been studied and one that poses difficulties for standard\nnumerical methods. We use an actor-critic approach to optimization, where the\nagents form a Nash equilibria according to the principal's penalty function,\nand the principal evaluates the resulting equilibria. The inner problem's Nash\nequilibria is obtained using a variant of the deep backward stochastic\ndifferential equation (BSDE) method modified for McKean-Vlasov forward-backward\nSDEs that includes dependence on the distribution over both the forward and\nbackward processes. The outer problem's loss is further approximated by a\nneural net by sampling over the space of penalty functions. We apply our\napproach to a stylized PA problem arising in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC)\nmarkets, where agents may rent clean energy production capacity, trade RECs,\nand expand their long-term capacity to navigate the market at maximum profit.\nOur numerical results illustrate the efficacy of the algorithm and lead to\ninteresting insights into the nature of optimal PA interactions in the\nmean-field limit of these markets.",

In this\npaper, we disentangle super-net training from the search algorithm, isolate 14\nfrequently-used training heuristics, and evaluate them over three benchmark\nsearch spaces. Our analysis uncovers that several commonly-used heuristics\nnegatively impact the correlation between super-net and stand-alone\nperformance, whereas simple, but often overlooked factors, such as proper\nhyper-parameter settings, are key to achieve strong performance.

To solve this\nchallenge, healthcare objectives associated with healthcare management\nactivities can be indirectly observed in EHRs as latent topics. Topic models,\nsuch as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), are used to identify latent patterns\nin EHR data. However, they do not examine the ordered nature of EHR sequences,\nnor do they appraise individual events in isolation. Our novel approach, the\nCategorical Sequence Encoder (CaSE) addresses these shortcomings. The\nsequential nature of EHRs is captured by CaSE's event-level representations,\nrevealing latent healthcare objectives.

    "abstract": "The traditional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is constrained by\nthe Courant-Friedrich-Levy (CFL) condition and suffers from the notorious\nstaircase error in electromagnetic simulations. This paper proposes a\nthree-dimensional conformal locally-one-dimensional FDTD (CLOD-FDTD) method to\naddress the two issues for modeling perfectly electrical conducting (PEC)\nobjects. By considering the partially filled cells, the proposed CLOD-FDTD\nmethod can significantly improve the accuracy compared with the traditional\nLOD-FDTD method and the FDTD method. At the same time, the proposed method\npreserves unconditional stability, which is analyzed and numerically validated\nusing the Von-Neuman method. Significant gains in CPU time are achieved by\nusing large time steps without sacrificing accuracy. The accuracy and\nefficiency of the proposed method are validated through two numerical examples.",

Our\nmetric, Neighbor Distribution Divergence (NDD), evaluates the disturbance on\npredicted distribution of neighboring words from mask language model (MLM). NDD\nis capable of detecting precise changes in semantics which are easily ignored\nby text similarity. By exploiting the property of NDD, we implement a\nunsupervised and even training-free algorithm for extractive sentence\ncompression. We show that our NDD-based algorithm outperforms previous\nperplexity-based unsupervised algorithm by a large margin.

    "abstract": "Bimodal palmprint recognition leverages palmprint and palm vein images\nsimultaneously,which achieves high accuracy by multi-model information fusion\nand has strong anti-falsification property. In the recognition pipeline, the\ndetection of palm and the alignment of region-of-interest (ROI) are two crucial\nsteps for accurate matching. Most existing methods localize palm ROI by\nkeypoint detection algorithms, however the intrinsic difficulties of keypoint\ndetection tasks make the results unsatisfactory. Besides, the ROI alignment and\nfusion algorithms at image-level are not fully investigaged.To bridge the gap,\nin this paper, we propose Bimodal Palmprint Fusion Network (BPFNet) which\nfocuses on ROI localization, alignment and bimodal image fusion.BPFNet is an\nend-to-end framework containing two subnets: The detection network directly\nregresses the palmprint ROIs based on bounding box prediction and conducts\nalignment by translation estimation.In the downstream,the bimodal fusion\nnetwork implements bimodal ROI image fusion leveraging a novel proposed\ncross-modal selection scheme. To show the effectiveness of BPFNet,we carry out\nexperiments on the large-scale touchless palmprint datasets CUHKSZ-v1 and\nTongJi and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances.",

    "abstract": "Modern CAD tools represent 3D designs not only as geometry, but also as a\nprogram composed of geometric operations, each of which depends on a set of\nparameters. Program representations enable meaningful and controlled shape\nvariations via parameter changes. However, achieving desired modifications\nsolely through parameter editing is challenging when CAD models have not been\nexplicitly authored to expose select degrees of freedom in advance. We\nintroduce a novel bidirectional editing system for 3D CAD programs. In addition\nto editing the CAD program, users can directly manipulate 3D geometry and our\nsystem infers parameter updates to keep both representations in sync. We\nformulate inverse edits as a set of constrained optimization objectives,\nreturning plausible updates to program parameters that both match user intent\nand maintain program validity. Our approach implements an automatically\ndifferentiable domain-specific language for CAD programs, providing derivatives\nfor this optimization to be performed quickly on any expressed program. Our\nsystem enables rapid, interactive exploration of a constrained 3D design space\nby allowing users to manipulate the program and geometry interchangeably during\ndesign iteration. While our approach is not designed to optimize across changes\nin geometric topology, we show it is expressive and performant enough for users\nto produce a diverse set of design variants, even when the CAD program contains\na large number of parameters.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the kinds of visual media US national politicians\nshare on Twitter, how a politician's use of these various types of imagery\nreflects their political position, and identifies a hazard in using standard\nmethods for image characterization in assessing political visual media. While\npast work has yielded useful results in investigating politicians' use of\nimagery in social media spaces, that work has focused primarily on photographic\nmedia, which may not be sufficient given the variety of visual media shared in\nsuch spaces (e.g., infographics, illustrations, or memes). This work instead\nuses clustering to characterize eight broad types of visual media US national\npoliticians share in Twitter, where we find most politicians share a variety of\ntypes of imagery. Using three popular deep learning models to characterize\nimagery, results also show that how a politician distributes their imagery\nacross these clusters is correlated with their overall ideological position. A\nqualitative assessment of these images reveals regularities among imagery used\nby liberal and conservative politicians, where conservative politicians tend to\nshare patriotic imagery while liberals tend to share information-laden imagery.\nThis analysis also reveals that all three image characterization models group\nimages with vastly different semantic meaning into the same clusters, as\nconfirmed in a post-hoc analysis of hateful memetic imagery. These results\nsuggest that, while image-characterization techniques do identify general types\nof imagery that are correlated with political ideology, these methods miss\ncritical semantic and politically relevant differences among images.\nConsequently, care should be taken when dealing with different varieties of\nimagery shared in online spaces.",

The modification involves\nsupplementing axial-attention modules with quaternion input representations to\nimprove image classification accuracy. We chose axial-attention networks\nbecause they factor 2D attention operations into two consecutive 1D operations\n(similar to separable convolution) and are thus less resource intensive than\nnon-axial attention networks. We chose a quaternion encoder because of they\nshare weights across four real-valued input channels and the weight-sharing has\nbeen shown to produce a more interlinked/interwoven output representation. We\nhypothesize that an attention module can be more effective using these\ninterlinked representations as input.

No large scale publicly available\nannotated datasets of Indian legal documents exist till date. This limits the\nscope for legal analytics research. In this work, we propose a new dataset\nconsisting of over 10,000 judgements delivered by the supreme court of India\nand their corresponding hand written summaries. The proposed dataset is\npre-processed by normalising common legal abbreviations, handling spelling\nvariations in named entities, handling bad punctuations and accurate sentence\ntokenization. Each sentence is tagged with their rhetorical roles. We also\nannotate each judgement with several attributes like date, names of the\nplaintiffs, defendants and the people representing them, judges who delivered\nthe judgement, acts/statutes that are cited and the most common citations used\nto refer the judgement. Further, we propose an automatic labelling technique\nfor identifying sentences which have summary worthy information. We demonstrate\nthat this auto labeled data can be used effectively to train a weakly\nsupervised sentence extractor with high accuracy.

The purpose of the VPMN is to hide the position of the VPMN\nUEs to the mobile network operator (MNO). We investigate the design and\nperformance of packet routing inside the VPMN. First, we note that the routing\nthat maximizes the rate between the VPMN and the cellular network leads to an\nunbalanced use of the gateways by each UE. In turn, this reveals information on\nthe location of the VPMN UEs. Therefore, we derive a routing algorithm that\nmaximizes the VPMN rate, while imposing for each UE the same data rate at each\ngateway, thus hiding the location of the UE. We compare the performance of the\nresulting solution, assessing the location privacy achieved by the VPMN, and\nconsidering both the case of single hop and multihop in the transmissions from\nthe UEs to the gateways.",

As a result, such drawbacks make the existing attacks more\nnoticeable to users and corresponding fingerprinting detection mechanisms. In\nresponse, in this work, we propose Leaked-Web, a novel accurate and efficient\nmachine learning-based website fingerprinting attack through processor's\nHardware Performance Counters (HPCs). Leaked-Web efficiently collects hardware\nperformance counters in users' computer systems at a significantly low\ngranularity monitoring rate and sends the samples to the remote attack's server\nfor further classification. Leaked-Web examines the web browsers'\nmicroarchitectural features using various advanced machine learning algorithms\nranging from classical, boosting, deep learning, and time-series models. Our\nexperimental results indicate that Leaked-Web based on a LogitBoost ML\nclassifier using only the top 4 HPC features achieves 91% classification\naccuracy outperforming the state-of-the-art attacks by nearly 5%.

This paper aims to bring the \"control design\" idea into the\nmathematics by providing an observer-based iterative method that focuses on\nsolving linear algebraic equations (LAEs). An inherent relationship is revealed\nbetween the problem-solving of LAEs and the design of observer-based control\nsystems, with which the iterative method for solving LAEs is exploited based on\nthe design of the basic state observers. It is shown that all (least squares)\nsolutions for any (un)solvable LAEs can be determined exponentially fast or\nmonotonically with different selections of initial conditions. By integrating\nthe design idea of the deadbeat control, the solving of LAEs can be achieved\nwithin only finite iterations. In particular, our proposed iterative method can\nbe leveraged to develop a new observer-based design algorithm to realize the\nperfect tracking objective of conventional two-dimensional iterative learning\ncontrol (ILC) systems, where the gap between classical ILC design and popular\nfeedback-based control design is narrowed.",

First, we propose a novel Gain Cell (GC) design\nusing FDSOI. The GC has several desirable characteristics, including ~50%\nhigher storage density and ~50% lower dynamic energy as compared to the\ntraditional 6T SRAM, even after accounting for peripheral circuit overheads. We\nalso exploit back-gate bias to increase retention time to 1.12 ms (~60x of\neDRAM) which, combined with optimizations like staggered refresh, makes it an\nideal candidate to architect all levels of on-chip caches. We show that\ncompared to 6T SRAM, for a given area budget, GC based caches, on average,\nprovide 29% and 36% increase in IPC for single- and multi-programmed workloads,\nrespectively on contemporary workloads including SPEC CPU2017. We also observe\ndynamic energy savings of 42% and 34% for single- and multi-programmed\nworkloads, respectively.\nWe utilize the inherent properties of the proposed GC, including decoupled\nread and write bitlines to devise optimizations to save precharge energy and\narchitect GC caches with better energy and performance characteristics.\nFinally, in a quest to utilize the best of all worlds, we combine GC with\nSTT-RAM to create hybrid hierarchies. We show that a hybrid hierarchy with GC\ncaches at L1 and L2, and an LLC split between GC and STT-RAM, with asymmetric\nwrite optimization enabled, is able to provide a 54% benefit in energy-delay\nproduct (EDP) as compared to an all-SRAM design, and 13% as compared to an\nall-GC cache hierarchy, averaged across multi-programmed workloads.",

    "abstract": "To induce a desired equilibrium in a social system comprised of\nself-interested agents, economic incentives (e.g., taxes, tolls, and subsidies)\nare often required to correct an inefficient outcome. Such an incentive design\nproblem naturally possesses a bi-level structure, in which an upper-level\n\"designer\" revises the payoffs of the agents with incentives while anticipating\nthe response of the agents, who play a non-cooperative game at the lower level.\nThe existing bi-level optimization algorithms developed in machine learning\nraise a dilemma when applied to this problem: anticipating how incentives\naffect the agents at equilibrium requires solving the equilibrium problem\nrepeatedly, which is computationally inefficient; bypassing the time-consuming\nstep of equilibrium-finding can reduce the computational cost, but may lead to\na sub-optimal solution. Therefore, we propose an efficient method that tackles\nthe designer's and agents' problems simultaneously in a single loop. At each\niteration, both the designer and the agents only move one step based on the\nfirst-order information. In the proposed scheme, although the designer does not\nsolve the equilibrium problem repeatedly, it can anticipate the overall\ninfluence of the incentives on the agents, which guarantees optimality.

    "abstract": "Automatic detection of relevant groups of nodes in large real-world graphs,\ni.e. community detection, has applications in many fields and has received a\nlot of attention in the last twenty years. The most popular method designed to\nfind overlapping communities (where a node can belong to several communities)\nis perhaps the clique percolation method (CPM). This method formalizes the\nnotion of community as a maximal union of $k$-cliques that can be reached from\neach other through a series of adjacent $k$-cliques, where two cliques are\nadjacent if and only if they overlap on $k-1$ nodes. Despite much effort CPM\nhas not been scalable to large graphs for medium values of $k$.\nRecent work has shown that it is possible to efficiently list all $k$-cliques\nin very large real-world graphs for medium values of $k$. We build on top of\nthis work and scale up CPM. In cases where this first algorithm faces memory\nlimitations, we propose another algorithm, CPMZ, that provides a solution close\nto the exact one, using more time but less memory.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing penetration of converter-interfaced distributed\ngeneration systems, it would be advantageous to specify local compliance\ncriteria for these devices to ensure the small-signal stability of the\ninterconnected system. Passivity of the device admittance, which is an example\nof a local criterion, has been used previously to avoid resonances between\nthese devices and the lightly damped oscillatory modes of the network. Typical\nactive and reactive power control strategies like droop control and virtual\nsynchronous generator control inherently violate the passivity constraints on\nadmittance at low frequencies, although this does not necessarily mean that the\ninterconnected system will be unstable. Therefore, passivity of the admittance\nis unsuitable as a stability criterion for devices that are represented by\ntheir wide-band models. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes the use\nof criteria based on admittance at higher frequencies and an alternative\ntransfer function at lower frequencies. The alternative representation uses\nactive and reactive power and the derivatives of the polar components of\nvoltage as interface variables. To allow for the separate analysis at low and\nhigh frequencies, the device dynamics should exhibit a slow-fast separation;\nthis is proposed as an additional constraint. Adherence to the proposed\ncriteria is not onerous and is easily verifiable through frequency response\nanalysis.",

Trusted execution environments (TEEs) have\nemerged as a promising solution to enable privacy-preserving inference and\ntraining. TEEs, however, have limited memory and computation resources which\nrenders it not comparable to untrusted parallel hardware in performance. To\nmitigate the trade-off between privacy and computing performance, we propose an\nasymmetric model decomposition framework, AsymML, to (1) accelerate\ntraining/inference using parallel hardware; and (2) preserve privacy using\nTEEs. By exploiting the low-rank characteristics in data and intermediate\nfeatures, AsymML asymmetrically splits a DNN model into trusted and untrusted\nparts: the trusted part features privacy-sensitive data but incurs small\ncompute/memory costs; while the untrusted part is computationally-intensive but\nnot privacy-sensitive. Computing performance and privacy are guaranteed by\nrespectively delegating the trusted and untrusted part to TEEs and GPUs.\nFurthermore, we present a theoretical rank bound analysis showing that low-rank\ncharacteristics are still preserved in intermediate features, which guarantees\nefficiency of AsymML.

In this paper, we propose\n\"Spatial Ensemble\", a novel model smoothing mechanism in parallel with TMA.\nSpatial Ensemble randomly picks up a small fragment of the student model to\ndirectly replace the corresponding fragment of the teacher model.\nConsequentially, it stitches different fragments of historical student models\ninto a unity, yielding the \"Spatial Ensemble\" effect. Spatial Ensemble obtains\ncomparable student-teacher learning performance by itself and demonstrates\nvaluable complementarity with temporal moving average.

Several prior studies address this\nissue by expanding the distribution of the limited training data via massive\nand hand-crafted data augmentation. We handle data-limited image generation\nfrom a very different perspective. Specifically, we design GenCo, a Generative\nCo-training network that mitigates the discriminator over-fitting issue by\nintroducing multiple complementary discriminators that provide diverse\nsupervision from multiple distinctive views in training. We instantiate the\nidea of GenCo in two ways. The first way is Weight-Discrepancy Co-training\n(WeCo) which co-trains multiple distinctive discriminators by diversifying\ntheir parameters. The second way is Data-Discrepancy Co-training (DaCo) which\nachieves co-training by feeding discriminators with different views of the\ninput images (e.g., different frequency components of the input images).\nExtensive experiments over multiple benchmarks show that GenCo achieves\nsuperior generation with limited training data. In addition, GenCo also\ncomplements the augmentation approach with consistent and clear performance\ngains when combined.",

However, achieving these\ngoals simultaneously is challenging, and most advanced approaches only focus on\nparts of them. Towards an overall consideration of these aspects, we propose a\nnovel clustering algorithm, namely GIT (Clustering Based on \\textbf{G}raph of\n\\textbf{I}ntensity \\textbf{T}opology). GIT considers both local and global data\nstructures: firstly forming local clusters based on intensity peaks of samples,\nand then estimating the global topological graph (topo-graph) between these\nlocal clusters. We use the Wasserstein Distance between the predicted and prior\nclass proportions to automatically cut noisy edges in the topo-graph and merge\nconnected local clusters as final clusters. Then, we compare GIT with seven\ncompeting algorithms on five synthetic datasets and nine real-world datasets.\nWith fast local cluster detection, robust topo-graph construction and accurate\nedge-cutting, GIT shows attractive ARISE performance and significantly exceeds\nother non-convex clustering methods. For example, GIT outperforms its\ncounterparts about $10\\%$ (F1-score) on MNIST and FashionMNIST. Code is\navailable at \\color{red}{https://github.com/gaozhangyang/GIT}.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing multi-way measurements with variations across one mode of the\ndataset is a challenge in various fields including data mining, neuroscience\nand chemometrics. For example, measurements may evolve over time or have\nunaligned time profiles. The PARAFAC2 model has been successfully used to\nanalyze such data by allowing the underlying factor matrices in one mode (i.e.,\nthe evolving mode) to change across slices. The traditional approach to fit a\nPARAFAC2 model is to use an alternating least squares-based algorithm, which\nhandles the constant cross-product constraint of the PARAFAC2 model by\nimplicitly estimating the evolving factor matrices. This approach makes\nimposing regularization on these factor matrices challenging. There is\ncurrently no algorithm to flexibly impose such regularization with general\npenalty functions and hard constraints. In order to address this challenge and\nto avoid the implicit estimation, in this paper, we propose an algorithm for\nfitting PARAFAC2 based on alternating optimization with the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (AO-ADMM). With numerical experiments on\nsimulated data, we show that the proposed PARAFAC2 AO-ADMM approach allows for\nflexible constraints, recovers the underlying patterns accurately, and is\ncomputationally efficient compared to the state-of-the-art.

In this work, we study the\nparadigm of Active graph SLAM formulated over $\\textit{SE(n)}$, and propose a\ngeneral relationship between the full FIM and the Laplacian matrix of the\nunderlying pose-graph. Therefore, the optimal set of actions can be estimated\nby maximizing optimality criteria of the weighted Laplacian instead of that of\nthe FIM. Experimental validation proves our method leads to equivalent results\nin a fraction of the time traditional methods require. Based on the former, we\npresent an online Active graph SLAM system capable of selecting D-optimal\nactions and that outperforms other state-of-the-art methods that rely on slower\ncomputations. Also, we propose the use of such indices as stopping criterion,\nmaking our system capable of autonomously determining when the exploration\nstrategy is no longer adding information to the graph SLAM algorithm and it\nshould be either changed or terminated.",

Previous research investigated catastrophic\nforgetting in fully connected networks, with some earlier work exploring\nactivation functions and learning algorithms. Applications of neural networks\nhave been extended to include similarity and metric learning. It is of\nsignificant interest to understand how metric learning loss functions would be\naffected by catastrophic forgetting. Our research investigates catastrophic\nforgetting for four well-known metric-based loss functions during incremental\nclass learning. The loss functions are angular, contrastive, centre, and\ntriplet loss. Our results show that the rate of catastrophic forgetting is\ndifferent across loss functions on multiple datasets. The angular loss was\nleast affected, followed by contrastive, triplet loss, and centre loss with\ngood mining techniques. We implemented three existing incremental learning\ntechniques, iCARL, EWC, and EBLL. We further proposed our novel technique using\nVAEs to generate representation as exemplars that are passed through\nintermediate layers of the network. Our method outperformed the three existing\ntechniques. We have shown that we do not require stored images as exemplars for\nincremental learning with similarity learning.

As RL becomes ubiquitous and used in\ncritical and general public applications, it is essential to develop methods\nthat make it better understood and more interpretable. This study proposes a\nnovel approach to explain cooperative strategies in multiagent RL using Shapley\nvalues, a game theory concept used in XAI that successfully explains the\nrationale behind decisions taken by Machine Learning algorithms. Through\ntesting common assumptions of this technique in two cooperation-centered\nsocially challenging multi-agent environments environments, this article argues\nthat Shapley values are a pertinent way to evaluate the contribution of players\nin a cooperative multi-agent RL context. To palliate the high overhead of this\nmethod, Shapley values are approximated using Monte Carlo sampling.\nExperimental results on Multiagent Particle and Sequential Social Dilemmas show\nthat Shapley values succeed at estimating the contribution of each agent. These\nresults could have implications that go beyond games in economics, (e.g., for\nnon-discriminatory decision making, ethical and responsible AI-derived\ndecisions or policy making under fairness constraints). They also expose how\nShapley values only give general explanations about a model and cannot explain\na single run, episode nor justify precise actions taken by agents.

However, Australian farms are large meaning that many of Australia's\nlivestock are unmonitored which impacts farm profit, animal welfare and the\nenvironment. Effective animal localisation and counting by analysing satellite\nimagery overcomes this management hurdle however, high resolution satellite\nimagery is expensive. Thus, to minimise cost the lowest spatial resolution data\nthat enables accurate livestock detection should be selected. In our work, we\ndetermine the association between object detector performance and spatial\ndegradation for cattle, sheep and dogs. Accurate ground truth was established\nusing high resolution drone images which were then downsampled to various\nground sample distances (GSDs). Both circular and cassegrain aperture optics\nwere simulated to generate point spread functions (PSFs) corresponding to\nvarious optical qualities. By simulating the PSF, rather than approximating it\nas a Gaussian, the images were accurately degraded to match the spatial\nresolution and blurring structure of satellite imagery.\nTwo existing datasets were combined and used to train and test a YoloV5\nobject detection network. Detector performance was found to drop steeply around\na GSD of 0.5m/px and was associated with PSF matrix structure within this GSD\nregion. Detector mAP performance fell by 52 percent when a cassegrain, rather\nthan circular, aperture was used at a 0.5m/px GSD.

    "abstract": "Most of the existing mapped WENO schemes suffer from either losing high\nresolutions or generating spurious oscillations in long-run simulations of\nhyperbolic problems. The purpose of this paper is to amend this commonly\nreported issue. We firstly present the definition of the locally\norder-preserving (LOP) mapping. Then, by using a new proposed posteriori\nadaptive technique, we apply this LOP property to obtain the new mappings from\nthose of the WENO-X schemes where \"X\" stands for the version of the existing\nmapped WENO scheme. The essential idea of the posteriori adaptive technique is\nto identify the global stencil in which the existing mappings fail to preserve\nthe LOP property, and then replace the mapped weights with the weights of the\nclassic WENO-JS scheme to recover the LOP property. We build the resultant\nmapped WENO schemes and denote them as PoAOP-WENO-X. The numerical results of\nthe 1D linear advection problem with different initial conditions and some\nstandard 2D problems modeled via Euler equations, calculated by the\nPoAOP-WENO-X schemes, are compared with the ones generated by their non-OP\ncounterparts and the WENO-JS scheme. In summary, the PoAOP-WENO-X schemes enjoy\ngreat advantages in terms of attaining high resolutions and in the meantime\npreventing spurious oscillations near discontinuities when solving the\none-dimensional linear advection problems with long output times, and\nsignificantly reducing the post-shock oscillations in the simulations of the\ntwo-dimensional problems with shock waves.",

Still, one can reduce the\ncost by representing the evolving particle density function in terms of its\nmoments.

QBMMs\nhave been shown to accurately model sprays and soot with a relatively compact\nset of moments. However, significantly non-Gaussian processes such as bubble\ndynamics lead to numerical instabilities when extending their moment sets\naccordingly. We solve this problem by training a recurrent neural network (RNN)\nthat adjusts the QBMM quadrature to evaluate unclosed moments with higher\naccuracy. The proposed method is tested on a simple model of bubbles\noscillating in response to a temporally fluctuating pressure field. The\napproach decreases model-form error by a factor of 10 when compared to\ntraditional QBMMs. It is both numerically stable and computationally efficient\nsince it does not expand the baseline moment set.

One promising approach is to learn deep grasping models\nfrom training datasets of object images and grasp labels. Approaches in this\ncategory require millions of data to train deep models. However, empirical\ngrasping datasets typically consist of sparsely labeled samples (i.e., a\nlimited number of successful grasp labels in each image). This paper proposes a\nMaximum Likelihood Grasp Sampling Loss (MLGSL) to tackle the data sparsity\nissue. The proposed method supposes that successful grasp labels are sampled\nfrom a ground-truth grasp distribution and aims to recover the ground-truth\nmap. MLGSL is utilized for training a fully convolutional network that detects\nthousands of grasps simultaneously. Training results suggest that models based\non MLGSL can learn to grasp with datasets composing of 2 labels per image,\nwhich implies that it is 8x more data-efficient than current state-of-the-art\ntechniques.

Autonomic anomaly detection (e.g., malfunctioning\nmachines and hazard situations) in a factory hall is on the list and expects to\nbe realized with massive IoT sensor deployments. In this paper, we consider\nacoustic data-based anomaly detection, which is widely used in factories\nbecause sound information reflects richer internal states while videos cannot;\nbesides, the capital investment of an audio system is more economically\nfriendly. However, a unique challenge of using audio data is that sounds are\nmixed when collecting thus source data separation is inevitable.

We demonstrate\nthat this job can be transformed into an in-network processing scheme and thus\nfurther accelerated. Specifically, we propose a progressive processing scheme\nwhere data separation jobs are distributed as microservices on intermediate\nnodes in parallel with data forwarding.

For underwater exploration,\nimage mosaicing has proved to be a valid and effective approach to visualize\nlarge mapped areas, often employed in conjunction with autonomous underwater\nvehicles (AUVs) and ROVs.

In this work, we present SAGS, a\nnovel Simulated Annealing framework for Graph and Sequence optimization. The\nkey idea is to integrate powerful neural networks into metaheuristics (e.g.,\nsimulated annealing, SA) to restrict the search space in discrete optimization.\nWe start by defining a sophisticated objective function, involving the property\nof interest and pre-defined constraints (e.g., grammar validity). SAGS searches\nfrom the discrete space towards this objective by performing a sequence of\nlocal edits, where deep generative neural networks propose the editing content\nand thus can control the quality of editing. We evaluate SAGS on paraphrase\ngeneration and molecule generation for sequence optimization and graph\noptimization, respectively. Extensive results show that our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance compared with existing paraphrase generation\nmethods in terms of both automatic and human evaluations. Further, SAGS also\nsignificantly outperforms all the previous methods in molecule generation.",

    "abstract": "Photovoltaics (PV) have achieved rapid development in the past decade in\nterms of power conversion efficiency of lab-scale small-area devices; however,\nsuccessful commercialization still requires further development of low-cost,\nscalable, and high-throughput manufacturing techniques. One of the key\nchallenges to the development of a new fabrication technique is the\nhigh-dimensional parameter space, and machine learning (ML) can be used to\naccelerate perovskite PV scaling. Here, we present an ML framework of\nsequential learning for manufacturing process optimization. We apply our\nmethodology to the Rapid Spray Plasma Processing (RSPP) technique for\nperovskite thin films in ambient conditions. With a limited experimental budget\nof screening 100 conditions process conditions, we demonstrated an efficiency\nimprovement to 18.5% for the best performing device, and found 10 conditions to\nproduce the top-performing devices of higher than 17% efficiency. Our model is\nenabled by three innovations: (a) flexible knowledge transfer between\nexperimental processes by incorporating data from prior experimental data as a\nsoft constraint; (b) incorporation of both subjective human observations and ML\ninsights when selecting next experiments; (c) adaptive strategy of locating the\nregion of interest using Bayesian optimization first, and then conducting local\nexploration for high-efficiency devices. In virtual benchmarking, our framework\nachieves faster improvements with limited experimental budgets than traditional\ndesign-of-experiments methods (e.g., one-variable-at-a-time sampling). In\naddition, this framework is shown to enable researchers' domain knowledge in\nthe ML-guided optimization loop; therefore, it has the potential to facilitate\nthe wider adoption of ML in scaling to perovskite PV manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies anonymous and confidential genomic case and control\ncomputing within the federated framework leveraging SPDZ. Our contribution\nmainly comprises the following three-fold:\n\\begin{itemize} \\item In the first fold, an efficient construction of Beaver\ntriple generators (BTGs) formalized in the 3-party computation leveraging\nmultiplicatively homomorphic key management protocols (mHKMs) is presented and\nanalysed. Interestingly, we are able to show the equivalence between BTGs and\nmHKMs. We then propose a lightweight construction of BTGs, and show that our\nconstruction is secure against semi-honest adversary if the underlying\nmultiplicatively homomorphic encryption is semantically secure.\n\\item In the second fold, a decoupling model for SPDZ with explicit\nseparation of BTGs from MPC servers (MPCs) is introduced and formalized, where\nBTGs aim to generate the Beaver triples while MPCs to process the input data. A\nnew notion, which we call blind triple dispensation protocol, is then\nintroduced for securely dispensing the generated Beaver triples, and\nconstructed from mHKMs. We demonstrate the power of mHKMs by showing that it is\na useful notion not only for generating Beaver triples but also for securely\ndispensing triples as well.\n\\item In the third-fold, a lightweight genomic case and control computing\nmodel is proposed, which reaches the anonymity and confidentiality\nsimultaneously. An efficient truncation algorithm leveraging the depicted BTGs\nabove is then proposed by eliminating computational cost heavy PRandBitL() and\nPRandInt() protocols involved in the state-of-the-art solutions and thus\nlargely benefits us computing residual vectors for industrial scale deployment.",

    "abstract": "Temporal graphs are structures which model relational data between entities\nthat change over time. Due to the complex structure of data, mining\nstatistically significant temporal subgraphs, also known as temporal motifs, is\na challenging task. In this work, we present an efficient technique for\nextracting temporal motifs in temporal networks. Our method is based on the\nnovel notion of egocentric temporal neighborhoods, namely multi-layer\nstructures centered on an ego node. Each temporal layer of the structure\nconsists of the first-order neighborhood of the ego node, and corresponding\nnodes in sequential layers are connected by an edge. The strength of this\napproach lies in the possibility of encoding these structures into a unique bit\nvector, thus bypassing the problem of graph isomorphism in searching for\ntemporal motifs. This allows our algorithm to mine substantially larger motifs\nwith respect to alternative approaches. Furthermore, by bringing the focus on\nthe temporal dynamics of the interactions of a specific node, our model allows\nto mine temporal motifs which are visibly interpretable. Experiments on a\nnumber of complex networks of social interactions confirm the advantage of the\nproposed approach over alternative non-egocentric solutions. The egocentric\nprocedure is indeed more efficient in revealing similarities and discrepancies\namong different social environments, independently of the different\ntechnologies used to collect data, which instead affect standard non-egocentric\nmeasures.",

However, due to the sparsity of mobility data, it is\nnot an easy task to predict future POIs (place-of-interests) that are going to\nbe visited. In this paper, we propose MobTCast, a Transformer-based\ncontext-aware network for mobility prediction. Specifically, we explore the\ninfluence of four types of context in the mobility prediction: temporal,\nsemantic, social and geographical contexts. We first design a base mobility\nfeature extractor using the Transformer architecture, which takes both the\nhistory POI sequence and the semantic information as input. It handles both the\ntemporal and semantic contexts. Based on the base extractor and the social\nconnections of a user, we employ a self-attention module to model the influence\nof the social context. Furthermore, unlike existing methods, we introduce a\nlocation prediction branch in MobTCast as an auxiliary task to model the\ngeographical context and predict the next location. Intuitively, the\ngeographical distance between the location of the predicted POI and the\npredicted location from the auxiliary branch should be as close as possible. To\nreflect this relation, we design a consistency loss to further improve the POI\nprediction performance. In our experimental results, MobTCast outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art next POI prediction methods.

Updated output values are used as inputs for\ncomputations in current or subsequent iterations; hence the number of\niterations required for values to converge can potentially reduce if the newest\nvalues are asynchronously made available to other updates computed in the same\niteration. In a multi-threaded shared memory system, the immediate propagation\nof updated values can cause memory contention that may offset the benefit of\npropagating updates sooner. In some cases, the benefit of a smaller number of\niterations may be diminished by each iteration taking longer. Our key idea is\nto combine the low memory contention that synchronous approaches have with the\nfaster information sharing of asynchronous approaches.

    "abstract": "Mobile embedded devices of the Internet of Things (IoT) face tight resource\nconstraints and uncertain environments, including energy scarcity and unstable\nconnectivity. This aggravates debugging, optimization, monitoring, etc.; for\nwhich logging information must be accessible throughout all phases of\ndevelopment and product life cycles. This work compares approaches for\ntransmitting logs with regard to application requirements (e.g., bandwidth),\nresource consumption (e.g., memory), operating constraints (e.g., power\nsupply), and the medium (e.g., UART, WiFi). A qualitative comparison suggests\nthat the adequacy of approaches depends on the concrete application and the\nphase in the life cycle. We report from our case study, where the embedded\nmobile device is represented by a self-driving slot car (Carrera D132). With\nthis target device, failure logs, new firmware, and monitoring data need to be\nexchanged. The gathered experiences support our qualitative discussion:\nWireless techniques can suit the needs of many phases in the life cycle but it\nis particularly evident that energy consumption is crucial. With a loaded\nwireless stack and while transmitting logs, the car's operating voltage drop\nwithin a \\~ 20 ms power interruption is \\~ 1.6 times higher.

The spectral\nembedding of the columns suggested that questions related to physical\nactivities form a separate group. The application of the nSBM approach,\ncorroborated with that and allowed complementary findings about the modular\nstructure: some groups of questions showed a high adherence with the divisions\nqualitatively defined by the designers of the survey. However, questions from\nthe class \\textit{Safety} were partly grouped by our method in the class\n\\textit{Drugs}.

    "abstract": "In order to robustly deploy object detectors across a wide range of\nscenarios, they should be adaptable to shifts in the input distribution without\nthe need to constantly annotate new data. This has motivated research in\nUnsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) algorithms for detection. UDA methods\nlearn to adapt from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, by\ninducing alignment between detector features from source and target domains.\nYet, there is no consensus on what features to align and how to do the\nalignment. In our work, we propose a framework that generalizes the different\ncomponents commonly used by UDA methods laying the ground for an in-depth\nanalysis of the UDA design space. Specifically, we propose a novel UDA\nalgorithm, ViSGA, a direct implementation of our framework, that leverages the\nbest design choices and introduces a simple but effective method to aggregate\nfeatures at instance-level based on visual similarity before inducing group\nalignment via adversarial training. We show that both similarity-based grouping\nand adversarial training allows our model to focus on coarsely aligning feature\ngroups, without being forced to match all instances across loosely aligned\ndomains. Finally, we examine the applicability of ViSGA to the setting where\nlabeled data are gathered from different sources.

Existing methods mainly learn\ninput feature representations with invariant marginal distribution, while the\ninvariance of the conditional distribution is more essential for unknown domain\ngeneralization. This paper proposes an instrumental variable-based approach to\nlearn the domain-invariant relationship between input features and labels\ncontained in the conditional distribution. Interestingly, with a causal view on\nthe data generating process, we find that the input features of one domain are\nvalid instrumental variables for other domains. Inspired by this finding, we\ndesign a simple yet effective framework to learn the Domain-invariant\nRelationship with Instrumental VariablE (DRIVE) via a two-stage IV method.\nSpecifically, it first learns the conditional distribution of input features of\none domain given input features of another domain, and then it estimates the\ndomain-invariant relationship by predicting labels with the learned conditional\ndistribution. Simulation experiments show the proposed method accurately\ncaptures the domain-invariant relationship.

    "abstract": "Proving secure compilation of partial programs typically requires\nback-translating a target attack against the compiled program to an attack\nagainst the source program. To prove this back-translation step, one can\nsyntactically translate the target attacker to a source one -- i.e.,\nsyntax-directed back-translation -- or show that the interaction traces of the\ntarget attacker can also be produced by source attackers -- i.e.,\ntrace-directed back-translation.\nSyntax-directed back-translation is not suitable when the target attacker\nuses unstructured control flow that the source language cannot directly\nrepresent. Trace-directed back-translation works with such syntactic\ndissimilarity because only the external interactions of the target attacker\nhave to be mimicked in the source, not its internal control flow. Revealing\nonly external interactions is, however, inconvenient when sharing memory via\nunforgeable pointers, since information about stashed pointers to shared memory\ngets lost. This made prior proofs complex, since the generated attacker had to\nstash all reachable pointers.\nIn this work, we introduce more informative data-flow traces, which allow us\nto combine the best of syntax-directed and trace-directed back-translation. Our\ndata-flow back-translation is simple, handles both syntactic dissimilarity and\nmemory sharing well, and we have proved it correct in Coq.\nWe, moreover, develop a novel turn-taking simulation relation and use it to\nprove a recomposition lemma, which is key to reusing compiler correctness in\nsuch secure compilation proofs. We are the first to mechanize such a\nrecomposition lemma in a proof assistant in the presence of memory sharing.\nWe put these two key innovations to use in a secure compilation proof for a\ncode generation compiler pass between a safe source language with pointers and\ncomponents, and a target language with unstructured control flow.",

Data-driven method called the extended dynamic\nmode decomposition (EDMD) and its variants, which approximate the Koopman\noperator associated with the nonlinear phenomena, have been rapidly developing\nby incorporating machine learning methods. Neural ordinary differential\nequations (NODEs), which are a neural network equipped with a continuum of\nlayers, and have high parameter and memory efficiencies, have been proposed. In\nthis paper, we propose an algorithm to perform EDMD using NODEs. NODEs are used\nto find a parameter-efficient dictionary which provides a good\nfinite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator.

We consider time-division duplex\n(TDD) transmission, where the users harvest power from the signal received in\nthe downlink phase, and then, utilize this harvested power for information\ntransmission in the uplink phase. In contrast to existing works, we adopt a\nnon-linear model of the harvested power based on a precise analysis of the\nemployed EH circuit. We jointly optimize the beamforming vectors in the\ndownlink and the time allocated for downlink and uplink transmission to\nminimize the average transmit power in the downlink under per-user data rate\nconstraints in the uplink. We provide conditions for the feasibility of the\nresource allocation problem and the existence of a trivial solution,\nrespectively. For the case where the resource allocation has a non-trivial\nsolution, we show that it is optimal to employ no more than three beamforming\nvectors for power transfer in the downlink. To determine these beamforming\nvectors, we develop an iterative algorithm based on semi-definite relaxation\n(SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA).

The article discusses the\napplication of unsupervised machine learning to support the pragmatic designs\nof complex experiments. Complex experiments are characterized by having a large\nnumber of factors, mixed-level designs, and may be subject to constraints that\neliminate some unfeasible trials for various reasons. Having such attributes,\nit is very challenging to design pragmatic experiments that are economically,\noperationally, and timely sound. It means a significant decrease in the number\nof required trials from a full factorial design, while still attempting to\nachieve the defined objectives. A beta variational autoencoder (beta-VAE) has\nbeen applied to represent trials of the initial full factorial design after\nfiltering out unfeasible trials on the low dimensional latent space. Regarding\nvisualization and interpretability, the paper is limited to 2D representations.\nBeta-VAE supports (1) orthogonality of the latent space dimensions, (2)\nisotropic multivariate standard normal distribution of the representation on\nthe latent space, (3) disentanglement of the latent space representation by\nlevels of factors, (4) propagation of the applied constraints of the initial\ndesign into the latent space, and (5) generation of trials by decoding latent\nspace points.

Thus, how to attain promising\nresults while largely reducing labeling works become an essential issue. In\nthis study, we propose a deep-learning based weakly supervised framework for\nsemantic segmentation of ALS point clouds, exploiting potential information\nfrom unlabeled data subject to incomplete and sparse labels. Entropy\nregularization is introduced to penalize the class overlap in predictive\nprobability. Additionally, a consistency constraint by minimizing difference\nbetween current and ensemble predictions is designed to improve the robustness\nof predictions. Finally, we propose an online soft pseudo-labeling strategy to\ncreate extra supervisory sources in an efficient and nonpaprametric way.\nExtensive experimental analysis using three benchmark datasets demonstrates\nthat in case of sparse point annotations, our proposed method significantly\nboosts the classification performance without compromising the computational\nefficiency. It outperforms current weakly supervised methods and achieves a\ncomparable result against full supervision competitors. For the ISPRS 3D\nLabeling Vaihingen data, by using only 0.1% of labels, our method achieves an\noverall accuracy of 83.0% and an average F1 score of 70.0%, which have\nincreased by 6.9% and 12.8% respectively, compared to model trained by sparse\nlabel information only.",

In this paper, we present an alternative that achieves the\nbest of both worlds, namely good performance and transactional properties. Our\nkey observation is that, because of the frequent use of synchronization\nprimitives, systems with strong durability can hardly utilize the extremely\nhigh parallelism granted by modern storage devices. Thus, we explore the notion\nof weakly durable transactions, and discuss how to safely relax durability\nwithout compromising other transactional properties. We present AciKV, a\ntransactional system whose design is centered around weak durability. AciKV\nexposes to users the normal transactional interface, but what sets it apart\nfrom others is a new \"persist\" primitive that decouples durability from commit.\nAciKV is a middle ground between systems that perform fast atomic operations,\nand ones that support transactions; this middle ground is useful as it provides\nsimilar performance to the former, while prevents isolation and consistency\nanomalies like the latter.

    "abstract": "Real-time coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs) is crucial for\nregulating the voltage profile in distribution grids. By capitalizing on a\nscalable neural network (NN) architecture, machine learning tools can attain\ndecentralized DER decisions by minimizing the average loss of prediction. This\npaper aims to improve these learning-enabled approaches by accounting for the\npotential risks associated with reactive power prediction and voltage\ndeviation. Specifically, we advocate to measure such risks using the\nconditional value-at-risk (CVaR) loss based on the worst-case samples only,\nwhich could lead to the learning efficiency issue. To tackle this issue, we\npropose to accelerate the training process under the CVaR loss objective by\nselecting the mini-batches that are more likely to contain the worst-case\nsamples of interest. Numerical tests using real-world data on the IEEE 123-bus\ntest case have demonstrated the computation and safety improvements of the\nproposed risk-aware learning algorithm for decentralized DER decision making in\ndistribution systems.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, end-to-end (E2E) based automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nsystems have achieved great success due to their simplicity and promising\nperformance. Neural Transducer based models are increasingly popular in\nstreaming E2E based ASR systems and have been reported to outperform the\ntraditional hybrid system in some scenarios. However, the joint optimization of\nacoustic model, lexicon and language model in neural Transducer also brings\nabout challenges to utilize pure text for language model adaptation. This\ndrawback might prevent their potential applications in practice. In order to\naddress this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel model, factorized neural\nTransducer, by factorizing the blank and vocabulary prediction, and adopting a\nstandalone language model for the vocabulary prediction. It is expected that\nthis factorization can transfer the improvement of the standalone language\nmodel to the Transducer for speech recognition, which allows various language\nmodel adaptation techniques to be applied. The experiment results show that, in\nspite of minor performance degradation in the general test set introduced by\nthe factorization, the proposed factorized neural Transducer presents 15% to\n20% WER improvements when the out-of-domain text data is available for language\nmodel adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Underspecification and fairness in machine learning (ML) applications have\nrecently become two prominent issues in the ML community. Acoustic scene\nclassification (ASC) applications have so far remained unaffected by this\ndiscussion, but are now becoming increasingly used in real-world systems where\nfairness and reliability are critical aspects. In this work, we argue for the\nneed of a more holistic evaluation process for ASC models through disaggregated\nevaluations. This entails taking into account performance differences across\nseveral factors, such as city, location, and recording device. Although these\nfactors play a well-understood role in the performance of ASC models, most\nworks report single evaluation metrics taking into account all different strata\nof a particular dataset. We argue that metrics computed on specific\nsub-populations of the underlying data contain valuable information about the\nexpected real-world behaviour of proposed systems, and their reporting could\nimprove the transparency and trustability of such systems. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed evaluation process in uncovering\nunderspecification and fairness problems exhibited by several standard ML\narchitectures when trained on two widely-used ASC datasets. Our evaluation\nshows that all examined architectures exhibit large biases across all factors\ntaken into consideration, and in particular with respect to the recording\nlocation.

Whereas wind power plant\nrating and export cable length are increasing, further weakening the system\nstrength and accompanied by stability challenges. Under such a scenario, a grid\nforming control demonstrated to operate in a weaker system has value creation\npotential for application in wind turbine generators. In addition, the grid\nforming control can also enable a wind power plant to operate in islanded mode,\nprovide inertially and phase jump active power support.

However, there could be potential challenges in maintaining\nthe synchronism of GFC when the current limit is triggered, particularly during\nthe grid voltage phase jump event.

    "title": "Traffic Flow Forecasting with Maintenance Downtime via Multi-Channel  Attention-Based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks",
    "abstract": "Forecasting traffic flows is a central task in intelligent transportation\nsystem management. Graph structures have shown promise as a modeling framework,\nwith recent advances in spatio-temporal modeling via graph convolution neural\nnetworks, improving the performance or extending the prediction horizon on\ntraffic flows. However, a key shortcoming of state-of-the-art methods is their\ninability to take into account information of various modalities, for instance\nthe impact of maintenance downtime on traffic flows. This is the issue we\naddress in this paper. Specifically, we propose a novel model to predict\ntraffic speed under the impact of construction work. The model is based on the\npowerful attention-based spatio-temporal graph convolution architecture but\nutilizes various channels to integrate different sources of information,\nexplicitly builds spatio-temporal dependencies among traffic states, captures\nthe relationships between heterogeneous roadway networks, and then predicts\nchanges in traffic flow resulting from maintenance downtime events. The model\nis evaluated on two benchmark datasets and a novel dataset we have collected\nover the bustling Tyson's corner region in Northern Virginia. Extensive\ncomparative experiments and ablation studies show that the proposed model can\ncapture complex and nonlinear spatio-temporal relationships across a\ntransportation corridor, outperforming baseline models.",

Under\nmild assumptions, we establish the convergence theory of SAM, including the\nalmost sure convergence to stationary points and the worst-case iteration\ncomplexity.

To further accelerate the convergence, we\nincorporate a variance reduction technique into the proposed SAM.

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL), which aims to find an optimal\npolicy from a previously collected static dataset, bears algorithmic\ndifficulties due to function approximation errors from out-of-distribution\n(OOD) data points. To this end, offline RL algorithms adopt either a constraint\nor a penalty term that explicitly guides the policy to stay close to the given\ndataset. However, prior methods typically require accurate estimation of the\nbehavior policy or sampling from OOD data points, which themselves can be a\nnon-trivial problem. Moreover, these methods under-utilize the generalization\nability of deep neural networks and often fall into suboptimal solutions too\nclose to the given dataset. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-based\noffline RL method that takes into account the confidence of the Q-value\nprediction and does not require any estimation or sampling of the data\ndistribution. We show that the clipped Q-learning, a technique widely used in\nonline RL, can be leveraged to successfully penalize OOD data points with high\nprediction uncertainties. Surprisingly, we find that it is possible to\nsubstantially outperform existing offline RL methods on various tasks by simply\nincreasing the number of Q-networks along with the clipped Q-learning. Based on\nthis observation, we propose an ensemble-diversified actor-critic algorithm\nthat reduces the number of required ensemble networks down to a tenth compared\nto the naive ensemble while achieving state-of-the-art performance on most of\nthe D4RL benchmarks considered",

PTLMs have shown great success in many question-answering tasks, given\nsignificant supervised training, but much less so in zero-shot settings. We\npropose a new task that includes two college-level introductory texts in the\nsocial sciences (American Government 2e) and humanities (U.S. History),\nhundreds of true/false statements based on review questions written by the\ntextbook authors, validation/development tests based on the first eight\nchapters of the textbooks, blind tests based on the remaining textbook\nchapters, and baseline results given state-of-the-art PTLMs. Since the\nquestions are balanced, random performance should be ~50%. T5, fine-tuned with\nBoolQ achieves the same performance, suggesting that the textbook's content is\nnot pre-represented in the PTLM. Taking the exam closed book, but having read\nthe textbook (i.e., adding the textbook to T5's pre-training), yields at best\nminor improvement (56%), suggesting that the PTLM may not have \"understood\" the\ntextbook (or perhaps misunderstood the questions).

To better match the source face with the target situation in\nterms of pose, expression, and background factors, we model the bias as a\ncausal effect of the target situation on source identity and estimate this\neffect through a controlled intervention trial. To achieve smoother transfer\nfor the target face across the identity gap, we eliminate the target face\nspecificity through multiple kernel regressions. The kernels are used to\nconstrain the regressions to operate only on identity information in the\ninternal representations of the target image, while leaving other perceptual\ninformation invariant. Combining these post-regression representations with the\nbiased estimation for identity, EVA shows impressive performance even in the\npresence of large gaps, providing empirical evidence supporting the utility of\nthe inductive biases in identity estimation.",

In recent years, roboticists have been seeking a solution to this\nchallenge through soft robots. Unfortunately, it is often challenging to find\nthe optimal model to fully investigate and analyze the behavior of a soft\nrobot. This paper seeks to address this challenge by proposing two\ncomplementary modeling techniques for a particular type of soft robotic\nactuator known as Fiber Reinforced Elastomeric Enclosures (FREEs). We propose\nthat designers can leverage multiple models to fill the gaps in the\nunderstanding of soft robots. We develop and test both a dynamic\nlumped-parameter model and a finite element model in an attempt to understand\nthe practicability of FREEs for use in a soft robotic arm. The resulting\ninsights enabled us to investigate the controllability of FREEs using the\ndynamic model, and its design parameters and workspace via the finite element\nmodel. The results from the lumped-parameter model allowed us to make\nsimplifying assumptions that led to the development of a model-driven\ncontroller for a single FREE, although extending this model for a module of\nmultiple FREEs can be challenging. This provided motivation for the development\nof a finite element model for single and multiple FREE configurations. Our\nfindings indicate that the material properties and winding angles greatly\ninfluence FREEs' extension, rotation, and force and moment generation. Overall,\nboth models efficiently predict the behavior of FREEs. Employing two modeling\napproaches enabled us to fully investigate behavior, whereas neither model\nindividually significantly demonstrates the complete range of FREE\ncapabilities.",

In urban environments, however,\nGNSS measurements are significantly degraded due to occlusions and multipath.\nThis research analyzes the use of camera Line-of-Sight (LOS) measurements to\nself-describing fiducials as a replacement for conventional GNSS measurements.\nAn extended Kalman filter (EKF) is developed and validated for the purpose of\ncombining continuous measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) with\nthe discrete LOS measurements to accurately estimate the states of a UAV. The\nsensitivity of the estimation error covariance to various system parameters is\nassessed, including IMU grade, fiducial placement, vehicle altitude, and image\nprocessing frequency.",

    "abstract": "One key feature of dense passage retrievers (DPR) is the use of separate\nquestion and passage encoder in a bi-encoder design. Previous work on\ngeneralization of DPR mainly focus on testing both encoders in tandem on\nout-of-distribution (OOD) question-answering (QA) tasks, which is also known as\ndomain adaptation. However, it is still unknown how DPR's individual\nquestion/passage encoder affects generalization. Specifically, in this paper,\nwe want to know how an in-distribution (IND) question/passage encoder would\ngeneralize if paired with an OOD passage/question encoder from another domain.\nWe refer to this challenge as \\textit{encoder adaptation}. To answer this\nquestion, we inspect different combinations of DPR's question and passage\nencoder learned from five benchmark QA datasets on both in-domain and\nout-of-domain questions. We find that the passage encoder has more influence on\nthe lower bound of generalization while the question encoder seems to affect\nthe upper bound in general. For example, applying an OOD passage encoder\nusually hurts the retrieval accuracy while an OOD question encoder sometimes\neven improves the accuracy.",

We extend the standard delayed\nrejection framework by allowing the probability of a retry to depend on the\nprobability of accepting the previous proposal.

Delayed rejection enables up to five-fold\nperformance gains over optimally-tuned HMC, as measured by effective sample\nsize per gradient evaluation. Even for simpler distributions, delayed rejection\nprovides increased robustness to step size misspecification.

Garnett is a cell-type annotation software based the on\nelastic net method. Besides cell-type annotation, supervised machine learning\nmethods can also be applied to predict other cell phenotypes from genomic data.\nDespite the popularity of such applications, there is no existing study to\nsystematically investigate the performance of those supervised algorithms in\nvarious sizes of scRNA-seq data sets.\nMethods and Results: This study evaluates 13 popular supervised machine\nlearning algorithms to classify cell phenotypes, using published real and\nsimulated data sets with diverse cell sizes. The benchmark contained two parts.\nIn the first part, we used real data sets to assess the popular supervised\nalgorithms' computing speed and cell phenotype classification performance.

Here, we put forward a machine learning (ML) approach, applying an\nartificial neural network (ANN) and a local spin descriptor to develop\neffective spin potentials for any form of interaction. The constructed\nHamiltonians include an explicit Heisenberg part and an implicit non-linear ANN\npart.

    "abstract": "Echo and noise suppression is an integral part of a full-duplex communication\nsystem. Many recent acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) systems rely on a separate\nadaptive filtering module for linear echo suppression and a neural module for\nresidual echo suppression. However, not only do adaptive filtering modules\nrequire convergence and remain susceptible to changes in acoustic environments,\nbut this two-stage framework also often introduces unnecessary delays to the\nAEC system when neural modules are already capable of both linear and nonlinear\necho suppression. In this paper, we exploit the offset-compensating ability of\ncomplex time-frequency masks and propose an end-to-end complex-valued neural\nnetwork architecture. The building block of the proposed model is a\npseudocomplex extension based on the densely-connected multidilated DenseNet\n(D3Net) building block, resulting in a very small network of only 354K\nparameters. The architecture utilized the multi-resolution nature of the D3Net\nbuilding blocks to eliminate the need for pooling, allowing the network to\nextract features using large receptive fields without any loss of output\nresolution. We also propose a dual-mask technique for joint echo and noise\nsuppression with simultaneous speech enhancement. Evaluation on both synthetic\nand real test sets demonstrated promising results across multiple energy-based\nmetrics and perceptual proxies.",

The method of separation of variables is employed to\ndetermine the exact thermal response during the starting of a solar collector.\nThe thermal field is represented by 2-D thermal contours and 3-D surface plots\nto provide an accurate prediction compared to the 1-D analysis using the\ntime-lag theory. An influence of Fourier number on the heat flow in the\nabsorber plate is studied for different thermal relaxation times.

Differences in two models of heat\npropagation, viz. classical and thermal wave, in the absorber plate have an\nalteration in predicted collector performances. The present study also develops\nanother design situation for heat transfer in the absorber plate when the\ncollector shutdowns to the ambient state from its steady condition. Laplace\nTransform Method (LTM) in combination with the product solution method uses to\ndetermine the temperature with the initial condition represented as a steady\ncase. Due to the lagging nature of thermal behavior, a significant difference\nbetween the classical and thermal wave models for the propagation of heat was\nobserved, and also this study determines the exact time to be taken to reach\nthe dead state for the complete shutdown of the collector.",

Specifically, we\ndetermine the speed and energy efficiency a quantum computer needs to offer an\nadvantage over classical mining. We analyze the setting in which the Bitcoin\nnetwork is entirely classical except for a single quantum miner who has small\nhash rate compared to that of the network. We develop a closed-form\napproximation for the probability that the quantum miner successfully mines a\nblock, with this probability dependent on the number of Grover iterations the\nquantum miner applies before making a measurement. Next, we show that, for a\nquantum miner that is \"peaceful\", this success probability is maximized if the\nquantum miner applies Grover iterations for 16 minutes before measuring, which\nis surprising as the network mines blocks every 10 minutes on average. Using\nthis optimal mining procedure, we show that the quantum miner outperforms a\nclassical computer in efficiency (cost per block) if the condition $Q < Crb$ is\nsatisfied, where $Q$ is the cost of a Grover iteration, $C$ is the cost of a\nclassical hash, $r$ is the quantum miner's speed in Grover iterations per\nsecond, and $b$ is a factor that attains its maximum if the quantum miner uses\nour optimal mining procedure.

    "abstract": "In the last decade, researchers working in the domain of computer vision and\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) have beefed up their efforts to come up with the\nautomated framework that not only detects but also identifies stage of breast\ncancer. The reason for this surge in research activities in this direction are\nmainly due to advent of robust AI algorithms (deep learning), availability of\nhardware that can train those robust and complex AI algorithms and\naccessibility of large enough dataset required for training AI algorithms.\nDifferent imaging modalities that have been exploited by researchers to\nautomate the task of breast cancer detection are mammograms, ultrasound,\nmagnetic resonance imaging, histopathological images or any combination of\nthem. This article analyzes these imaging modalities and presents their\nstrengths, limitations and enlists resources from where their datasets can be\naccessed for research purpose. This article then summarizes AI and computer\nvision based state-of-the-art methods proposed in the last decade, to detect\nbreast cancer using various imaging modalities. Generally, in this article we\nhave focused on to review frameworks that have reported results using\nmammograms as it is most widely used breast imaging modality that serves as\nfirst test that medical practitioners usually prescribe for the detection of\nbreast cancer. Second reason of focusing on mammogram imaging modalities is the\navailability of its labeled datasets. Datasets availability is one of the most\nimportant aspect for the development of AI based frameworks as such algorithms\nare data hungry and generally quality of dataset affects performance of AI\nbased algorithms. In a nutshell, this research article will act as a primary\nresource for the research community working in the field of automated breast\nimaging analysis.",

    "abstract": "Consistent segmentation of COVID-19 patient's CT scans across multiple time\npoints is essential to assess disease progression and response to therapy\naccurately. Existing automatic and interactive segmentation models for medical\nimages only use data from a single time point (static). However, valuable\nsegmentation information from previous time points is often not used to aid the\nsegmentation of a patient's follow-up scans. Also, fully automatic segmentation\ntechniques frequently produce results that would need further editing for\nclinical use. In this work, we propose a new single network model for\ninteractive segmentation that fully utilizes all available past information to\nrefine the segmentation of follow-up scans. In the first segmentation round,\nour model takes 3D volumes of medical images from two-time points (target and\nreference) as concatenated slices with the additional reference time point\nsegmentation as a guide to segment the target scan. In subsequent segmentation\nrefinement rounds, user feedback in the form of scribbles that correct the\nsegmentation and the target's previous segmentation results are additionally\nfed into the model. This ensures that the segmentation information from\nprevious refinement rounds is retained. Experimental results on our in-house\nmulticlass longitudinal COVID-19 dataset show that the proposed model\noutperforms its static version and can assist in localizing COVID-19 infections\nin patient's follow-up scans.",

    "abstract": "Real-world low-light images suffer from two main degradations, namely,\ninevitable noise and poor visibility. Since the noise exhibits different\nlevels, its estimation has been implemented in recent works when enhancing\nlow-light images from raw Bayer space. When it comes to sRGB color space, the\nnoise estimation becomes more complicated due to the effect of the image\nprocessing pipeline. Nevertheless, most existing enhancing algorithms in sRGB\nspace only focus on the low visibility problem or suppress the noise under a\nhypothetical noise level, leading them impractical due to the lack of\nrobustness. To address this issue,we propose an adaptive unfolding total\nvariation network (UTVNet), which approximates the noise level from the real\nsRGB low-light image by learning the balancing parameter in the model-based\ndenoising method with total variation regularization. Meanwhile, we learn the\nnoise level map by unrolling the corresponding minimization process for\nproviding the inferences of smoothness and fidelity constraints. Guided by the\nnoise level map, our UTVNet can recover finer details and is more capable to\nsuppress noise in real captured low-light scenes. Extensive experiments on\nreal-world low-light images clearly demonstrate the superior performance of\nUTVNet over state-of-the-art methods.",

Particularly, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have\ndemonstrated remarkable success in various molecular generation and prediction\ntasks. In cases where labeled data is scarce, GNNs can be pre-trained on\nunlabeled molecular data to first learn the general semantic and structural\ninformation before being fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, most existing\nself-supervised pre-training frameworks for GNNs only focus on node-level or\ngraph-level tasks. These approaches cannot capture the rich information in\nsubgraphs or graph motifs. For example, functional groups (frequently-occurred\nsubgraphs in molecular graphs) often carry indicative information about the\nmolecular properties. To bridge this gap, we propose Motif-based Graph\nSelf-supervised Learning (MGSSL) by introducing a novel self-supervised motif\ngeneration framework for GNNs. First, for motif extraction from molecular\ngraphs, we design a molecule fragmentation method that leverages a\nretrosynthesis-based algorithm BRICS and additional rules for controlling the\nsize of motif vocabulary. Second, we design a general motif-based generative\npre-training framework in which GNNs are asked to make topological and label\npredictions. This generative framework can be implemented in two different\nways, i.e., breadth-first or depth-first. Finally, to take the multi-scale\ninformation in molecular graphs into consideration, we introduce a multi-level\nself-supervised pre-training.

    "abstract": "End-to-end learners for autonomous driving are deep neural networks that\npredict the instantaneous steering angle directly from images of the\nahead-lying street. These learners must provide reliable uncertainty estimates\nfor their predictions in order to meet safety requirements and initiate a\nswitch to manual control in areas of high uncertainty. Yet end-to-end learners\ntypically only deliver point predictions, since distributional predictions are\nassociated with large increases in training time or additional computational\nresources during prediction. To address this shortcoming we investigate\nefficient and scalable approximate inference for the implicit copula neural\nlinear model of Klein, Nott and Smith (2021) in order to quantify uncertainty\nfor the predictions of end-to-end learners. The result are densities for the\nsteering angle that are marginally calibrated, i.e.~the average of the\nestimated densities equals the empirical distribution of steering angles. To\nensure the scalability to large $n$ regimes, we develop efficient estimation\nbased on variational inference as a fast alternative to computationally\nintensive, exact inference via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We demonstrate the\naccuracy and speed of the variational approach in comparison to Hamiltonian\nMonte Carlo on two end-to-end learners trained for highway driving using the\ncomma2k19 data set. The implicit copula neural linear model delivers accurate\ncalibration, high-quality prediction intervals and allows to identify\noverconfident learners.

    "abstract": "Recent studies revealed an important interplay between the detailed structure\nof fibration symmetric circuits and the functionality of biological and\nnon-biological networks within which they have be identified. The presence of\nthese circuits in complex networks are directed related to the phenomenon of\ncluster synchronization, which produces patterns of synchronized group of\nnodes. Here we present a fast, and memory efficient, algorithm to identify\nfibration symmetries over information-processing networks. This algorithm is\nspecially suitable for large and sparse networks since it has runtime of\ncomplexity $O(M\\log N)$ and requires $O(M+N)$ of memory resources, where $N$\nand $M$ are the number of nodes and edges in the network, respectively. We\npropose a modification on the so-called refinement paradigm to identify\ncircuits symmetrical to information flow (i.e., fibers) by finding the coarsest\nrefinement partition over the network. Finally, we show that the presented\nalgorithm provides an optimal procedure for identifying fibers, overcoming the\ncurrent approaches used in the literature.",

    "abstract": "We consider a centralized detection problem where sensors experience noisy\nmeasurements and intermittent connectivity to a centralized fusion center. The\nsensors may collaborate locally within predefined sensor clusters and fuse\ntheir noisy sensor data to reach a common local estimate of the detected event\nin each cluster. The connectivity of each sensor cluster is intermittent and\ndepends on the available communication opportunities of the sensors to the\nfusion center. Upon receiving the estimates from all the connected sensor\nclusters the fusion center fuses the received estimates to make a final\ndetermination regarding the occurrence of the event across the deployment area.\nWe refer to this hybrid communication scheme as a cloud-cluster architecture.\nWe propose a method for optimizing the decision rule for each cluster and\nanalyzing the expected detection performance resulting from our hybrid scheme.\nOur method is tractable and addresses the high computational complexity caused\nby heterogeneous sensors' and clusters' detection quality, heterogeneity in\ntheir communication opportunities, and non-convexity of the loss function. Our\nanalysis shows that clustering the sensors provides resilience to noise in the\ncase of low sensor communication probability with the cloud.

    "abstract": "Emotional voice conversion (VC) aims to convert a neutral voice to an\nemotional (e.g. happy) one while retaining the linguistic information and\nspeaker identity. We note that the decoupling of emotional features from other\nspeech information (such as speaker, content, etc.) is the key to achieving\nremarkable performance. Some recent attempts about speech representation\ndecoupling on the neutral speech can not work well on the emotional speech, due\nto the more complex acoustic properties involved in the latter. To address this\nproblem, here we propose a novel Source-Filter-based Emotional VC model (SFEVC)\nto achieve proper filtering of speaker-independent emotion features from both\nthe timbre and pitch features. Our SFEVC model consists of multi-channel\nencoders, emotion separate encoders, and one decoder. Note that all encoder\nmodules adopt a designed information bottlenecks auto-encoder. Additionally, to\nfurther improve the conversion quality for various emotions, a novel two-stage\ntraining strategy based on the 2D Valence-Arousal (VA) space was proposed.\nExperimental results show that the proposed SFEVC along with a two-stage\ntraining strategy outperforms all baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance in speaker-independent emotional VC with nonparallel data.",

    "abstract": "Spatial structures in the 3D space are important to determine molecular\nproperties. Recent papers use geometric deep learning to represent molecules\nand predict properties. These papers, however, are computationally expensive in\ncapturing long-range dependencies of input atoms; and have not considered the\nnon-uniformity of interatomic distances, thus failing to learn\ncontext-dependent representations at different scales. To deal with such\nissues, we introduce 3D-Transformer, a variant of the Transformer for molecular\nrepresentations that incorporates 3D spatial information. 3D-Transformer\noperates on a fully-connected graph with direct connections between atoms. To\ncope with the non-uniformity of interatomic distances, we develop a multi-scale\nself-attention module that exploits local fine-grained patterns with increasing\ncontextual scales. As molecules of different sizes rely on different kinds of\nspatial features, we design an adaptive position encoding module that adopts\ndifferent position encoding methods for small and large molecules. Finally, to\nattain the molecular representation from atom embeddings, we propose an\nattentive farthest point sampling algorithm that selects a portion of atoms\nwith the assistance of attention scores, overcoming handicaps of the virtual\nnode and previous distance-dominant downsampling methods. We validate\n3D-Transformer across three important scientific domains: quantum chemistry,\nmaterial science, and proteomics. Our experiments show significant improvements\nover state-of-the-art models on the crystal property prediction task and the\nprotein-ligand binding affinity prediction task, and show better or competitive\nperformance in quantum chemistry molecular datasets.

    "title": "Pharmacoprint -- a combination of pharmacophore fingerprint and  artificial intelligence as a tool for computer-aided drug design",
    "abstract": "Structural fingerprints and pharmacophore modeling are methodologies that\nhave been used for at least two decades in various fields of cheminformatics:\nfrom similarity searching to machine learning (ML). Advances in silico\ntechniques consequently led to combining both these methodologies into a new\napproach known as pharmacophore fingerprint. Herein, we propose a\nhigh-resolution, pharmacophore fingerprint called Pharmacoprint that encodes\nthe presence, types, and relationships between pharmacophore features of a\nmolecule. Pharmacoprint was evaluated in classification experiments by using ML\nalgorithms (logistic regression, support vector machines, linear support vector\nmachines, and neural networks) and outperformed other popular molecular\nfingerprints (i.e., Estate, MACCS, PubChem, Substructure, Klekotha-Roth, CDK,\nExtended, and GraphOnly) and ChemAxon Pharmacophoric Features fingerprint.\nPharmacoprint consisted of 39973 bits; several methods were applied for\ndimensionality reduction, and the best algorithm not only reduced the length of\nbit string but also improved the efficiency of ML tests. Further optimization\nallowed us to define the best parameter settings for using Pharmacoprint in\ndiscrimination tests and for maximizing statistical parameters. Finally,\nPharmacoprint generated for 3D structures with defined hydrogens as input data\nwas applied to neural networks with a supervised autoencoder for selecting the\nmost important bits and allowed to maximize Matthews Correlation Coefficient up\nto 0.962. The results show the potential of Pharmacoprint as a new, perspective\ntool for computer-aided drug design.",

Statistical causal models are statistical models embedded with\ncausal assumptions that allow for the inference and reasoning about the\nbehavior of stochastic systems affected by external manipulation\n(interventions). This thesis contributes to the research areas concerning the\nestimation of causal effects, causal structure learning, and distributionally\nrobust (out-of-distribution generalizing) prediction methods. We present novel\nand consistent linear and non-linear causal effects estimators in instrumental\nvariable settings that employ data-dependent mean squared prediction error\nregularization. Our proposed estimators show, in certain settings, mean squared\nerror improvements compared to both canonical and state-of-the-art estimators.\nWe show that recent research on distributionally robust prediction methods has\nconnections to well-studied estimators from econometrics. This connection leads\nus to prove that general K-class estimators possess distributional robustness\nproperties. We, furthermore, propose a general framework for distributional\nrobustness with respect to intervention-induced distributions. In this\nframework, we derive sufficient conditions for the identifiability of\ndistributionally robust prediction methods and present impossibility results\nthat show the necessity of several of these conditions. We present a new\nstructure learning method applicable in additive noise models with directed\ntrees as causal graphs.

Early identification of glaucoma is generally made\nbased on functional, structural, and clinical assessments. However, due to the\nnature of the disease, researchers still debate which markers qualify as a\nconsistent glaucoma metric. Deep learning methods have partially solved this\ndilemma by bypassing the marker identification stage and analyzing high-level\ninformation directly to classify the data. Although favorable, these methods\nmake expert analysis difficult as they provide no insight into the model\ndiscrimination process.

Second, we show that, for\nanalytic kernels, like Gaussian and inverse multiquadric, target kernel KT\nadmits maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) guarantees comparable to square-root KT\nwithout the need for an explicit square-root kernel.
