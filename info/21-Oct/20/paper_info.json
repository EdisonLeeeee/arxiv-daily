    "abstract": "The security of patient information is important during the transfer of\nmedical data. A hybrid spatial domain watermarking algorithm that includes\nencryption, integrity protection and steganography is proposed to strengthen\nthe information originality based on the authentication. The proposed algorithm\nchecks whether the information of patients has been deliberately changed or\nnot. The created code is distributed at every pixel of the medical image and\nnot only in the regions of noninterest pixels, while the image details are\nstill preserved. To enhance the security of the watermarking code, \"SHA-1\" is\nused to get the initial key for the Symmetric Encryption Algorithm. The target\nof this approach is to preserve the content of the image and the watermark\nsimultaneously, this is achieved by synthesizing an encrypted watermark from\none of the components of the original image and not by embedding a watermark in\nthe image. To evaluate the proposed code the Least Significant Bit (LSB),\nBit2SB, and Bit3SB were used. The evaluation of the proposed code showed that\nthe LSB is of better quality but overall the Bit2SB is better in its ability\nagainst the active attacks up to a size of 2*2 pixels, and it preserves the\nhigh image quality.",

    "abstract": "Due to the widespread of advanced digital imaging devices, forgery of digital\nimages became more serious attack patterns. In this attack scenario, the\nattacker tries to manipulate the digital image to conceal some meaningful\ninformation of the genuine image for malicious purposes. This leads to increase\nsecurity interest about protecting images against integrity tampers. This paper\nproposes a novel technique for protecting colored images against forgery and\npixel tamper. The proposed approach is designed as a hybrid model from three\nsecurity techniques, Message Digest hashing algorithm (MD5), Advanced\nEncryption Standard-128 bits (AES), and Stenography. The proposed approach has\nbeen evaluated using set of image quality metrics for testing the impact of\nembedding the protection code on image quality.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various domains, and\nGNNs with sophisticated computational graph lead to higher latency and larger\nmemory consumption. Optimizing the GNN computational graph suffers from: (1)\nRedundant neural operator computation. The same data are propagated through the\ngraph structure to perform the same neural operation multiple times in GNNs,\nleading to redundant computation which accounts for 92.4% of total operators.\n(2) Inconsistent thread mapping. Efficient thread mapping schemes for\nvertex-centric and edge-centric operators are different. This inconsistency\nprohibits operator fusion to reduce memory IO. (3) Excessive intermediate data.\nFor GNN training which is usually performed concurrently with inference,\nintermediate data must be stored for the backward pass, consuming 91.9% of the\ntotal memory requirement. To tackle these challenges, we propose following\ndesigns to optimize the GNN computational graph from a novel coordinated\ncomputation, IO, and memory perspective: (1) Propagation-postponed operator\nreorganization. We reorganize operators to perform neural operations before the\npropagation, thus the redundant computation is eliminated. (2) Unified thread\nmapping for fusion. We propose a unified thread mapping scheme for both vertex-\nand edge-centric operators to enable fusion and reduce IO. (3) Intermediate\ndata recomputation. Intermediate data are recomputed during the backward pass\nto reduce the total memory consumption. Extensive experimental results on three\ntypical GNN models show that, we achieve up to 2.75x end-to-end speedup, 6.89x\nless memory IO, and 7.73x less memory consumption over state-of-the-art\nframeworks.",

    "abstract": "With growing usage of machine learning algorithms and big data in health\napplications, digital biomarkers have become an important key feature to ensure\nthe success of those applications. In this paper, we focus on one important\nuse-case, the long-term continuous monitoring of the cognitive ability of older\nadults. The cognitive ability is a factor both for long-term monitoring of\npeople living alone as well as an outcome in clinical studies. In this work, we\npropose a new digital biomarker for cognitive abilities based on location\neigenbehaviour obtained from contactless ambient sensors. Indoor location\ninformation obtained from passive infrared sensors is used to build a location\nmatrix covering several weeks of measurement. Based on the eigenvectors of this\nmatrix, the reconstruction error is calculated for various numbers of used\neigenvectors. The reconstruction error is used to predict cognitive ability\nscores collected at baseline, using linear regression. Additionally,\nclassification of normal versus pathological cognition level is performed using\na support-vector-machine. Prediction performance is strong for high levels of\ncognitive ability, but grows weaker for low levels of cognitive ability.\nClassification into normal versus pathological cognitive ability level reaches\nhigh accuracy with a AUC = 0.94. Due to the unobtrusive method of measurement\nbased on contactless ambient sensors, this digital biomarker of cognitive\nability is easily obtainable. The usage of the reconstruction error is a strong\ndigital biomarker for the binary classification and, to a lesser extent, for\nmore detailed prediction of interindividual differences in cognition.",

To this end, we introduce a novel\nanalytic framework to unveil hidden convexity in training deep neural networks.\nWe consider a parallel architecture with multiple ReLU sub-networks, which\nincludes many standard deep architectures and ResNets as its special cases. We\nthen show that the training problem with path regularization can be cast as a\nsingle convex optimization problem in a high-dimensional space. We further\nprove that the equivalent convex program is regularized via a group sparsity\ninducing norm. Thus, a path regularized parallel architecture with ReLU\nsub-networks can be viewed as a parsimonious feature selection method in\nhigh-dimensions. More importantly, we show that the computational complexity\nrequired to globally optimize the equivalent convex problem is polynomial-time\nwith respect to the number of data samples and feature dimension.

But the performance of 2D pose\ndetectors suffers from challenging situations such as occlusions and oblique\nviewing angles. To address these challenges, previous works derive\npoint-to-point correspondences between different views from epipolar geometry\nand utilize the correspondences to merge prediction heatmaps or feature\nrepresentations. Instead of post-prediction merge/calibration, here we\nintroduce a transformer framework for multi-view 3D pose estimation, aiming at\ndirectly improving individual 2D predictors by integrating information from\ndifferent views. Inspired by previous multi-modal transformers, we design a\nunified transformer architecture, named TransFusion, to fuse cues from both\ncurrent views and neighboring views. Moreover, we propose the concept of\nepipolar field to encode 3D positional information into the transformer model.\nThe 3D position encoding guided by the epipolar field provides an efficient way\nof encoding correspondences between pixels of different views.

Eliminating these reusable code snippets,\nknown as gadgets, has become one of the prime concerns of attack surface\nreduction. The aim is to break these chains of gadgets, thereby making such\ncode reuse attacks impossible or substantially less common. Previous work on\nattack surface reduction has typically tried to eliminate such attacks by\nsubsetting the application, e.g. via user-specified inputs, configurations, or\nfeatures, or by focusing on third-party libraries to achieve high gadget\nreductions with minimal interference to the application.\nIn this work we present a general, whole-program attack surface reduction\ntechnique called OCA that significantly reduces gadgets and has minor\nperformance degradation. OCA requires no user inputs and leaves all features\nintact. OCA identifies specific program points and through analysis determines\nkey function sets to enable/disable at runtime. The runtime system, thus,\ncontrols the set of enabled functions during execution, thereby significantly\nreducing the set of active gadgets an attacker can use, and by extension,\ncutting down the set of active gadget chains dramatically. On SPEC CPU 2017,\nour framework achieves 73.2% total gadget reduction with only 4% average\nslowdown. On 10 GNU coreutils applications, it achieves 87.2% reduction. On the\nnginx server it achieves 80.3% reduction with 2% slowdown.

Consider another network that takes four inputs -- the cards dealt to\nthe players in a game of contract bridge -- and decides which team can bid\ngame. Loosely speaking, if you exchange the hands of partners (north and south,\nor east and west), the decision would not change. However, it will change if,\nsay, you exchange north's hand with east. This permutation invariance property,\nfor certain permutations at input and output layers, is central to the\ncorrectness and robustness of these networks.\nThis paper proposes a sound, abstraction-based technique to establish\npermutation invariance in DNNs with ReLU as the activation function. The\ntechnique computes an over-approximation of the reachable states, and an\nunder-approximation of the safe states, and propagates this information across\nthe layers, both forward and backward.

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are a promising tool for Global Navigation\nSatellite System (GNSS) positioning in the presence of multipath and\nnon-line-of-sight errors, owing to their ability to model complex errors using\ndata. However, developing a DNN for GNSS positioning presents various\nchallenges, such as 1) poor numerical conditioning caused by large variations\nin measurements and position values across the globe, 2) varying number and\norder within the set of measurements due to changing satellite visibility, and\n3) overfitting to available data. In this work, we address the aforementioned\nchallenges and propose an approach for GNSS positioning by applying DNN-based\ncorrections to an initial position guess. Our DNN learns to output the position\ncorrection using the set of pseudorange residuals and satellite line-of-sight\nvectors as inputs. The limited variation in these input and output values\nimproves the numerical conditioning for our DNN. We design our DNN architecture\nto combine information from the available GNSS measurements, which vary both in\nnumber and order, by leveraging recent advancements in set-based deep learning\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Consistent state estimation is challenging, especially under the epistemic\nuncertainties arising from learned (nonlinear) dynamic and observation models.\nIn this work, we develop a set-based estimation algorithm, that produces\nzonotopic state estimates that respect the epistemic uncertainties in the\nlearned models, in addition to the aleatoric uncertainties. Our algorithm\nguarantees probabilistic consistency, in the sense that the true state is\nalways bounded by the zonotopes, with a high probability. We formally relate\nour set-based approach with the corresponding probabilistic approach (GP-EKF)\nin the case of learned (nonlinear) models. In particular, when linearization\nerrors and aleatoric uncertainties are omitted, and epistemic uncertainties are\nsimplified, our set-based approach reduces to its probabilistic counterpart.\nOur method's improved consistency is empirically demonstrated in both a\nsimulated pendulum domain and a real-world robot-assisted dressing domain,\nwhere the robot estimates the configuration of the human arm utilizing the\nforce measurements at its end effector.",

Characterizing these errors in easily\ninterpretable terms gives insight into whether a model is prone to making\nsystematic errors, but also gives a way to act and improve the model. In this\npaper we propose a method that allows us to do so for arbitrary classifiers by\nmining a small set of patterns that together succinctly describe the input data\nthat is partitioned according to correctness of prediction. We show this is an\ninstance of the more general label description problem, which we formulate in\nterms of the Minimum Description Length principle. To discover good pattern\nsets we propose the efficient and hyperparameter-free Premise algorithm, which\nthrough an extensive set of experiments we show on both synthetic and\nreal-world data performs very well in practice; unlike existing solutions it\nably recovers ground truth patterns, even on highly imbalanced data over many\nunique items, or where patterns are only weakly associated to labels.

This data is of many different\nvarieties, and can be of different levels of veracity e.g., precise, imprecise,\nuncertain, and missing, making it challenging to extract important information\nfrom such data. Yet, efficient analyses of this continuously growing and\nevolving COVID-19 data is crucial to inform -- often in real-time -- the\nrelevant measures needed for controlling, mitigating, and ultimately avoiding\nviral spread. Applying machine learning based algorithms to this big data is a\nnatural approach to take to this aim, since they can quickly scale to such\ndata, and extract the relevant information in the presence of variety and\ndifferent levels of veracity. This is important for COVID-19, and for potential\nfuture pandemics in general.\nIn this paper, we design a straightforward encoding of clinical data (on\ncategorical attributes) into a fixed-length feature vector representation, and\nthen propose a model that first performs efficient feature selection from such\nrepresentation. We apply this approach on two clinical datasets of the COVID-19\npatients and then apply different machine learning algorithms downstream for\nclassification purposes. We show that with the efficient feature selection\nalgorithm, we can achieve a prediction accuracy of more than 90\\% in most\ncases.

On the other hand, such studies will help to more\neffectively deal with any possible future pandemic. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus\ncontains different variants, each of them having different mutations,\nperforming any analysis on such data becomes a difficult task. It is well known\nthat much of the variation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome happens disproportionately\nin the spike region of the genome sequence -- the relatively short region which\ncodes for the spike protein(s). Hence, in this paper, we propose an approach to\ncluster spike protein sequences in order to study the behavior of different\nknown variants that are increasing at very high rate throughout the world. We\nuse a k-mers based approach to first generate a fixed-length feature vector\nrepresentation for the spike sequences. We then show that with the appropriate\nfeature selection, we can efficiently and effectively cluster the spike\nsequences based on the different variants.

    "abstract": "We can achieve significant gains in the value of computation by metareasoning\nabout the nature or extent of base-level problem solving before executing a\nsolution. However, resources that are irrevocably committed to metareasoning\nare not available for executing a solution. Thus, it is important to determine\nthe portion of resources we wish to apply to metareasoning and control versus\nto the execution of a solution plan. Recent research on rational agency has\nhighlighted the importance of limiting the consumption of resources by\nmetareasoning machinery. We shall introduce the metareasoning-partition\nproblem--the problem of ideally apportioning costly reasoning resources to\nplanning a solution versus applying resource to executing a solution to a\nproblem. We exercise prototypical metareasoning-partition models to probe the\nrelationships between time allocated to metareasoning and to execution for\ndifferent problem classes. Finally, we examine the value of metareasoning in\nthe context of our functional analyses.",

    "abstract": "Health care delivery is a collaborative process, requiring close coordination\namong networks of providers with specialized expertise. Yet in the United\nStates, care is often spread across multiple disconnected providers (e.g.,\nprimary care physicians, specialists), leading to fragmented care delivery\nnetworks, and contributing to higher costs and lower quality. While this\nproblem is well known, there are relatively few quantitative tools available\nfor characterizing care delivery networks at scale, thereby inhibiting deeper\nunderstanding of care fragmentation and efforts to address it. In this, study,\nwe conduct a large-scale analysis of care delivery networks across the United\nStates using the discrete Hodge decomposition, an emerging method of\ntopological data analysis. Using this technique, we decompose networks of\npatient flows among physicians into three orthogonal subspaces: gradient\n(acyclic flow), harmonic (global cyclic flow), and curl (local cyclic flow). We\ndocument substantial variation in the relative importance of each subspace,\nsuggesting that there may be systematic differences in the organization of care\ndelivery networks across health care markets. Moreover, we find that the\nrelative importance of each subspace is predictive of local care cost and\nquality, with outcomes tending to be better with greater curl flow and worse\nwith greater harmonic flow.",

    "abstract": "As a promising distributed learning technology, analog aggregation based\nfederated learning over the air (FLOA) provides high communication efficiency\nand privacy provisioning in edge computing paradigm. When all edge devices\n(workers) simultaneously upload their local updates to the parameter server\n(PS) through the commonly shared time-frequency resources, the PS can only\nobtain the averaged update rather than the individual local ones. As a result,\nsuch a concurrent transmission and aggregation scheme reduces the latency and\ncosts of communication but makes FLOA vulnerable to Byzantine attacks which\nthen degrade FLOA performance. For the design of Byzantine-resilient FLOA, this\npaper starts from analyzing the channel inversion (CI) power control mechanism\nthat is widely used in existing FLOA literature. Our theoretical analysis\nindicates that although CI can achieve good learning performance in the\nnon-attacking scenarios, it fails to work well with limited defensive\ncapability to Byzantine attacks. Then, we propose a novel defending scheme\ncalled best effort voting (BEV) power control policy integrated with stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD). Our BEV-SGD improves the robustness of FLOA to\nByzantine attacks, by allowing all the workers to send their local updates at\ntheir maximum transmit power. Under the strongest-attacking circumstance, we\nderive the expected convergence rates of FLOA with CI and BEV power control\npolicies, respectively.

Despite this advancement in different techniques for\ndistilling the knowledge, the aggregation of different paths for distillation\nhas not been studied comprehensively. This is of particular significance, not\nonly because different paths have different importance, but also due to the\nfact that some paths might have negative effects on the generalization\nperformance of the student model.

    "abstract": "Synthesis planning and reaction outcome prediction are two fundamental\nproblems in computer-aided organic chemistry for which a variety of data-driven\napproaches have emerged. Natural language approaches that model each problem as\na SMILES-to-SMILES translation lead to a simple end-to-end formulation, reduce\nthe need for data preprocessing, and enable the use of well-optimized machine\ntranslation model architectures. However, SMILES representations are not an\nefficient representation for capturing information about molecular structures,\nas evidenced by the success of SMILES augmentation to boost empirical\nperformance. Here, we describe a novel Graph2SMILES model that combines the\npower of Transformer models for text generation with the permutation invariance\nof molecular graph encoders that mitigates the need for input data\naugmentation. As an end-to-end architecture, Graph2SMILES can be used as a\ndrop-in replacement for the Transformer in any task involving\nmolecule(s)-to-molecule(s) transformations. In our encoder, an\nattention-augmented directed message passing neural network (D-MPNN) captures\nlocal chemical environments, and the global attention encoder allows for\nlong-range and intermolecular interactions, enhanced by graph-aware positional\nembedding. Graph2SMILES improves the top-1 accuracy of the Transformer\nbaselines by $1.7\\%$ and $1.9\\%$ for reaction outcome prediction on USPTO_480k\nand USPTO_STEREO datasets respectively, and by $9.8\\%$ for one-step\nretrosynthesis on the USPTO_50k dataset.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning is a fast growing area of ML where the training datasets\nare extremely distributed, all while dynamically changing over time. Models\nneed to be trained on clients' devices without any guarantees for either\nhomogeneity or stationarity of the local private data. The need for continual\ntraining has also risen, due to the ever-increasing production of in-task data.\nHowever, pursuing both directions at the same time is challenging, since client\ndata privacy is a major constraint, especially for rehearsal methods. Herein,\nwe propose a novel algorithm to address the incremental learning process in an\nFL scenario, based on realistic client enrollment scenarios where clients can\ndrop in or out dynamically. We first propose using deep Variational Embeddings\nthat secure the privacy of the client data. Second, we propose a server-side\ntraining method that enables a model to rehearse the previously learnt\nknowledge. Finally, we investigate the performance of federated incremental\nlearning in dynamic client enrollment scenarios. The proposed method shows\nparity with offline training on domain-incremental learning, addressing\nchallenges in both the dynamic enrollment of clients and the domain shifting of\nclient data.",

These problems have been widely studied in the\nstringology literature since the 1970s, and are known to be solvable by\nnear-linear time classical algorithms. In this work, we give quantum algorithms\nfor these problems with near-optimal query complexities and time complexities.\nSpecifically, we show that:\n- Longest Common Substring can be solved by a quantum algorithm in $\\tilde\nO(n^{2/3})$ time, improving upon the recent $\\tilde O(n^{5/6})$-time algorithm\nby Le Gall and Seddighin (2020). Our algorithm uses the MNRS quantum walk\nframework, together with a careful combination of string synchronizing sets\n(Kempa and Kociumaka, 2019) and generalized difference covers.\n- Lexicographically Minimal String Rotation can be solved by a quantum\nalgorithm in $n^{1/2 + o(1)}$ time, improving upon the recent $\\tilde\nO(n^{3/4})$-time algorithm by Wang and Ying (2020). We design our algorithm by\nfirst giving a new classical divide-and-conquer algorithm in near-linear time\nbased on exclusion rules, and then speeding it up quadratically using nested\nGrover search and quantum minimum finding.\n- Longest Square Substring can be solved by a quantum algorithm in $\\tilde\nO(\\sqrt{n})$ time. Our algorithm is an adaptation of the algorithm by Le Gall\nand Seddighin (2020) for the Longest Palindromic Substring problem, but uses\nadditional techniques to overcome the difficulty that binary search no longer\napplies.\nOur techniques naturally extend to other related string problems, such as\nLongest Repeated Substring, Longest Lyndon Substring, and Minimal Suffix.",

    "abstract": "End-to-end TTS suffers from high data requirements as it is difficult for\nboth costly speech corpora to cover all necessary knowledge and neural models\nto learn the knowledge, hence additional knowledge needs to be injected\nmanually. For example, to capture pronunciation knowledge on languages without\nregular orthography, a complicated grapheme-to-phoneme pipeline needs to be\nbuilt based on a structured, large pronunciation lexicon, leading to extra,\nsometimes high, costs to extend neural TTS to such languages. In this paper, we\npropose a framework to learn to extract knowledge from unstructured external\nresources using Token2Knowledge attention modules. The framework is applied to\nbuild a novel end-to-end TTS model named Neural Lexicon Reader that extracts\npronunciations from raw lexicon texts. Experiments support the potential of our\nframework that the model significantly reduces pronunciation errors in\nlow-resource, end-to-end Chinese TTS, and the lexicon-reading capability can be\ntransferred to other languages with a smaller amount of data.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks against commercial black-box speech platforms, including\ncloud speech APIs and voice control devices, have received little attention\nuntil recent years. The current \"black-box\" attacks all heavily rely on the\nknowledge of prediction/confidence scores to craft effective adversarial\nexamples, which can be intuitively defended by service providers without\nreturning these messages. In this paper, we propose two novel adversarial\nattacks in more practical and rigorous scenarios. For commercial cloud speech\nAPIs, we propose Occam, a decision-only black-box adversarial attack, where\nonly final decisions are available to the adversary. In Occam, we formulate the\ndecision-only AE generation as a discontinuous large-scale global optimization\nproblem, and solve it by adaptively decomposing this complicated problem into a\nset of sub-problems and cooperatively optimizing each one. Our Occam is a\none-size-fits-all approach, which achieves 100% success rates of attacks with\nan average SNR of 14.23dB, on a wide range of popular speech and speaker\nrecognition APIs, including Google, Alibaba, Microsoft, Tencent, iFlytek, and\nJingdong, outperforming the state-of-the-art black-box attacks. For commercial\nvoice control devices, we propose NI-Occam, the first non-interactive physical\nadversarial attack, where the adversary does not need to query the oracle and\nhas no access to its internal information and training data. We combine\nadversarial attacks with model inversion attacks, and thus generate the\nphysically-effective audio AEs with high transferability without any\ninteraction with target devices. Our experimental results show that NI-Occam\ncan successfully fool Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Google Assistant, iFlytek\nand Amazon Echo with an average SRoA of 52% and SNR of 9.65dB, shedding light\non non-interactive physical attacks against voice control devices.",

In this study we report on a data-driven approach based\non distributional-semantic word embeddings and clustering models to identify\nand uncover the descriptor sensory spaces of the perception verbs.

Thus, additionally considering the mask, which, in fact,\nrepresents the shape of the object, maIoU enables a more accurate supervision\nduring training. We present the effectiveness of maIoU on a state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) assigner, ATSS, by replacing IoU operation by our maIoU and training\nYOLACT, a SOTA real-time instance segmentation method. Using ATSS with maIoU\nconsistently outperforms (i) ATSS with IoU by $\\sim 1$ mask AP, (ii) baseline\nYOLACT with fixed IoU threshold assigner by $\\sim 2$ mask AP over different\nimage sizes and (iii) decreases the inference time by $25 \\%$ owing to using\nless anchors.

    "abstract": "Video anomaly detection is often seen as one-class classification (OCC)\nproblem due to the limited availability of anomaly examples. Typically, to\ntackle this problem, an autoencoder (AE) is trained to reconstruct the input\nwith training set consisting only of normal data. At test time, the AE is then\nexpected to well reconstruct the normal data while poorly reconstructing the\nanomalous data. However, several studies have shown that, even with only normal\ndata training, AEs can often start reconstructing anomalies as well which\ndepletes the anomaly detection performance. To mitigate this problem, we\npropose a novel methodology to train AEs with the objective of reconstructing\nonly normal data, regardless of the input (i.e., normal or abnormal). Since no\nreal anomalies are available in the OCC settings, the training is assisted by\npseudo anomalies that are generated by manipulating normal data to simulate the\nout-of-normal-data distribution. We additionally propose two ways to generate\npseudo anomalies: patch and skip frame based. Extensive experiments on three\nchallenging video anomaly datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method\nin improving conventional AEs, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

However, most existing keyphrase extraction approaches only\nfocus on the part of them, which leads to biased results. In this paper, we\npropose a new approach to estimate the importance of keyphrase from multiple\nperspectives (called as \\textit{KIEMP}) and further improve the performance of\nkeyphrase extraction. Specifically, \\textit{KIEMP} estimates the importance of\nphrase with three modules: a chunking module to measure its syntactic accuracy,\na ranking module to check its information saliency, and a matching module to\njudge the concept (i.e., topic) consistency between phrase and the whole\ndocument. These three modules are seamlessly jointed together via an end-to-end\nmulti-task learning model, which is helpful for three parts to enhance each\nother and balance the effects of three perspectives.

The pinching action\nflattens the tapes to produce a localized bending region, resulting in a\nrevolute joint that can change its orientation by cable tension and its\nlocation on the tapes though friction-driven movement of the pinching\nmechanism. We present the design, implementation, kinematic modeling, stiffness\nbehavior of the revolute joint, and quasi-static performance of this\nmanipulator. In particular, we demonstrate the ability of the manipulator to\nreach specified targets in free space, reach a 2D target with various\norientations, and maintain an end-effector angle or stationary bending point\nwhile changing the other.

Furthermore, AEFE is\ndistributed implemented by task-parallelism, data sampling, and searching\nschema based on Matrix Factorization field combination, to optimize the\nperformance and enhance the efficiency and scalability of the framework.\nExperiments conducted on some typical e-commerce datasets indicate that our\nmethod outperforms the classical machine learning models and state-of-the-art\ndeep learning models.",

    "abstract": "To achieve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning (RL), it necessitates\nefficiently exploring the underlying environment. Under the offline setting,\naddressing the exploration challenge lies in collecting an offline dataset with\nsufficient coverage. Motivated by such a challenge, we study the reward-free RL\nproblem, where an agent aims to thoroughly explore the environment without any\npre-specified reward function. Then, given any extrinsic reward, the agent\ncomputes the policy via a planning algorithm with offline data collected in the\nexploration phase. Moreover, we tackle this problem under the context of\nfunction approximation, leveraging powerful function approximators.\nSpecifically, we propose to explore via an optimistic variant of the\nvalue-iteration algorithm incorporating kernel and neural function\napproximations, where we adopt the associated exploration bonus as the\nexploration reward. Moreover, we design exploration and planning algorithms for\nboth single-agent MDPs and zero-sum Markov games and prove that our methods can\nachieve $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1 /\\varepsilon^2)$ sample complexity for\ngenerating a $\\varepsilon$-suboptimal policy or $\\varepsilon$-approximate Nash\nequilibrium when given an arbitrary extrinsic reward. To the best of our\nknowledge, we establish the first provably efficient reward-free RL algorithm\nwith kernel and neural function approximators.",

    "abstract": "This work studies learning from a synergy process of 3D Morphable Models\n(3DMM) and 3D facial landmarks to predict complete 3D facial geometry,\nincluding 3D alignment, face orientation, and 3D face modeling. Our synergy\nprocess leverages a representation cycle for 3DMM parameters and 3D landmarks.\n3D landmarks can be extracted and refined from face meshes built by 3DMM\nparameters. We next reverse the representation direction and show that\npredicting 3DMM parameters from sparse 3D landmarks improves the information\nflow. Together we create a synergy process that utilizes the relation between\n3D landmarks and 3DMM parameters, and they collaboratively contribute to better\nperformance. We extensively validate our contribution on full tasks of facial\ngeometry prediction and show our superior and robust performance on these tasks\nfor various scenarios.

Existing methods are based mainly on handcrafted\nfeature optimization, which cannot adequately capture high-level human\naesthetic senses. Deep learning provides a promising way, but owing to the\ncomplexity of collage and lack of training data, a solution has yet to be\nfound. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline for automatic generation of\naspect ratio specified collage and the reinforcement learning technique is\nintroduced in collage for the first time.

To\ninstruct the agent to improve both the overall layout and local details, the\nreward function is specially designed for collage, considering subjective and\nobjective factors. To overcome the lack of training data, we pretrain our deep\naesthetic network on a large scale image aesthetic dataset (CPC) for general\naesthetic feature extraction and propose an attention fusion module for\nstructural collage feature representation.

A recent study showed that a similar\nmethodology can also be applied to the audio domain. Specifically, the Audio\nSpectrogram Transformer (AST) achieves state-of-the-art results on various\naudio classification benchmarks. However, pure Transformer models tend to\nrequire more training data compared to CNNs, and the success of the AST relies\non supervised pretraining that requires a large amount of labeled data and a\ncomplex training pipeline, thus limiting the practical usage of AST.\nThis paper focuses on audio and speech classification, and aims to alleviate\nthe data requirement issues with the AST by leveraging self-supervised learning\nusing unlabeled data. Specifically, we propose to pretrain the AST model with\njoint discriminative and generative masked spectrogram patch modeling (MSPM)\nusing unlabeled audio from AudioSet and Librispeech. We evaluate our pretrained\nmodels on both audio and speech classification tasks including audio event\nclassification, keyword spotting, emotion recognition, and speaker\nidentification. The proposed self-supervised framework significantly boosts AST\nperformance on all tasks, with an average improvement of 60.9%, leading to\nsimilar or even better results than a supervised pretrained AST.

This\nidea has several advantages: 1) it provides a way to inject disconnectedness\ninto any GAN architecture, 2) since the rejection happens in the latent space,\nit avoids going through both the generator and the discriminator, saving\ncomputation time, 3) this importance weights formulation provides a principled\nway to reduce the Wasserstein's distance to the target distribution. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several datasets, both synthetic\nand high-dimensional.",

    "abstract": "Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are algorithms from deep learning\nleveraging physical laws by including partial differential equations (PDE)\ntogether with a respective set of boundary and initial conditions (BC / IC) as\npenalty terms into their loss function. As the PDE, BC and IC loss function\nparts can significantly differ in magnitudes, due to their underlying physical\nunits or stochasticity of initialisation, training of PINNs may suffer from\nsevere convergence and efficiency problems, causing PINNs to stay beyond\ndesirable approximation quality. In this work, we observe the significant role\nof correctly weighting the combination of multiple competitive loss functions\nfor training PINNs effectively. To that end, we implement and evaluate\ndifferent methods aiming at balancing the contributions of multiple terms of\nthe PINNs loss function and their gradients. After review of three existing\nloss scaling approaches (Learning Rate Annealing, GradNorm as well as\nSoftAdapt), we propose a novel self-adaptive loss balancing of PINNs called\nReLoBRaLo (Relative Loss Balancing with Random Lookback). Finally, the\nperformance of ReLoBRaLo is compared and verified against these approaches by\nsolving both forward as well as inverse problems on three benchmark PDEs for\nPINNs: Burgers' equation, Kirchhoff's plate bending equation and Helmholtz's\nequation. Our simulation studies show that ReLoBRaLo training is much faster\nand achieves higher accuracy than training PINNs with other balancing methods\nand hence is very effective and increases sustainability of PINNs algorithms.\nThe adaptability of ReLoBRaLo illustrates robustness across different PDE\nproblem settings. The proposed method can also be employed to the wider class\nof penalised optimisation problems, including PDE-constrained and Sobolev\ntraining apart from the studied PINNs examples.",

Within our design, a local aggregation branch is\nutilized to gather dense and informative short-term cues, while a high order\nlong-term inference branch is designed to reason the objective action class\nfrom high-order interaction between actor and other person or person pairs.\nBoth branches independently predict the context-specific actions and the\nresults are merged in the end.

Since many\ndaily activities are social in nature, support agents should understand a\nuser's social situation to offer comprehensive support. However, there are no\nsystematic approaches for developing support agents that are social situation\naware. We identify key requirements for a support agent to be social situation\naware and propose steps to realize those requirements. These steps are\npresented through a conceptual architecture that centers around two key ideas:\n(1) conceptualizing social situation awareness as an instantiation of `general'\nsituation awareness, and (2) using situation taxonomies as the key element of\nsuch instantiation. This enables support agents to represent a user's social\nsituation, comprehend its meaning, and assess its impact on the user's\nbehavior. We discuss empirical results supporting that the proposed approach\ncan be effective and illustrate how the architecture can be used in support\nagents through a use case.",

    "abstract": "Recent work reports disparate performance for intersectional racial groups\nacross face recognition tasks: face verification and identification. However,\nthe definition of those racial groups has a significant impact on the\nunderlying findings of such racial bias analysis. Previous studies define these\ngroups based on either demographic information (e.g. African, Asian etc.) or\nskin tone (e.g. lighter or darker skins). The use of such sensitive or broad\ngroup definitions has disadvantages for bias investigation and subsequent\ncounter-bias solutions design. By contrast, this study introduces an\nalternative racial bias analysis methodology via facial phenotype attributes\nfor face recognition. We use the set of observable characteristics of an\nindividual face where a race-related facial phenotype is hence specific to the\nhuman face and correlated to the racial profile of the subject. We propose\ncategorical test cases to investigate the individual influence of those\nattributes on bias within face recognition tasks. We compare our\nphenotype-based grouping methodology with previous grouping strategies and show\nthat phenotype-based groupings uncover hidden bias without reliance upon any\npotentially protected attributes or ill-defined grouping strategies.\nFurthermore, we contribute corresponding phenotype attribute category labels\nfor two face recognition tasks: RFW for face verification and VGGFace2 (test\nset) for face identification.",

    "abstract": "High Dynamic Range (HDR) content is becoming ubiquitous due to the rapid\ndevelopment of capture technologies. Nevertheless, the dynamic range of common\ndisplay devices is still limited, therefore tone mapping (TM) remains a key\nchallenge for image visualization. Recent work has demonstrated that neural\nnetworks can achieve remarkable performance in this task when compared to\ntraditional methods, however, the quality of the results of these\nlearning-based methods is limited by the training data. Most existing works use\nas training set a curated selection of best-performing results from existing\ntraditional tone mapping operators (often guided by a quality metric),\ntherefore, the quality of newly generated results is fundamentally limited by\nthe performance of such operators. This quality might be even further limited\nby the pool of HDR content that is used for training. In this work we propose a\nlearning-based self-supervised tone mapping operator that is trained at test\ntime specifically for each HDR image and does not need any data labeling. The\nkey novelty of our approach is a carefully designed loss function built upon\nfundamental knowledge on contrast perception that allows for directly comparing\nthe content in the HDR and tone mapped images. We achieve this goal by\nreformulating classic VGG feature maps into feature contrast maps that\nnormalize local feature differences by their average magnitude in a local\nneighborhood, allowing our loss to account for contrast masking effects. We\nperform extensive ablation studies and exploration of parameters and\ndemonstrate that our solution outperforms existing approaches with a single set\nof fixed parameters, as confirmed by both objective and subjective metrics.",

    "abstract": "Agitation is one of the neuropsychiatric symptoms with high prevalence in\ndementia which can negatively impact the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and\nthe independence of individuals. Detecting agitation episodes can assist in\nproviding People Living with Dementia (PLWD) with early and timely\ninterventions. Analysing agitation episodes will also help identify modifiable\nfactors such as ambient temperature and sleep as possible components causing\nagitation in an individual. This preliminary study presents a supervised\nlearning model to analyse the risk of agitation in PLWD using in-home\nmonitoring data. The in-home monitoring data includes motion sensors,\nphysiological measurements, and the use of kitchen appliances from 46 homes of\nPLWD between April 2019-June 2021. We apply a recurrent deep learning model to\nidentify agitation episodes validated and recorded by a clinical monitoring\nteam. We present the experiments to assess the efficacy of the proposed model.\nThe proposed model achieves an average of 79.78% recall, 27.66% precision and\n37.64% F1 scores when employing the optimal parameters, suggesting a good\nability to recognise agitation events. We also discuss using machine learning\nmodels for analysing the behavioural patterns using continuous monitoring data\nand explore clinical applicability and the choices between sensitivity and\nspecificity in-home monitoring applications.",

Target objects have large spatial\ndisplacements throughout consecutive frames. This nature of WAMI images makes\nobject tracking and detection challenging. In this paper, we present our deep\nneural network-based combined object detection and tracking model, namely, Heat\nMap Network (HM-Net). HM-Net is significantly faster than state-of-the-art\nframe differencing and background subtraction-based methods, without\ncompromising detection and tracking performances. HM-Net follows object\ncenter-based joint detection and tracking paradigm. Simple heat map-based\npredictions support unlimited number of simultaneous detections. The proposed\nmethod uses two consecutive frames and the object detection heat map obtained\nfrom the previous frame as input, which helps HM-Net monitor spatio-temporal\nchanges between frames and keeps track of previously predicted objects.\nAlthough reuse of prior object detection heat map acts as a vital\nfeedback-based memory element, it can lead to unintended surge of false\npositive detections. To increase robustness of the method against false\npositives and to eliminate low confidence detections, HM-Net employs novel\nfeedback filters and advanced data augmentations.

These methods involve transforming an initial time series\ndata set into one or more networks, which can be analyzed in depth to provide\ninsight into the original time series. This review provides a comprehensive\noverview of existing mapping methods for transforming time series into networks\nfor a wide audience of researchers and practitioners in machine learning, data\nmining and time series. Our main contribution is a structured review of\nexisting methodologies, identifying their main characteristics and their\ndifferences. We describe the main conceptual approaches, provide authoritative\nreferences and give insight into their advantages and limitations in a unified\nnotation and language. We first describe the case of univariate time series,\nwhich can be mapped to single layer networks, and we divide the current\nmappings based on the underlying concept: visibility, transition and proximity.\nWe then proceed with multivariate time series discussing both single layer and\nmultiple layer approaches.

Usually, these features are obtained from structural\ncharacteristics of time series, such as trend, seasonality and autocorrelation,\nsometimes requiring data transformations and parametric models. A recent\nconceptual approach relies on time series mapping to complex networks, where\nthe network science methodologies can help characterize time series. In this\npaper, we consider two mapping concepts, visibility and transition probability\nand propose network topological measures as a new set of time series features.\nTo evaluate the usefulness of the proposed features, we address the problem of\ntime series clustering. More specifically, we propose a clustering method that\nconsists in mapping the time series into visibility graphs and quantile graphs,\ncalculating global topological metrics of the resulting networks, and using\ndata mining techniques to form clusters. We apply this method to a data sets of\nsynthetic and empirical time series. The results indicate that network-based\nfeatures capture the information encoded in each of the time series models,\nresulting in high accuracy in a clustering task.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has led to many promising\nresults on a range of challenging decision-making tasks.

On the other hand, fast\nhuman-like adaptive control methods can optimize complex robotic interactions,\nyet fail to integrate multimodal feedback needed for unstructured tasks. In\nthis work, we propose to factor the learning problem in a hierarchical learning\nand adaption architecture to get the best of both worlds. The framework\nconsists of two components, a slow reinforcement learning policy optimizing the\ntask strategy given multimodal observations, and a fast, real-time adaptive\ncontrol policy continuously optimizing the motion, stability, and effort of the\nmanipulator. We combine these components through a bio-inspired action space\nthat we call AFORCE.

Contextual bandit (CB)\nalgorithms strive to make a good trade-off between exploration and exploitation\nso that users' potential interests have chances to expose. However, classical\nCB algorithms can only be applied to a small, sampled item set (usually\nhundreds), which forces the typical applications in recommender systems limited\nto candidate post-ranking, homepage top item ranking, ad creative selection, or\nonline model selection (A/B test).\nIn this paper, we introduce two simple but effective hierarchical CB\nalgorithms to make a classical CB model (such as LinUCB and Thompson Sampling)\ncapable to explore users' interest in the entire item space without limiting it\nto a small item set. We first construct a hierarchy item tree via a bottom-up\nclustering algorithm to organize items in a coarse-to-fine manner. Then we\npropose a hierarchical CB (HCB) algorithm to explore users' interest in the\nhierarchy tree. HCB takes the exploration problem as a series of\ndecision-making processes, where the goal is to find a path from the root to a\nleaf node, and the feedback will be back-propagated to all the nodes in the\npath. We further propose a progressive hierarchical CB (pHCB) algorithm, which\nprogressively extends visible nodes which reach a confidence level for\nexploration, to avoid misleading actions on upper-level nodes in the sequential\ndecision-making process.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is able to manage edge devices to cooperatively train\na model while maintaining the training data local and private. One common\nassumption in FL is that all edge devices share the same machine learning model\nin training, for example, identical neural network architecture. However, the\ncomputation and store capability of different devices may not be the same.\nMoreover, reducing communication overheads can improve the training efficiency\nthough it is still a challenging problem in FL. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel FL method, called FedHe, inspired by knowledge distillation, which can\ntrain heterogeneous models and support asynchronous training processes with\nsignificantly reduced communication overheads. Our analysis and experimental\nresults demonstrate that the performance of our proposed method is better than\nthe state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of communication overheads and model\naccuracy.",

With virtualization, post (reactive) migration of virtual\nmachines after allocation is the traditional way for load balancing and\nconsolidation. However, reactive migration is not easy to obtain predefined\nload balance objectives and may interrupt services and bring instability.\nTherefore, we provide a new approach, called Prepartition, for load balancing.\nIt partitions a VM request into a few sub-requests sequentially with start\ntime, end time and capacity demands, and treats each sub-request as a regular\nVM request. In this way, it can proactively set a bound for each VM request on\neach physical machine and makes the scheduler get ready before VM migration to\nobtain the predefined load balancing goal, which supports the resource\nallocation in a fine-grained manner. Simulations with real-world trace and\nsynthetic data show that Prepartition for offline (PrepartitionOff) scheduling\nhas 10%-20% better performance than the existing load balancing algorithms\nunder several metrics, including average utilization, imbalance degree,\nmakespan and Capacity_makespan.

The main reason is that\npast designs for replicated KV stores favor reducing network traffic and\nincreasing I/O size. Therefore, they perform costly compactions to reorganize\ndata in both the primary and backup nodes, which hurts overall system\nperformance.\nIn this paper, we design and implement Talos, an efficient rack-scale\nLSM-based KV store that aims to significantly reduce the I/O amplification and\nCPU overhead in backup nodes and make replication in the KV store practical. We\nrely on two observations: (a) the increased use of RDMA in the datacenter,\nwhich reduces CPU overhead for communication, and (b) the use of KV separation\nthat is becoming prevalent in modern KV stores. We use a primary-backup\nreplication scheme that performs compactions only on the primary nodes and\nsends the pre-built index to the backup nodes of the region, avoiding all\ncompactions in backups. Our approach includes an efficient mechanism to deal\nwith pointer translation across nodes in the region index. Our results show\nthat Talos reduces in the backup nodes, I/O amplification by up to $3\\times$,\nCPU overhead by up to $1.6\\times$, and memory size needed for the write path by\nup to $2\\times$, without increasing network bandwidth excessively, and by up to\n$1.3\\times$. Overall, we show that our approach has benefits even when small KV\npairs dominate in a workload (80%-90%).

Domain\nshift can lead to substantially degraded performance unless shifts are\nwell-exercised within the available training environments. We introduce a\nsimple robust estimation criterion -- transfer risk -- that is specifically\ngeared towards optimizing transfer to new environments. Effectively, the\ncriterion amounts to finding a representation that minimizes the risk of\napplying any optimal predictor trained on one environment to another. The\ntransfer risk essentially decomposes into two terms, a direct transfer term and\na weighted gradient-matching term arising from the optimality of\nper-environment predictors.

It has also been postulated that the ability to rapidly\nconstruct novel abstractions is critical to being able to solve analogical\nproblems. Given an image, the ability to construct a program that would\ngenerate that image is one form of abstraction, as exemplified in the\nDreamcoder project. In this paper, we present a preliminary examination of\nwhether programs constructed by Dreamcoder can be used for analogical reasoning\nto solve certain Bongard problems. We use Dreamcoder to discover programs that\ngenerate the images in a Bongard problem and represent each of these as a\nsequence of state transitions.

We use inductive logic programming (ILP), to learn an\n(interpretable) theory for the abstract concept involved in an instance of a\nBongard problem. Experiments on synthetically created Bongard problems for\nconcepts such as 'above/below' and 'clockwise/counterclockwise' demonstrate\nthat our end-to-end system can solve such problems.

    "title": "Exploring the Gap between Tolerant and Non-tolerant Distribution Testing",
    "abstract": "The framework of distribution testing is currently ubiquitous in the field of\nproperty testing. In this model, the input is a probability distribution\naccessible via independently drawn samples from an oracle. The testing task is\nto distinguish a distribution that satisfies some property from a distribution\nthat is far from satisfying it in the $\\ell_1$ distance. The task of tolerant\ntesting imposes a further restriction, that distributions close to satisfying\nthe property are also accepted. This work focuses on the connection of the\nsample complexities of non-tolerant (\"traditional\") testing of distributions\nand tolerant testing thereof. When limiting our scope to label-invariant\n(symmetric) properties of distribution, we prove that the gap is at most\nquadratic. Conversely, the property of being the uniform distribution is indeed\nknown to have an almost-quadratic gap. When moving to general, not necessarily\nlabel-invariant properties, the situation is more complicated, and we show some\npartial results. We show that if a property requires the distributions to be\nnon-concentrated, then it cannot be non-tolerantly tested with $o(\\sqrt{n})$\nmany samples, where $n$ denotes the universe size. Clearly, this implies at\nmost a quadratic gap, because a distribution can be learned (and hence\ntolerantly tested against any property) using $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ many samples.\nBeing non-concentrated is a strong requirement on the property, as we also\nprove a close to linear lower bound against their tolerant tests. To provide\nevidence for other general cases (where the properties are not necessarily\nlabel-invariant), we show that if an input distribution is very concentrated,\nin the sense that it is mostly supported on a subset of size $s$ of the\nuniverse, then it can be learned using only $\\mathcal{O}(s)$ many samples. The\nlearning procedure adapts to the input, and works without knowing $s$ in\nadvance.",

    "abstract": "Generalizing federated learning (FL) models to unseen clients with non-iid\ndata is a crucial topic, yet unsolved so far. In this work, we propose to\ntackle this problem from a novel causal perspective. Specifically, we form a\ntraining structural causal model (SCM) to explain the challenges of model\ngeneralization in a distributed learning paradigm. Based on this, we present a\nsimple yet effective method using test-specific and momentum tracked batch\nnormalization (TsmoBN) to generalize FL models to testing clients. We give a\ncausal analysis by formulating another testing SCM and demonstrate that the key\nfactor in TsmoBN is the test-specific statistics (i.e., mean and variance) of\nfeatures. Such statistics can be seen as a surrogate variable for causal\nintervention. In addition, by considering generalization bounds in FL, we show\nthat our TsmoBN method can reduce divergence between training and testing\nfeature distributions, which achieves a lower generalization gap than standard\nmodel testing. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate significant\nimprovements for unseen client generalization on three datasets with various\ntypes of feature distributions and numbers of clients. It is worth noting that\nour proposed approach can be flexibly applied to different state-of-the-art\nfederated learning algorithms and is orthogonal to existing domain\ngeneralization methods.",

    "abstract": "The joint transmission scheme of polar codes and sparse code multiple access\n(SCMA) has been regarded as a promising technology for future wireless\ncommunication systems. However, most of the existing polar-coded SCMA (PC-SCMA)\nsystems suffer from high latency caused by the feedback iteration and list\ndecoding. In addition, the error performance of PC-SCMA systems is\nunsatisfactory for ultra-reliable transmission. Inspired by the compelling\nbenefits of non-binary polar codes, in this paper, we design a non-binary\npolar-coded SCMA (NB-PC-SCMA) system with a free order matching strategy to\naddress the issues of delay and reliability. Specifically, we first formulate a\njoint factor graph for NB-PC-SCMA and propose a non-binary successive\ncancellation list (NB-SCL) and damping based joint iterative detection and\ndecoding (NSD-JIDD) multiuser receiver to improve the BER and latency\nperformance. Then, a lazy-search based NB-SCL (L-NB-SCL) decoding is proposed\nto reduce the computational complexity by modifying the path search pattern of\nthe list decoder. After that, we optimize the update of user nodes for SCMA\ndetection to improve the convergence error and finally propose the optimized\nNSD-JIDD (OSD-JIDD) algorithm, which can avoid redundant operations by\nexploiting L-NB-SCL decoding. Simulation results show that the proposed\nNB-PC-SCMA system achieves better bit error rate (BER) performance and\nconsiderable latency gain when compared to its counterparts. In particular, the\nproposed OSD-JIDD can achieve similar BER performance of NSD-JIDD with less\ncomplexity.",

    "abstract": "A knowledge graph (KG) is a data structure which represents entities and\nrelations as the vertices and edges of a directed graph with edge types. KGs\nare an important primitive in modern machine learning and artificial\nintelligence. Embedding-based models, such as the seminal TransE [Bordes et\nal., 2013] and the recent PairRE [Chao et al., 2020] are among the most popular\nand successful approaches for representing KGs and inferring missing edges\n(link completion). Their relative success is often credited in the literature\nto their ability to learn logical rules between the relations.\nIn this work, we investigate whether learning rules between relations is\nindeed what drives the performance of embedding-based methods. We define motif\nlearning and two alternative mechanisms, network learning (based only on the\nconnectivity of the KG, ignoring the relation types), and unstructured\nstatistical learning (ignoring the connectivity of the graph). Using\nexperiments on synthetic KGs, we show that KG models can learn motifs and how\nthis ability is degraded by non-motif (noise) edges. We propose tests to\ndistinguish the contributions of the three mechanisms to performance, and apply\nthem to popular KG benchmarks.

    "title": "Towards Optimal Correlational Object Search",
    "abstract": "In realistic applications of object search, robots will need to locate target\nobjects in complex environments while coping with unreliable sensors,\nespecially for small or hard-to-detect objects. In such settings, correlational\ninformation can be valuable for planning efficiently: when looking for a fork,\nthe robot could start by locating the easier-to-detect refrigerator, since\nforks would probably be found nearby. Previous approaches to object search with\ncorrelational information typically resort to ad-hoc or greedy search\nstrategies. In this paper, we propose the Correlational Object Search POMDP\n(COS-POMDP), which can be solved to produce search strategies that use\ncorrelational information. COS-POMDPs contain a correlation-based observation\nmodel that allows us to avoid the exponential blow-up of maintaining a joint\nbelief about all objects, while preserving the optimal solution to this naive,\nexponential POMDP formulation. We propose a hierarchical planning algorithm to\nscale up COS-POMDP for practical domains. We conduct experiments using\nAI2-THOR, a realistic simulator of household environments, as well as YOLOv5, a\nwidely-used object detector. Our results show that, particularly for\nhard-to-detect objects, such as scrub brush and remote control, our method\noffers the most robust performance compared to baselines that ignore\ncorrelations as well as a greedy, next-best view approach.",

In this\nwork, we introduce multiple QA systems that combine in novel ways the BM25\nalgorithm, a sparse retrieval technique, with PTT5, a pre-trained\nstate-of-the-art language model. Our QA systems focus on the Portuguese\nlanguage, thus offering resources not found elsewhere in the literature.

We thus\ncontribute with innovative architectures and novel applications, attaining an\nF1-score of 36.2 with our best model.",

    "abstract": "Learning optimal behavior from existing data is one of the most important\nproblems in Reinforcement Learning (RL). This is known as \"off-policy control\"\nin RL where an agent's objective is to compute an optimal policy based on the\ndata obtained from the given policy (known as the behavior policy). As the\noptimal policy can be very different from the behavior policy, learning optimal\nbehavior is very hard in the \"off-policy\" setting compared to the \"on-policy\"\nsetting where new data from the policy updates will be utilized in learning.\nThis work proposes an off-policy natural actor-critic algorithm that utilizes\nstate-action distribution correction for handling the off-policy behavior and\nthe natural policy gradient for sample efficiency. The existing natural\ngradient-based actor-critic algorithms with convergence guarantees require\nfixed features for approximating both policy and value functions. This often\nleads to sub-optimal learning in many RL applications. On the other hand, our\nproposed algorithm utilizes compatible features that enable one to use\narbitrary neural networks to approximate the policy and the value function and\nguarantee convergence to a locally optimal policy. We illustrate the benefit of\nthe proposed off-policy natural gradient algorithm by comparing it with the\nvanilla gradient actor-critic algorithm on benchmark RL tasks.",

Although the name is new (and\ncontested (Field, 2021)), the term describes existing types of algorithmic\nmodels that are \"trained on broad data at scale\" and \"fine-tuned\" (i.e.,\nadapted) for particular downstream tasks, and is intended to encompass large\nlanguage models such as BERT or GPT-3 and computer vision models such as CLIP.\nSuch technologies have the potential for harm broadly speaking (e.g., Bender et\nal., 2021), but their use in the educational domain is particularly fraught,\ndespite the potential benefits for learners claimed by the authors. In section\n3.3 of the Stanford report, Malik et al. argue that achieving the goal of\nproviding education for all learners requires more efficient computational\napproaches that can rapidly scale across educational domains and across\neducational contexts, for which they argue foundation models are uniquely\nwell-suited.

    "abstract": "Soft grippers are receiving growing attention due to their compliance-based\ninteractive safety and dexterity. Hybrid gripper (soft actuators enhanced by\nrigid constraints) is a new trend in soft gripper design. With right structural\ncomponents actuated by soft actuators, they could achieve excellent grasping\nadaptability and payload, while also being easy to model and control with\nconventional kinematics. However, existing works were mostly focused on\nachieving superior payload and perception with simple planar workspaces,\nresulting in far less dexterity compared with conventional grippers. In this\nwork, we took inspiration from the human Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint and\nproposed a new hybrid gripper design with 8 independent muscles. It was shown\nthat adding the MCP complexity was critical in enabling a range of novel\nfeatures in the hybrid gripper, including in-hand manipulation, lateral passive\ncompliance, as well as new control modes. A prototype gripper was fabricated\nand tested on our proprietary dual-arm robot platform with vision guided\ngrasping. With very lightweight pneumatic bellows soft actuators, the gripper\ncould grasp objects over 25 times its own weight with lateral compliance. Using\nthe dual-arm platform, highly anthropomorphic dexterous manipulations were\ndemonstrated using two hybrid grippers, from Tug-of-war on a rigid rod, to\npassing a soft towel between two grippers using in-hand manipulation. Matching\nwith the novel features and performance specifications of the proposed hybrid\ngripper, the underlying modeling, actuation, control, and experimental\nvalidation details were also presented, offering a promising approach to\nachieving enhanced dexterity, strength, and compliance in robotic grippers.",

    "abstract": "Idiomatic expressions are an integral part of natural language and constantly\nbeing added to a language. Owing to their non-compositionality and their\nability to take on a figurative or literal meaning depending on the sentential\ncontext, they have been a classical challenge for NLP systems. To address this\nchallenge, we study the task of detecting whether a sentence has an idiomatic\nexpression and localizing it. Prior art for this task had studied specific\nclasses of idiomatic expressions offering limited views of their\ngeneralizability to new idioms. We propose a multi-stage neural architecture\nwith the attention flow mechanism for identifying these expressions. The\nnetwork effectively fuses contextual and lexical information at different\nlevels using word and sub-word representations. Empirical evaluations on three\nof the largest benchmark datasets with idiomatic expressions of varied\nsyntactic patterns and degrees of non-compositionality show that our proposed\nmodel achieves new state-of-the-art results. A salient feature of the model is\nits ability to identify idioms unseen during training with gains from 1.4% to\n30.8% over competitive baselines on the largest dataset.",

To compare continual RL methods on these benchmarks,\nwe prepare three metrics in CORA: continual evaluation, forgetting, and\nzero-shot forward transfer.

    "abstract": "Random Forests (RF) are among the state-of-the-art in many machine learning\napplications. With the ongoing integration of ML models into everyday life, the\ndeployment and continuous application of models becomes more and more an\nimportant issue. Hence, small models which offer good predictive performance\nbut use small amounts of memory are required. Ensemble pruning is a standard\ntechnique to remove unnecessary classifiers from an ensemble to reduce the\noverall resource consumption and sometimes even improve the performance of the\noriginal ensemble. In this paper, we revisit ensemble pruning in the context of\n`modernly' trained Random Forests where trees are very large. We show that the\nimprovement effects of pruning diminishes for ensembles of large trees but that\npruning has an overall better accuracy-memory trade-off than RF. However,\npruning does not offer fine-grained control over this trade-off because it\nremoves entire trees from the ensemble. To further improve the accuracy-memory\ntrade-off we present a simple, yet surprisingly effective algorithm that\nrefines the predictions in the leaf nodes in the forest via stochastic gradient\ndescent. We evaluate our method against 7 state-of-the-art pruning methods and\nshow that our method outperforms the other methods on 11 of 16 datasets with a\nstatistically significant better accuracy-memory trade-off compared to most\nmethods. We conclude our experimental evaluation with a case study showing that\nour method can be applied in a real-world setting.",

    "abstract": "We study off-policy evaluation and learning from sequential data in a\nstructured class of Markov decision processes that arise from repeated\ninteractions with an exogenous sequence of arrivals with contexts, which\ngenerate unknown individual-level responses to agent actions. This model can be\nthought of as an offline generalization of contextual bandits with resource\nconstraints. We formalize the relevant causal structure of problems such as\ndynamic personalized pricing and other operations management problems in the\npresence of potentially high-dimensional user types. The key insight is that an\nindividual-level response is often not causally affected by the state variable\nand can therefore easily be generalized across timesteps and states. When this\nis true, we study implications for (doubly robust) off-policy evaluation and\nlearning by instead leveraging single time-step evaluation, estimating the\nexpectation over a single arrival via data from a population, for fitted-value\niteration in a marginal MDP. We study sample complexity and analyze error\namplification that leads to the persistence, rather than attenuation, of\nconfounding error over time.

    "abstract": "Active inference is a unifying theory for perception and action resting upon\nthe idea that the brain maintains an internal model of the world by minimizing\nfree energy. From a behavioral perspective, active inference agents can be seen\nas self-evidencing beings that act to fulfill their optimistic predictions,\nnamely preferred outcomes or goals. In contrast, reinforcement learning\nrequires human-designed rewards to accomplish any desired outcome. Although\nactive inference could provide a more natural self-supervised objective for\ncontrol, its applicability has been limited because of the shortcomings in\nscaling the approach to complex environments. In this work, we propose a\ncontrastive objective for active inference that strongly reduces the\ncomputational burden in learning the agent's generative model and planning\nfuture actions. Our method performs notably better than likelihood-based active\ninference in image-based tasks, while also being computationally cheaper and\neasier to train. We compare to reinforcement learning agents that have access\nto human-designed reward functions, showing that our approach closely matches\ntheir performance. Finally, we also show that contrastive methods perform\nsignificantly better in the case of distractors in the environment and that our\nmethod is able to generalize goals to variations in the background.",

We provide refined variants of these attacks,\nconsiderably relaxing the requirements on adversarial stake and network timing,\nand thus rendering the attacks more severe. Combining techniques from both\nrefined attacks, we obtain a third attack which allows an adversary with\nvanishingly small fraction of stake and no control over network message\npropagation (assuming instead probabilistic message propagation) to cause even\nlong-range consensus chain reorganizations. Honest-but-rational or\nideologically motivated validators could use this attack to increase their\nprofits or stall the protocol, threatening incentive alignment and security of\nPoS Ethereum.

    "abstract": "The random order streaming model has been very fruitful for graph streams,\nallowing for polylogarithmic or even constant space estimators for fundamental\ngraph problems such as matching size estimation, counting the number of\nconnected components and more. However, the assumption that there are no\ncorrelations between the order of arrival of edges in the stream is quite\nstrong. In this paper we introduce (hidden) batch random order streams, where\nedges are grouped in \"batches\" (which are unknown to the algorithm) that arrive\nin a random order, as a natural framework for modelling hidden correlations in\nthe arrival order of edges, and present algorithms and lower bounds for this\nmodel.\nOn the algorithmic side, we show how known techniques for connected component\ncounting in constant space due to Peng and Sohler [SODA `18] easily translate\nfrom random order streams to our model with only a small loss in parameters.\nOur algorithm obtains an additive $\\varepsilon n$ approximation to the number\nof connected components in the input graph using space\n$(1/\\varepsilon)^{O(1/\\varepsilon)}$ by building a representative sample of\nvertices in the graph that belong to $O(1/\\varepsilon)$-size components to\nestimate the count.

This is because malicious clients can collude\nand send in carefully tailored model updates to make the global model\ninaccurate. This motivated the development of Byzantine-resilient federated\nlearning algorithms, such as Krum, Bulyan, FABA, and FoolsGold. However, a\nrecently developed untargeted model poisoning attack showed that all prior\ndefenses can be bypassed. The attack uses the intuition that simply by changing\nthe sign of the gradient updates that the optimizer is computing, for a set of\nmalicious clients, a model can be diverted from the optima to increase the test\nerror rate. In this work, we develop TESSERACT---a defense against this\ndirected deviation attack, a state-of-the-art model poisoning attack. TESSERACT\nis based on a simple intuition that in a federated learning setting, certain\npatterns of gradient flips are indicative of an attack. This intuition is\nremarkably stable across different learning algorithms, models, and datasets.\nTESSERACT assigns reputation scores to the participating clients based on their\nbehavior during the training phase and then takes a weighted contribution of\nthe clients.

We study both the soft-max and the Fisher-non-degenerate\npolicy parametrizations, and show that adding a momentum improves the global\noptimality sample complexity of vanilla PG methods by\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-1.5})$ and\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-1})$, respectively, where $\\epsilon>0$ is the\ntarget tolerance. Our work is the first one that obtains global convergence\nresults for the momentum-based PG methods. For the generic\nFisher-non-degenerate policy parametrizations, our result is the first\nsingle-loop and finite-batch PG algorithm achieving $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$\nglobal optimality sample complexity. Finally, as a by-product, our methods also\nprovide general framework for analyzing the global convergence rates of\nstochastic PG methods, which can be easily applied and extended to different PG\nestimators.",

    "abstract": "Entropy regularization is an efficient technique for encouraging exploration\nand preventing a premature convergence of (vanilla) policy gradient methods in\nreinforcement learning (RL). However, the theoretical understanding of entropy\nregularized RL algorithms has been limited. In this paper, we revisit the\nclassical entropy regularized policy gradient methods with the soft-max policy\nparametrization, whose convergence has so far only been established assuming\naccess to exact gradient oracles. To go beyond this scenario, we propose the\nfirst set of (nearly) unbiased stochastic policy gradient estimators with\ntrajectory-level entropy regularization, with one being an unbiased visitation\nmeasure-based estimator and the other one being a nearly unbiased yet more\npractical trajectory-based estimator. We prove that although the estimators\nthemselves are unbounded in general due to the additional logarithmic policy\nrewards introduced by the entropy term, the variances are uniformly bounded.\nThis enables the development of the first set of convergence results for\nstochastic entropy regularized policy gradient methods to both stationary\npoints and globally optimal policies.

Electricity tariff and DERs share a symbiotic\nrelationship whereby the design of the former directly impacts the economic\nefficiency and equity in the system. Current tariff design approaches suffer\nfrom opaque efficiency-equity trade-offs and are also agnostic of the\nexternalities that affect both economic efficiency and equity. Therefore, this\npaper develops a justice-cognizant tariff design framework that improves the\neconomic efficiency of tariff without sacrificing its distributional equity,\nand encompasses economic welfare, social costs of environmental and public\nhealth impacts, and socio-economic and demographic characteristics of\nelectricity consumers. The proposed framework is based on a Single Leader\nSingle Follower (SLSF) game incorporating a multi-objective optimization\nproblem, and is evaluated on four different tariff structures. The SLSF game is\nreformulated as a Multi-Objective Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (MOPEC)\nand is solved by integrating the objective sum method for multi-objective\noptimization and Scholtes's relaxation technique for equilibrium constraints.\nWe compare the economic efficiency and equity of the proposed framework using\nthe 11-zone New York ISO and 7-bus Manhattan power networks. The results\ndemonstrate that spatially- and temporally-granular tariffs ensure equity and\neconomic efficiency at a lower energy burden to consumers.",

By analyzing the real-world PMU data, we\nfind it is challenging to directly use this dataset for event classifiers due\nto the low data quality observed in PMU measurements and event logs. To address\nthese challenges, we develop a novel machine learning framework for training\nrobust event classifiers, which consists of three main steps: data\npreprocessing, fine-grained event data extraction, and feature engineering.\nSpecifically, the data preprocessing step addresses the data quality issues of\nPMU measurements (e.g., bad data and missing data); in the fine-grained event\ndata extraction step, a model-free event detection method is developed to\naccurately localize the events from the inaccurate event timestamps in the\nevent logs; and the feature engineering step constructs the event features\nbased on the patterns of different event types, in order to improve the\nperformance and the interpretability of the event classifiers. Based on the\nproposed framework, we develop a workflow for event classification using the\nreal-world PMU data streaming into the system in real-time. Using the proposed\nframework, robust event classifiers can be efficiently trained based on many\noff-the-shelf lightweight machine learning models. Numerical experiments using\nthe real-world dataset from the Western Interconnection of the U.S power\ntransmission grid show that the event classifiers trained under the proposed\nframework can achieve high classification accuracy while being robust against\nlow-quality data.",

The\nidea is that attacker A first makes the user U connect to his website (or to a\nwell-known site the attacker controls) and transparently collects the\ninformation from U that is used for fingerprinting purposes. Then, A\norchestrates a browser on his own machine to replicate and transmit the same\nfingerprinting information when connecting to W, fooling W to think that U is\nthe one requesting the service rather than A. This will allow the attacker to\nprofile U and compromise U's privacy. We design and implement the Gummy\nBrowsers attack using three orchestration methods based on script injection,\nbrowser settings and debugging tools, and script modification, that can\nsuccessfully spoof a wide variety of fingerprinting features to mimic many\ndifferent browsers (including mobile browsers and the Tor browser).

The TPR (true positive rate) for the tracking of the benign user in the\npresence of the attack is larger than 0.9 in most cases. The FPR (false\npositive rate) for the tracking of the attacker is also high, larger than 0.9\nin all cases.

The non-determined experiments (signals) in the multi-phase\ntrial are to be chosen by the sender in order to persuade the receiver best.\nWith a binary state of the world, we start by deriving the optimal signaling\npolicy in the only non-trivial configuration of a two-phase trial with\nbinary-outcome experiments. We then generalize to multi-phase trials with\nbinary-outcome experiments where the determined experiments can be placed at\nany chosen node in the trial tree. Here we present a dynamic programming\nalgorithm to derive the optimal signaling policy that uses the two-phase trial\nsolution's structural insights. We also contrast the optimal signaling policy\nstructure with classical Bayesian persuasion strategies to highlight the impact\nof the signaling constraints on the sender.",

    "abstract": "Sampling and Variational Inference (VI) are two large families of methods for\napproximate inference with complementary strengths. Sampling methods excel at\napproximating arbitrary probability distributions, but can be inefficient. VI\nmethods are efficient, but can fail when probability distributions are complex.\nHere, we develop a framework for constructing intermediate algorithms that\nbalance the strengths of both sampling and VI. Both approximate a probability\ndistribution using a mixture of simple component distributions: in sampling,\neach component is a delta-function and is chosen stochastically, while in\nstandard VI a single component is chosen to minimize divergence. We show that\nsampling and VI emerge as special cases of an optimization problem over a\nmixing distribution, and intermediate approximations arise by varying a single\nparameter.

    "abstract": "Decision trees are important both as interpretable models amenable to\nhigh-stakes decision-making, and as building blocks of ensemble methods such as\nrandom forests and gradient boosting. Their statistical properties, however,\nare not well understood. The most cited prior works have focused on deriving\npointwise consistency guarantees for CART in a classical nonparametric\nregression setting. We take a different approach, and advocate studying the\ngeneralization performance of decision trees with respect to different\ngenerative regression models. This allows us to elicit their inductive bias,\nthat is, the assumptions the algorithms make (or do not make) to generalize to\nnew data, thereby guiding practitioners on when and how to apply these methods.\nIn this paper, we focus on sparse additive generative models, which have both\nlow statistical complexity and some nonparametric flexibility. We prove a sharp\nsquared error generalization lower bound for a large class of decision tree\nalgorithms fitted to sparse additive models with $C^1$ component functions.\nThis bound is surprisingly much worse than the minimax rate for estimating such\nsparse additive models. The inefficiency is due not to greediness, but to the\nloss in power for detecting global structure when we average responses solely\nover each leaf, an observation that suggests opportunities to improve\ntree-based algorithms, for example, by hierarchical shrinkage. To prove these\nbounds, we develop new technical machinery, establishing a novel connection\nbetween decision tree estimation and rate-distortion theory, a sub-field of\ninformation theory.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether a deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) with an attention module can detect\nosteoporosis on panoramic radiographs.\nStudy Design. A dataset of 70 panoramic radiographs (PRs) from 70 different\nsubjects of age between 49 to 60 was used, including 49 subjects with\nosteoporosis and 21 normal subjects. We utilized the leave-one-out\ncross-validation approach to generate 70 training and test splits.\nSpecifically, for each split, one image was used for testing and the remaining\n69 images were used for training. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN)\nusing the Siamese architecture was implemented through a fine-tuning process to\nclassify an PR image using patches extracted from eight representative\ntrabecula bone areas (Figure 1). In order to automatically learn the importance\nof different PR patches, an attention module was integrated into the deep CNN.\nThree metrics, including osteoporosis accuracy (OPA), non-osteoporosis accuracy\n(NOPA) and overall accuracy (OA), were utilized for performance evaluation.\nResults. The proposed baseline CNN approach achieved the OPA, NOPA and OA\nscores of 0.667, 0.878 and 0.814, respectively. With the help of the attention\nmodule, the OPA, NOPA and OA scores were further improved to 0.714, 0.939 and\n0.871, respectively.\nConclusions.

It has long\nbeen a recognized problem that many datasets contain significant levels of\nmissing numerical data. We introduce a mathematically principled stochastic\noptimization imputation method based on the theory of Kriging. This is shown to\nbe a powerful method for imputation. However, its computational effort and\npotential numerical instabilities produce costly and/or unreliable predictions,\npotentially limiting its use on large scale datasets. In this paper, we apply a\nrecently developed multi-level stochastic optimization approach to the problem\nof imputation in massive medical records. The approach is based on\ncomputational applied mathematics techniques and is highly accurate. In\nparticular, for the Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (BLUP) this multi-level\nformulation is exact, and is also significantly faster and more numerically\nstable. This permits practical application of Kriging methods to data\nimputation problems for massive datasets. We test this approach on data from\nthe National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data records, Healthcare Cost and\nUtilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\nNumerical results show the multi-level method significantly outperforms current\napproaches and is numerically robust. In particular, it has superior accuracy\nas compared with methods recommended in the recent report from HCUP on the\nimportant problem of missing data, which could lead to sub-optimal and poorly\nbased funding policy decisions. In comparative benchmark tests it is shown that\nthe multilevel stochastic method is significantly superior to recommended\nmethods in the report, including Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) and Predicted\nPosterior Distribution (PPD), with up to 75% reductions in error.",

With industrial processes becoming\nmore and more complex and integrated, binary variables also appear in\nmonitoring variables besides continuous variables, which makes process\nmonitoring more challenging. The aforementioned traditional approaches are\nincompetent to mine the information of binary variables, so that the useful\ninformation contained in them is usually discarded during the data\npreprocessing. To solve the problem, this paper focuses on the issue of hybrid\nvariable monitoring (HVM) and proposes a novel unsupervised framework of\nprocess monitoring with hybrid variables. HVM is addressed in the probabilistic\nframework, which can effectively exploit the process information implicit in\nboth continuous and binary variables at the same time. In HVM, the statistics\nand the monitoring strategy suitable for hybrid variables with only healthy\nstate data are defined and the physical explanation behind the framework is\nelaborated. In addition, the estimation of parameters required in HVM is\nderived in detail and the detectable condition of the proposed method is\nanalyzed.

    "abstract": "The Frank Wolfe algorithm (FW) is a popular projection-free alternative for\nsolving large-scale constrained optimization problems. However, the FW\nalgorithm suffers from a sublinear convergence rate when minimizing a smooth\nconvex function over a compact convex set. Thus, exploring techniques that\nyield a faster convergence rate becomes crucial. A classic approach to obtain\nfaster rates is to combine previous iterates to obtain the next iterate. In\nthis work, we extend this approach to the FW setting and show that the optimal\nway to combine the past iterates is using a set of orthogonal Jacobi\npolynomials. We also a polynomial-based acceleration technique, referred to as\nJacobi polynomial accelerated FW, which combines the current iterate with the\npast iterate using combing weights related to the Jacobi recursion. By\ncarefully choosing parameters of the Jacobi polynomials, we obtain a faster\nsublinear convergence rate. We provide numerical experiments on real datasets\nto demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Spectral unmixing (SU) expresses the mixed pixels existed in hyperspectral\nimages as the product of endmember and abundance, which has been widely used in\nhyperspectral imagery analysis. However, the influence of light, acquisition\nconditions and the inherent properties of materials, results in that the\nidentified endmembers can vary spectrally within a given image (construed as\nspectral variability). To address this issue, recent methods usually use a\npriori obtained spectral library to represent multiple characteristic spectra\nof the same object, but few of them extracted the spectral variability\nexplicitly. In this paper, a spectral variability augmented sparse unmixing\nmodel (SVASU) is proposed, in which the spectral variability is extracted for\nthe first time. The variable spectra are divided into two parts of intrinsic\nspectrum and spectral variability for spectral reconstruction, and modeled\nsynchronously in the SU model adding the regular terms restricting the sparsity\nof abundance and the generalization of the variability coefficient. It is noted\nthat the spectral variability library and the intrinsic spectral library are\nall constructed from the In-situ observed image. Experimental results over both\nsynthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that the augmented decomposition\nby spectral variability significantly improves the unmixing performance than\nthe decomposition only by spectral library, as well as compared to\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.",

Under the assumption that structured data vary smoothly over a graph,\nthe problem can be formulated as a regularised convex optimisation over a\npositive semidefinite cone and solved by iterative algorithms. Classic methods\nrequire an explicit convex function to reflect generic topological priors, e.g.\nthe $\\ell_1$ penalty for enforcing sparsity, which limits the flexibility and\nexpressiveness in learning rich topological structures.

Experiments on voice conversion tasks demonstrate\nthat this simple technique can effectively reduce mutual information among\nindividual factors, and produce clearly better conversion than the IB-based\nSpeechFlow. CycleFlow can also be used as a powerful tool for speech editing.\nWe demonstrate this usage by an emotion perception experiment.",

This paper\nformalizes this task as the cocktail fork problem, and presents the Divide and\nRemaster (DnR) dataset to foster research on this topic. DnR is built from\nthree well-established audio datasets (LibriVox, FMA, FSD50k), taking care to\nreproduce conditions similar to professionally produced content in terms of\nsource overlap and relative loudness, and made available at CD quality. We\nbenchmark standard source separation algorithms on DnR, and further introduce a\nnew mixed-STFT-resolution model to better address the variety of acoustic\ncharacteristics of the three source types.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel SSL approach named SleepPriorCL to alleviate the above problem.\nAdvances of our approach over existing SSL methods are two-fold: 1) by\nincorporating prior domain knowledge into the training regime of SSL, more\nsemantically similar positives are discovered without accessing ground-truth\nlabels; 2) via investigating the influence of the temperature in contrastive\nloss, an adaptive temperature mechanism for each sample according to prior\ndomain knowledge is further proposed, leading to better performance.

The goal is to\nmaximize the sum UL-DL spectral efficiency (SE). We theoretically establish the\nsub-modularity of the sum SE, which allows us to develop a new, low complexity,\ngreedy algorithm for the combinatorial AP scheduling problem, with guaranteed\noptimality properties. We also consider pilot sequence reuse among the UEs to\nlimit the channel estimation overhead. In CF systems, all the APs estimate the\nchannel from every UE, making pilot allocation problem different from the\ncellular case. We develop a novel algorithm that iteratively minimizes the\nmaximum pilot contamination across the UEs. We compare our solutions, both\ntheoretically and via simulations, against a full duplex (FD) multi-cell mMIMO\nsystem. Our results show that, due to the joint processing of the signals at\nthe central processing unit, CF-mMIMO with dynamic HD AP-scheduling\nsignificantly outperforms cellular FD-mMIMO in terms of the sum SE and 90%\nlikely SE.

    "abstract": "Full-duplex (FD) systems have been introduced to provide high data rates for\nbeyond fifth-generation wireless networks through simultaneous transmission of\ninformation over the same frequency resources. However, the operation of FD\nsystems is practically limited by the self-interference (SI), and efficient SI\ncancelers are sought to make the FD systems realizable. Typically,\npolynomial-based cancelers are employed to mitigate the SI; nevertheless, they\nsuffer from high complexity. This article proposes two novel hybrid-layers\nneural network (NN) architectures to cancel the SI with low complexity. The\nfirst architecture is referred to as hybrid-convolutional recurrent NN (HCRNN),\nwhereas the second is termed as hybrid-convolutional recurrent dense NN\n(HCRDNN). In contrast to the state-of-the-art NNs that employ dense or\nrecurrent layers for SI modeling, the proposed NNs exploit, in a novel manner,\na combination of different hidden layers (e.g., convolutional, recurrent,\nand/or dense) in order to model the SI with lower computational complexity than\nthe polynomial and the state-of-the-art NN-based cancelers. The key idea behind\nusing hybrid layers is to build an NN model, which makes use of the\ncharacteristics of the different layers employed in its architecture. More\nspecifically, in the HCRNN, a convolutional layer is employed to extract the\ninput data features using a reduced network scale. Moreover, a recurrent layer\nis then applied to assist in learning the temporal behavior of the input signal\nfrom the localized feature map of the convolutional layer. In the HCRDNN, an\nadditional dense layer is exploited to add another degree of freedom for\nadapting the NN settings in order to achieve the best compromise between the\ncancellation performance and computational complexity. Complexity analysis and\nnumerical simulations are provided to prove the superiority of the proposed\narchitectures.",

We investigate three update rules -- the replicator\ndynamics (RD), the best response (BR), and the unconditional imitation (UI) --\nfor coordination games on random graphs. Local effects turn out to me\nsignificantly more important for the UI update rule. For the pure coordination\ngame with two equivalent strategies we find a transition from a disordered\nstate to a state of full coordination for a critical value of the network\nconnectivity. The transition is system-size-independent for the BR and RD\nupdate rules. For the IU update rule it is system size dependent, but\ncoordination can always be reached below the connectivity of a complete graph.\nWe also consider the general coordination game which covers a range of games,\nsuch as the stag hunt. For these games there is a payoff-dominant strategy and\na risk-dominant strategy with associated states of equilibrium coordination. We\nanalyse equilibrium selection analytically and numerically. For the RD and BR\nupdate rules mean-field predictions agree with simulations and the\nrisk-dominant strategy is evolutionary favoured independently of local effects.\nWhen players use the unconditional imitation, however, we observe coordination\nin the payoff-dominant strategy. Surprisingly, the selection of pay-off\ndominant equilibrium only occurs below a critical value of the network\nconnectivity and it disappears in complete graphs.

    "abstract": "We study a simplified model of the representation of colors in the primate\nprimary cortical visual area V1. The model is described by an initial value\nproblem related to a Hammerstein equation. The solutions to this problem\nrepresent the variation of the activity of populations of neurons in V1 as a\nfunction of space and color. The two space variables describe the spatial\nextent of the cortex while the two color variables describe the hue and the\nsaturation represented at every location in the cortex. We prove the\nwell-posedness of the initial value problem. We focus on its stationary, i.e.\nindependent of time, and periodic in space solutions. We show that the model\nequation is equivariant with respect to the direct product G of the group of\nthe Euclidean transformations of the planar lattice determined by the spatial\nperiodicity and the group of color transformations, isomorphic to O(2), and\nstudy the equivariant bifurcations of its stationary solutions when some\nparameters in the model vary. Their variations may be caused by the consumption\nof drugs and the bifurcated solutions may represent visual hallucinations in\nspace and color. Some of the bifurcated solutions can be determined by applying\nthe Equivariant Branching Lemma (EBL) by determining the axial subgroups of G .\nThese define bifurcated solutions which are invariant under the action of the\ncorresponding axial subgroup. We compute analytically these solutions and\nillustrate them as color images. Using advanced methods of numerical\nbifurcation analysis we then explore the persistence and stability of these\nsolutions when varying some parameters in the model. We conjecture that we can\nrely on the EBL to predict the existence of patterns that survive in large\nparameter domains but not to predict their stability. On our way we discover\nthe existence of spatially localized stable patterns through the phenomenon of\n\"snaking\".",

The traditional one-hot encoding, where\neach category is represented by a dummy variable, can be wasteful, difficult to\ninterpret, and prone to overfitting, especially when dealing with\nhigh-cardinality categorical predictors. This paper addresses these challenges\nby finding a reduced representation of the categorical predictors by clustering\ntheir categories. This is done through a numerical method which aims to\npreserve (or even, improve) accuracy, while reducing the number of coefficients\nto be estimated for the categorical predictors. Thanks to its design, we are\nable to derive a proximity measure between categories of a categorical\npredictor that can be easily visualized.

In this context, a numerical scheme was\ndeveloped to solve a system of complex partial differential equations (CPDE)\nthat describes the propagation of solitons in optical fibers with loss and\nnonlinear amplification mechanisms. The numerical procedure is based on the\nmathematical theory of Taylor series of complex functions. We adapted the\nFinite Difference Method (FDM) to approximate derivatives of complex functions.\nThen, we solve the algebraic system resulting from the discretization,\nimplicitly, through the relaxation Gauss-Seidel method (RGSM). The numerical\nstudy of CPDE system with linear and cubic attenuation showed that soliton\nwaves undergo attenuation, dispersion, and oscillation effects. On the other\nhand, we find that by considering the nonlinear term (cubic term) as an optical\namplification, it is possible to partially compensate for the attenuation of\nthe optical signal. Finally, we show that a gain of 9% triples the propagation\ndistance of the fundamental soliton wave, when the dissipation rate is 1%.",

    "title": "Deep Learning to Estimate Permeability using Geophysical Data",
    "abstract": "Time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is a popular geophysical\nmethod to estimate three-dimensional (3D) permeability fields from electrical\npotential difference measurements. Traditional inversion and data assimilation\nmethods are used to ingest this ERT data into hydrogeophysical models to\nestimate permeability. Due to ill-posedness and the curse of dimensionality,\nexisting inversion strategies provide poor estimates and low resolution of the\n3D permeability field. Recent advances in deep learning provide us with\npowerful algorithms to overcome this challenge. This paper presents a deep\nlearning (DL) framework to estimate the 3D subsurface permeability from\ntime-lapse ERT data. To test the feasibility of the proposed framework, we\ntrain DL-enabled inverse models on simulation data. Subsurface process models\nbased on hydrogeophysics are used to generate this synthetic data for deep\nlearning analyses. Results show that proposed weak supervised learning can\ncapture salient spatial features in the 3D permeability field. Quantitatively,\nthe average mean squared error (in terms of the natural log) on the strongly\nlabeled training, validation, and test datasets is less than 0.5. The R2-score\n(global metric) is greater than 0.75, and the percent error in each cell (local\nmetric) is less than 10%. Finally, an added benefit in terms of computational\ncost is that the proposed DL-based inverse model is at least O(104) times\nfaster than running a forward model. Note that traditional inversion may\nrequire multiple forward model simulations (e.g., in the order of 10 to 1000),\nwhich are very expensive. This computational savings (O(105) - O(107)) makes\nthe proposed DL-based inverse model attractive for subsurface imaging and\nreal-time ERT monitoring applications due to fast and yet reasonably accurate\nestimations of the permeability field.",

    "abstract": "The theory-guided convolutional neural network (TgCNN) framework, which can\nincorporate discretized governing equation residuals into the training of\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs), is extended to two-phase porous media\nflow problems in this work. The two principal variables of the considered\nproblem, pressure and saturation, are approximated simultaneously with two\nCNNs, respectively. Pressure and saturation are coupled with each other in the\ngoverning equations, and thus the two networks are also mutually conditioned in\nthe training process by the discretized governing equations, which also\nincreases the difficulty of model training. The coupled and discretized\nequations can provide valuable information in the training process. With the\nassistance of theory-guidance, the TgCNN surrogates can achieve better accuracy\nthan ordinary CNN surrogates in two-phase flow problems. Moreover, a piecewise\ntraining strategy is proposed for the scenario with varying well controls, in\nwhich the TgCNN surrogates are constructed for different segments on the time\ndimension and stacked together to predict solutions for the whole time-span.\nFor scenarios with larger variance of the formation property field, the TgCNN\nsurrogates can also achieve satisfactory performance. The constructed TgCNN\nsurrogates are further used for inversion of permeability fields by combining\nthem with the iterative ensemble smoother (IES) algorithm, and sufficient\ninversion accuracy is obtained with improved efficiency.",

Rather, it implies the observed entries are very few, and even fewer\nwith the growth of the tensor; this is ubiquitous in practice. Compared with\nthe existent works, our model not only leverages the structural information\nunderlying the observed entry indices, but also provides extra interpretability\nand flexibility -- it can simultaneously estimate a set of location factors\nabout the intrinsic properties of the tensor nodes, and another set of\nsociability factors reflecting their extrovert activity in interacting with\nothers; users are free to choose a trade-off between the two types of factors.\nSpecifically, we use hierarchical Gamma processes and Poisson random measures\nto construct a tensor-valued process, which can freely sample the two types of\nfactors to generate tensors and always guarantees an asymptotic sparsity. We\nthen normalize the tensor process to obtain hierarchical Dirichlet processes to\nsample each observed entry index, and use a Gaussian process to sample the\nentry value as a nonlinear function of the factors, so as to capture both the\nsparse structure properties and complex node relationships. For efficient\ninference, we use Dirichlet process properties over finite sample partitions,\ndensity transformations, and random features to develop a stochastic\nvariational estimation algorithm.

    "abstract": "Conditional waveform synthesis models learn a distribution of audio waveforms\ngiven conditioning such as text, mel-spectrograms, or MIDI. These systems\nemploy deep generative models that model the waveform via either sequential\n(autoregressive) or parallel (non-autoregressive) sampling. Generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) have become a common choice for non-autoregressive\nwaveform synthesis. However, state-of-the-art GAN-based models produce\nartifacts when performing mel-spectrogram inversion. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that these artifacts correspond with an inability for the generator\nto learn accurate pitch and periodicity. We show that simple pitch and\nperiodicity conditioning is insufficient for reducing this error relative to\nusing autoregression. We discuss the inductive bias that autoregression\nprovides for learning the relationship between instantaneous frequency and\nphase, and show that this inductive bias holds even when autoregressively\nsampling large chunks of the waveform during each forward pass. Relative to\nprior state-of- the-art GAN-based models, our proposed model, Chunked\nAutoregressive GAN (CARGAN) reduces pitch error by 40-60%, reduces training\ntime by 58%, maintains a fast generation speed suitable for real-time or\ninteractive applications, and maintains or improves subjective quality.",
