    "abstract": "The severity of the coronavirus pandemic necessitates the need of effective\nadministrative decisions. Over 4 lakh people in India succumbed to COVID-19,\nwith over 3 crore confirmed cases, and still counting. The threat of a\nplausible third wave continues to haunt millions. In this ever changing dynamic\nof the virus, predictive modeling methods can serve as an integral tool. The\npandemic has further triggered an unprecedented usage of social media. This\npaper aims to propose a method for harnessing social media, specifically\nTwitter, to predict the upcoming scenarios related to COVID-19 cases. In this\nstudy, we seek to understand how the surges in COVID-19 related tweets can\nindicate rise in the cases. This prospective analysis can be utilised to aid\nadministrators about timely resource allocation to lessen the severity of the\ndamage. Using word embeddings to capture the semantic meaning of tweets, we\nidentify Significant Dimensions (SDs).Our methodology predicts the rise in\ncases with a lead time of 15 days and 30 days with R2 scores of 0.80 and 0.62\nrespectively. Finally, we explain the thematic utility of the SDs.",

    "abstract": "The radio access network (RAN) part of the next-generation wireless networks\nwill require efficient solutions for satisfying low latency and high-throughput\nservices. The open RAN (O-RAN) is one of the candidates to achieve this goal,\nin addition to increasing vendor diversity and promoting openness. In the O-RAN\narchitecture, network functions are executed in central units (CU), distributed\nunits (DU), and radio units (RU). These entities are virtualized on\ngeneral-purpose CPUs and form a processing pool. These processing pools can be\nlocated in different geographical places and have limited capacity, affecting\nthe energy consumption and the performance of networks. Additionally, since\nuser demand is not deterministic, special attention should be paid to\nallocating resource blocks to users by ensuring their expected quality of\nservice for latency-sensitive traffic flows. In this paper, we propose a joint\noptimization solution to enhance energy efficiency and provide delay guarantees\nto the users in the O-RAN architecture. We formulate this novel problem and\nlinearize it to provide a solution with a mixed-integer linear problem (MILP)\nsolver. We compare this with a baseline that addresses this optimization\nproblem using a disjoint approach. The results show that our approach\noutperforms the baseline method in terms of energy efficiency.",

This\ntechnique leverages deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) to formulate a policy\nwhich is suitable for real-time implementation. There is no separation of\nmotion primitive generation and trajectory planning: each individual\nshort-horizon motion is formed during the Deep RL training to achieve the\nfull-horizon objective. Effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated\nnumerically on a well-studied trajectory generation problem and a planning\nproblem on a known obstacle-rich map.

    "abstract": "Understanding the trustworthiness of a prediction yielded by a classifier is\ncritical for the safe and effective use of AI models. Prior efforts have been\nproven to be reliable on small-scale datasets. In this work, we study the\nproblem of predicting trustworthiness on real-world large-scale datasets, where\nthe task is more challenging due to high-dimensional features, diverse visual\nconcepts, and large-scale samples. In such a setting, we observe that the\ntrustworthiness predictors trained with prior-art loss functions, i.e., the\ncross entropy loss, focal loss, and true class probability confidence loss, are\nprone to view both correct predictions and incorrect predictions to be\ntrustworthy. The reasons are two-fold. Firstly, correct predictions are\ngenerally dominant over incorrect predictions. Secondly, due to the data\ncomplexity, it is challenging to differentiate the incorrect predictions from\nthe correct ones on real-world large-scale datasets. To improve the\ngeneralizability of trustworthiness predictors, we propose a novel steep slope\nloss to separate the features w.r.t. correct predictions from the ones w.r.t.\nincorrect predictions by two slide-like curves that oppose each other. The\nproposed loss is evaluated with two representative deep learning models, i.e.,\nVision Transformer and ResNet, as trustworthiness predictors. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments and analyses on ImageNet, which show that the\nproposed loss effectively improves the generalizability of trustworthiness\npredictors.

However,\nprogress in this area has been challenging both to make and to measure, due to\nseveral issues that arise in training and evaluating models from labeled data.\nThis includes challenges as fundamental as the lack of a single definitive\nground truth output for each input sample and the lack of an ideal metric for\nmeasuring partial correctness for this task. To address these we propose a new\ndataset, PubMed Tables One Million (PubTables-1M), and a new class of metric,\ngrid table similarity (GriTS). PubTables-1M is nearly twice as large as the\nprevious largest comparable dataset, can be used for models across multiple\narchitectures and modalities, and addresses issues such as ambiguity and lack\nof consistency in the annotations. We apply DETR to table extraction for the\nfirst time and show that object detection models trained on PubTables-1M\nproduce excellent results out-of-the-box for all three tasks of detection,\nstructure recognition, and functional analysis. We describe the dataset in\ndetail to enable others to build on our work and combine this data with other\ndatasets for these and related tasks. It is our hope that PubTables-1M and the\nproposed metrics can further progress in this area by creating a benchmark\nsuitable for training and evaluating a wide variety of models for table\nextraction.

    "abstract": "Developing exoskeletons that can reduce the metabolic cost of assisted\nsubjects is challenging since a systematic design approach is required to\ncapture the effects of device dynamics and the assistance torques on human\nperformance. Design studies that rely on musculoskeletal models hold high\npromise in providing effective design guidelines, as the effect of various\ndevices and different assistance torque profiles on metabolic cost can be\nstudied systematically. In this paper, we present a simulation-based\nmulti-criteria design approach to systematically study the effect of different\ndevice kinematics and corresponding optimal assistive torque profiles under\nactuator saturation on the metabolic cost, muscle activation, and joint\nreaction forces of subjects walking under different loading conditions. For the\nmulti-criteria comparison of exoskeletons, we introduce a Pareto optimization\napproach to simultaneously optimize the exoskeleton power consumption and the\nhuman metabolic rate reduction during walking, under different loading\nconditions. We further superpose the effects of device inertia and electrical\nregeneration on the metabolic rate and power consumption, respectively. Our\nresults explain the effects of heavy loads on the optimal assistance profiles\nof the exoskeletons and provide guidelines on choosing optimal device\nconfigurations under actuator torque limitations, device inertia, and\nregeneration effects. The multi-criteria comparison of devices indicates that\ndespite the similar assistance levels of both devices, mono-articular\nexoskeletons show better performance on reducing the peak reaction forces,\nwhile the power consumption of bi-articular devices is less sensitive to the\nloading. Furthermore, for the bi-articular exoskeletons, the device inertia has\nlower detrimental effects on the metabolic cost of subjects and does not affect\nthe Pareto-optimality of solutions.",

A common motion\nplanning approach is to generate trajectories within semantic safe corridors.\nThe trajectories are generated by optimizing parametric curves (\\textit{e.g.}\nBezier curves) according to an objective function. To guarantee safety, the\ncurves are required to satisfy the convex hull property, and be contained\nwithin the safety corridors. The convex hull property however does not\nnecessary hold for time-dependent corridors, and depends on the shape of\ncorridors. The existing approaches only support simple shape corridors, which\nis restrictive in real-world, complex scenarios. In this paper, we provide a\nsufficient condition for general convex, spatio-temporal corridors with\ntheoretical proof of guaranteed convex hull property. The theorem allows for\nusing more complicated shapes to generate spatio-temporal corridors and\nminimizing the uncovered search space to $O(\\frac{1}{n^2})$ compared to $O(1)$\nof trapezoidal corridors, which can improve the optimality of the solution.\nSimulation results show that using general convex corridors yields less harsh\nbrakes, hence improving the overall smoothness of the resulting trajectories.",

To this end, we propose a directed network model with\npreferential attachment and homophily (DPAH) and demonstrate the influence of\nnetwork structure on the rank distributions of these algorithms. Our main\nfindings suggest that (i) inequality is positively correlated with inequity,\n(ii) inequality is driven by the interplay between preferential attachment,\nhomophily, node activity and edge density, and (iii) inequity is mainly driven\nby homophily. In particular, these two algorithms amplify, replicate and reduce\ninequity in top ranks when majorities are homophilic, neutral and heterophilic,\nrespectively. Moreover, when inequity is amplified, minorities may improve\ntheir visibility in the rank by connecting strategically in the network. For\ninstance, by increasing their homophily when majorities are also homophilic.\nThese findings shed light on social and algorithmic mechanisms that hinder\nequality and equity in network-based ranking and recommendation algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) allow to control the propagation\nenvironment in wireless networks by properly tuning multiple reflecting\nelements. Traditionally, RISs have been realized through single connected\nreconfigurable impedance networks, in which each RIS element is independently\ncontrolled by an impedance connected to ground. In a recent work, this\narchitecture has been extended by realizing more efficient RISs with group and\nfully connected reconfigurable impedance networks. However, impedance networks\ntunable with arbitrary precision are hard to realize in practice. In this\npaper, we propose a practical RIS design strategy based on reconfigurable\nimpedance networks with discrete values. Besides, we address the problem of how\nto group the RIS elements in group connected architectures. We optimize single,\ngroup, and fully connected architectures considering finite-resolution\nelements, and we compare them in terms of received signal power. Through Monte\nCarlo simulations, supported by theoretical justifications, we show that only a\nfew resolution bits per reconfigurable impedance are sufficient to achieve the\nperformance upper bound. In particular, while four resolution bits are needed\nto reach the upper bound in single connected architectures, only a single\nresolution bit is sufficient in fully connected ones, simplifying significantly\nthe future development of these promising RIS architectures.",

    "abstract": "Statistic modeling and data-driven learning are the two vital fields that\nattract many attentions. Statistic models intend to capture and interpret the\nrelationships among variables, while data-based learning attempt to extract\ninformation directly from the data without pre-processing through complex\nmodels. Given the extensive studies in both fields, a subtle issue is how to\nproperly integrate data based methods with existing knowledge or models. In\nthis paper, based on the time series data, we propose two different directions\nto integrate the two, a decomposition-based method and a method exploiting the\nstatistic extraction of data features. The first one decomposes the data into\nlinear stable, nonlinear stable and unstable parts, where suitable statistical\nmodels are used for the linear stable and nonlinear stable parts while the\nappropriate machine learning tools are used for the unstable parts. The second\none applies statistic models to extract statistics features of data and feed\nthem as additional inputs into the machine learning platform for training. The\nmost critical and challenging thing is how to determine and extract the\nvaluable information from mathematical or statistical models to boost the\nperformance of machine learning algorithms. We evaluate the proposal using time\nseries data with varying degrees of stability. Performance results show that\nboth methods can outperform existing schemes that use models and learning\nseparately, and the improvements can be over 60%. Both our proposed methods are\npromising in bridging the gap between model-based and data-driven schemes and\nintegrating the two to provide an overall higher learning performance.",

Algorithms as such usually rely on a forward model and use an\niterative gradient method that requires sampling millions of light paths per\niteration. This paper presents an efficient framework that speeds up existing\ninverse rendering algorithms. This is achieved by tailoring the iterative\nprocess of inverse rendering specifically to a GPU architecture. For this\ncause, we introduce two interleaved steps - Path Sorting and Path Recycling.\nPath Sorting allows the GPU to deal with light paths of the same size. Path\nRecycling allows the algorithm to use light paths from previous iterations to\nbetter utilize the information they encode. Together, these steps significantly\nspeed up gradient optimization. In this paper, we give the theoretical\nbackground for Path Recycling. We demonstrate its efficiency for volumetric\nscattering tomography and reflectometry (surface reflections).",

For any explainability\ntechnique to be trustworthy and meaningful, it has to provide an explanation\nthat is accurate and stable. Although the stability of local feature importance\nmethods (explaining individual predictions) has been studied before, there is\nyet a knowledge gap about the stability of global features importance methods\n(explanations for the whole model). Additionally, there is no study that\nevaluates and compares the accuracy of global feature importance methods with\nrespect to feature ordering. In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy and\nstability of global feature importance methods through comprehensive\nexperiments done on simulations as well as four real-world datasets. We focus\non tree-based ensemble methods as they are used widely in industry and measure\nthe accuracy and stability of explanations under two scenarios: 1) when inputs\nare perturbed 2) when models are perturbed. Our findings provide a comparison\nof these methods under a variety of settings and shed light on the limitations\nof global feature importance methods by indicating their lack of accuracy with\nand without noisy inputs, as well as their lack of stability with respect to:\n1) increase in input dimension or noise in the data; 2) perturbations in models\ninitialized by different random seeds or hyperparameter settings.",

It is in principle possible to convert loopy PGMs to an\nequivalent tree structure, but for most interesting problems this is\nimpractical due to exponential blow-up. To address this, we developed the\npurge-and-merge algorithm.

The merging process is designed to avoid exponential blow-up\nby making use of sparse structures from which redundancy is purged as the\nalgorithm progresses.

    "abstract": "In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), it is challenging for a\ncollection of agents to learn complex temporally extended tasks. The\ndifficulties lie in computational complexity and how to learn the high-level\nideas behind reward functions. We study the graph-based Markov Decision Process\n(MDP) where the dynamics of neighboring agents are coupled. We use a reward\nmachine (RM) to encode each agent's task and expose reward function internal\nstructures. RM has the capacity to describe high-level knowledge and encode\nnon-Markovian reward functions. We propose a decentralized learning algorithm\nto tackle computational complexity, called decentralized graph-based\nreinforcement learning using reward machines (DGRM), that equips each agent\nwith a localized policy, allowing agents to make decisions independently, based\non the information available to the agents. DGRM uses the actor-critic\nstructure, and we introduce the tabular Q-function for discrete state problems.\nWe show that the dependency of Q-function on other agents decreases\nexponentially as the distance between them increases. Furthermore, the\ncomplexity of DGRM is related to the local information size of the largest\n$\\kappa$-hop neighborhood, and DGRM can find an\n$O(\\rho^{\\kappa+1})$-approximation of a stationary point of the objective\nfunction. To further improve efficiency, we also propose the deep DGRM\nalgorithm, using deep neural networks to approximate the Q-function and policy\nfunction to solve large-scale or continuous state problems. The effectiveness\nof the proposed DGRM algorithm is evaluated by two case studies, UAV package\ndelivery and COVID-19 pandemic mitigation. Experimental results show that local\ninformation is sufficient for DGRM and agents can accomplish complex tasks with\nthe help of RM. DGRM improves the global accumulated reward by 119% compared to\nthe baseline in the case of COVID-19 pandemic mitigation.",

Political systems around the\nworld experience gender inequality across all levels of elected government as\nfewer women run for office than men. This is due in part to online abuse,\nparticularly on social media platforms like Twitter, where women seeking or in\npower tend to be targeted with more toxic maltreatment than their male\ncounterparts. In this paper, we present reflections on ParityBOT - the first\nnatural language processing-based intervention designed to affect online\ndiscourse for women in politics for the better, at scale. Deployed across\nelections in Canada, the United States and New Zealand, ParityBOT was used to\nanalyse and classify more than 12 million tweets directed at women candidates\nand counter toxic tweets with supportive ones. From these elections we present\nthree case studies highlighting the current limitations of, and future research\nand application opportunities for, using a natural language processing-based\nsystem to detect online toxicity, specifically with regards to contextually\nimportant microaggressions. We examine the rate of false negatives, where\nParityBOT failed to pick up on insults directed at specific high profile women,\nwhich would be obvious to human users.

In an A/B\ntest, traffic is randomly allocated between a treatment group, which uses the\nnew algorithm, and a control group, which uses the existing algorithm. However,\nbecause networks are congested, both treatment and control traffic compete\nagainst each other for resources in a way that biases the outcome of these\ntests. This bias can have a surprisingly large effect; for example, in lab A/B\ntests with two widely used congestion control algorithms, the treatment\nappeared to deliver 150% higher throughput when used by a few flows, and 75%\nlower throughput when used by most flows-despite the fact that the two\nalgorithms have identical throughput when used by all traffic.\nBeyond the lab, we show that A/B tests can also be biased at scale.

    "title": "HUMBI: A Large Multiview Dataset of Human Body Expressions and Benchmark  Challenge",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a new large multiview dataset called HUMBI for human body\nexpressions with natural clothing. The goal of HUMBI is to facilitate modeling\nview-specific appearance and geometry of five primary body signals including\ngaze, face, hand, body, and garment from assorted people. 107 synchronized HD\ncameras are used to capture 772 distinctive subjects across gender, ethnicity,\nage, and style. With the multiview image streams, we reconstruct high fidelity\nbody expressions using 3D mesh models, which allows representing view-specific\nappearance. We demonstrate that HUMBI is highly effective in learning and\nreconstructing a complete human model and is complementary to the existing\ndatasets of human body expressions with limited views and subjects such as\nMPII-Gaze, Multi-PIE, Human3.6M, and Panoptic Studio datasets. Based on HUMBI,\nwe formulate a new benchmark challenge of a pose-guided appearance rendering\ntask that aims to substantially extend photorealism in modeling diverse human\nexpressions in 3D, which is the key enabling factor of authentic social\ntele-presence. HUMBI is publicly available at this http URL",

    "title": "Emergence of Theory of Mind Collaboration in Multiagent Systems",
    "abstract": "Currently, in the study of multiagent systems, the intentions of agents are\nusually ignored. Nonetheless, as pointed out by Theory of Mind (ToM), people\nregularly reason about other's mental states, including beliefs, goals, and\nintentions, to obtain performance advantage in competition, cooperation or\ncoalition. However, due to its intrinsic recursion and intractable modeling of\ndistribution over belief, integrating ToM in multiagent planning and decision\nmaking is still a challenge. In this paper, we incorporate ToM in multiagent\npartially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose an adaptive\ntraining algorithm to develop effective collaboration between agents with ToM.\nWe evaluate our algorithms with two games, where our algorithm surpasses all\nprevious decentralized execution algorithms without modeling ToM.",

Reliability redundancy allocation\nproblem (RRAP) is a well-known reliability design tool, which needs to be\ndeveloped when the system is extended from the series-parallel structure to a\nmore general network structure. Therefore, this study proposes a novel RRAP\ncalled General RRAP (GRRAP) to be applied to network systems. The Binary\nAddition Tree Algorithm (BAT) is used to solve the network reliability. Since\nGRRAP is an NP-hard problem, a new algorithm called Binary-addition simplified\nswarm optimization (BSSO) is also proposed in this study. BSSO combines the\naccuracy of the BAT with the efficiency of SSO, which can effectively reduce\nthe solution space and speed up the time to find high-quality solutions. The\nexperimental results show that BSSO outperforms three well-known algorithms,\nGenetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Swarm\nOptimization (SSO), on six network benchmarks.",

    "title": "A Data-Driven Memory-Dependent Modeling Framework for Anomalous  Rheology: Application to Urinary Bladder Tissue",
    "abstract": "We introduce a data-driven fractional modeling framework aimed at complex\nmaterials, and particularly bio-tissues. From multi-step relaxation experiments\nof distinct anatomical locations of porcine urinary bladder, we identify an\nanomalous relaxation character, with two power-law-like behaviors for\nshort/long long times, and nonlinearity for strains greater than 25%. The first\ncomponent of our framework is an existence study, to determine admissible\nfractional viscoelastic models that qualitatively describe the linear\nrelaxation behavior. After the linear viscoelastic model is selected, the\nsecond stage adds large-strain effects to the framework through a fractional\nquasi-linear viscoelastic approach, given by a multiplicative kernel\ndecomposition of the selected relaxation function and a nonlinear elastic\nresponse for the bio-tissue of interest. From single-relaxation data of the\nurinary bladder, a fractional Maxwell model captures both short/long-term\nbehaviors with two fractional orders, being the most suitable model for small\nstrains at the first stage. For the second stage, multi-step relaxation data\nunder large strains were employed to calibrate a four-parameter fractional\nquasi-linear viscoelastic model, that combines a Scott-Blair relaxation\nfunction and an exponential instantaneous stress response, to describe the\nelastin/collagen phases of bladder rheology. Our obtained results demonstrate\nthat the employed fractional quasi-linear model, with a single fractional order\nin the range $\\alpha = 0.25 - 0.30$, is suitable for the porcine urinary\nbladder, producing errors below 2% without need for recalibration over\nsubsequent applied strains. We conclude that fractional models are attractive\ntools to capture the bladder tissue behavior under small-to-large strains and\nmultiple time scales, therefore being potential alternatives to describe\nmultiple stages of bladder functionality.",

Our approach produces personalized responses by adding fixed,\nnon-trainable user identifiers to the input data.

    "abstract": "The Kalman filter computes the optimal variable-gain using prior knowledge of\nthe initial state and random (process and measurement) noise distributions,\nwhich are assumed to be Gaussian with known variance. However, when these\ndistributions are unknown, the Kalman filter is not necessarily optimal and\nother simpler state-estimators, such as fixed-gain ({\\alpha}, {\\alpha}-\\b{eta}\nor {\\alpha}-\\b{eta}-{\\gamma} etc.) filters may be sufficient. When such filters\nare used as low-complexity state-estimators in embedded tracking systems, the\nfixed gain parameters are usually set equal to the steady-state gains of the\ncorresponding Kalman filter. An alternative procedure, that does not rely prior\ndistributions, based on Luenberger observers, is presented here. It is\nsuggested that the arbitrary placement of closed-loop state-observer poles is a\nsimple and intuitive way of tuning the transient and steady-state response of a\nfixed-gain tracking filter when prior distributions are unknown. All poles are\nplaced inside the unit circle on the positive real axis of the complex z-plane\nat p for a well damped response and a configurable bandwidth. Transient bias\nerrors, e.g. due to target manoeuvres or process modelling errors, decrease as\np=0 is approached for a wider bandwidth. Steady-state random errors, e.g. due\nto sensor noise, decrease as p=1 is approached for a narrower bandwidth. Thus\nthe p parameter (with 0<p<1) may be interpreted as a dimensionless smoothing\nfactor. This tutorial-style report examines state-observer design by pole\nplacement, which is a standard procedure for feedback controls but unusual for\ntracking filters, due to the success and popularity of the Kalman filter. As\nBayesian trackers are designed via statistical modelling, not by pole-zero\nplacement in the complex plane, the underlying principles of linear\ntime-invariant signals and systems are also reviewed.",

Through our experimental\nresults, the proposed approach SpanSeg achieves higher performance than the\nsequence tagging approach with the state-of-the-art F-score of 98.31% on the\nVietnamese treebank benchmark, when they both apply the contextual pre-trained\nlanguage model XLM-RoBERTa and the predicted word boundary information.\nBesides, we do fine-tuning experiments for the span labeling approach on BERT\nand ZEN pre-trained language model for Chinese with fewer parameters, faster\ninference time, and competitive or higher F-scores than the previous\nstate-of-the-art approach, word segmentation with word-hood memory networks, on\nfive Chinese benchmarks.",

This result implies that Thompson sampling can maintain its\nperformance even if it receives delayed feedback in $\\omega(\\log T)$ batches.\nWe further propose an adaptive batching scheme that reduces the number of\nbatches to $\\Theta(\\log T)$ while maintaining the same performance. Although\nthe batched multi-armed bandit setting has been considered in several recent\nworks, previous results rely on tailored algorithms for the batched setting,\nwhich optimize the batch structure and prioritize exploration in the beginning\nof the experiment to eliminate suboptimal actions.

For this task, the adoption of pre-trained language models (such\nas BERT) has led to remarkable progress in a number of benchmarks. There exist\ntwo common approaches, including cross-encoders which perform full attention\nover the inputs, and bi-encoders that encode the context and response\nseparately. The former gives considerable improvements in accuracy but is often\ninapplicable in practice for large-scale retrieval given the cost of the full\nattention required for each sample at test time. The latter is efficient for\nbillions of indexes but suffers from sub-optimal performance. In this work, we\npropose to combine the best of both worlds to build a retrieval system.\nSpecifically, we employ a fast bi-encoder to replace the traditional\nfeature-based pre-retrieval model (such as BM25) and set the response\nre-ranking model as a more complicated architecture (such as cross-encoder). To\nfurther improve the effectiveness of our framework, we train the pre-retrieval\nmodel and the re-ranking model at the same time via mutual learning, which\nenables two models to learn from each other throughout the training process.

What may not be obvious at first glance is that, in addition to the work\nthey do for pay, crowd workers also have to shoulder a variety of unpaid\ninvisible labor in these markets, which ultimately reduces workers' hourly\nwages. Invisible labor includes finding good tasks, messaging requesters, or\nmanaging payments. However, we currently know little about how much time crowd\nworkers actually spend on invisible labor or how much it costs them\neconomically. To ensure a fair and equitable future for crowd work, we need to\nbe certain that workers are being paid fairly for all of the work they do. In\nthis paper, we conduct a field study to quantify the invisible labor in crowd\nwork. We build a plugin to record the amount of time that 100 workers on Amazon\nMechanical Turk dedicate to invisible labor while completing 40,903 tasks. If\nwe ignore the time workers spent on invisible labor, workers' median hourly\nwage was $3.76. But, we estimated that crowd workers in our study spent 33% of\ntheir time daily on invisible labor, dropping their median hourly wage to\n$2.83. We found that the invisible labor differentially impacts workers\ndepending on their skill level and workers' demographics. The invisible labor\ncategory that took the most time and that was also the most common revolved\naround workers having to manage their payments. The second most time-consuming\ninvisible labor category involved hyper-vigilance, where workers vigilantly\nwatched over requesters' profiles for newly posted work or vigilantly searched\nfor labor. We hope that through our paper, the invisible labor in crowdsourcing\nbecomes more visible, and our results help to reveal the larger implications of\nthe continuing invisibility of labor in crowdsourcing.",

The algorithm interleaves\nbetween batch sampling, building a graph of nominal trajectories in the state\nspace, and searching over the graph to find belief space motion plans. By\nsearching over the graph, BBT finds sophisticated plans that will visit (and\nrevisit) information-rich regions to reduce uncertainty. One of the key\nbenefits of this algorithm is the modified interplay between exploration and\nexploitation. Instead of an exhaustive search (exploitation) after one\nexploration step, the proposed algorithm uses batch samples to explore the\nstate space and also does not require exhaustive search before the next\niteration of batch sampling, which adds flexibility. The algorithm finds motion\nplans that converge to the optimal one as more samples are added to the graph.\nWe test BBT in different planning environments.

    "abstract": "In offline reinforcement learning (offline RL), one of the main challenges is\nto deal with the distributional shift between the learning policy and the given\ndataset. To address this problem, recent offline RL methods attempt to\nintroduce conservatism bias to encourage learning on high-confidence areas.\nModel-free approaches directly encode such bias into policy or value function\nlearning using conservative regularizations or special network structures, but\ntheir constrained policy search limits the generalization beyond the offline\ndataset. Model-based approaches learn forward dynamics models with conservatism\nquantifications and then generate imaginary trajectories to extend the offline\ndatasets. However, due to limited samples in offline dataset, conservatism\nquantifications often suffer from overgeneralization in out-of-support regions.\nThe unreliable conservative measures will mislead forward model-based\nimaginations to undesired areas, leading to overaggressive behaviors. To\nencourage more conservatism, we propose a novel model-based offline RL\nframework, called Reverse Offline Model-based Imagination (ROMI). We learn a\nreverse dynamics model in conjunction with a novel reverse policy, which can\ngenerate rollouts leading to the target goal states within the offline dataset.\nThese reverse imaginations provide informed data augmentation for the\nmodel-free policy learning and enable conservative generalization beyond the\noffline dataset. ROMI can effectively combine with off-the-shelf model-free\nalgorithms to enable model-based generalization with proper conservatism.\nEmpirical results show that our method can generate more conservative behaviors\nand achieve state-of-the-art performance on offline RL benchmark tasks.",

Guided by this, the main theme of wireless system design up until 5G\nwas the data rate maximization. In his theory, the semantic aspect and meaning\nof messages were treated as largely irrelevant to communication. The classic\ntheory started to reveal its limitations in the modern era of machine\nintelligence, consisting of the synergy between IoT and AI. By broadening the\nscope of the classic framework, in this article we present a view of semantic\ncommunication (SemCom) and conveying meaning through the communication systems.\nWe address three communication modalities, human-to-human (H2H),\nhuman-to-machine (H2M), and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. The latter\ntwo, the main theme of the article, represent the paradigm shift in\ncommunication and computing. H2M SemCom refers to semantic techniques for\nconveying meanings understandable by both humans and machines so that they can\ninteract. M2M SemCom refers to effectiveness techniques for efficiently\nconnecting machines such that they can effectively execute a specific\ncomputation task in a wireless network. The first part of the article\nintroduces SemCom principles including encoding, system architecture, and\nlayer-coupling and end-to-end design approaches. The second part focuses on\nspecific techniques for application areas of H2M (human and AI symbiosis,\nrecommendation, etc.) and M2M SemCom (distributed learning, split inference,\netc.) Finally, we discuss the knowledge graphs approach for designing SemCom\nsystems. We believe that this comprehensive introduction will provide a useful\nguide into the emerging area of SemCom that is expected to play an important\nrole in 6G featuring connected intelligence and integrated sensing, computing,\ncommunication, and control.",

    "abstract": "In Machine Learning, optimization mostly has been done by using a gradient\ndescent method to find the minimum value of the loss. However, especially in\ndeep learning, finding a global minimum from a nonconvex loss function across a\nhigh dimensional space is an extraordinarily difficult task. Recently, a\ngeneralization learning algorithm, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), has made\na great success in image classification task. Despite the great performance in\ncreating convex space, proper direction leading by SAM is still remained\nunclear. We, thereby, propose a creating a Unit Vector space in SAM, which not\nonly consisted of the mathematical instinct in linear algebra but also kept the\nadvantages of adaptive gradient algorithm. Moreover, applying SAM in unit\ngradient brings models competitive performances in image classification\ndatasets, such as CIFAR - {10, 100}. The experiment showed that it performed\neven better and more robust than SAM.",

Besides, under mild assumptions, the equivalence of the 2\nlattice PWA approximations guarantees the approximations are error-free in the\ndomain of interest. The algorithms for deriving statistical error-free\napproximation to the explicit linear MPC is proposed and the complexity of the\nwhole procedure is analyzed, which is polynomial with respect to the number of\nsamples. The performance of the proposed approximation strategy is tested\nthrough 2 simulation examples, and the result shows that with a moderate number\nof sample points, we can construct lattice PWA approximations that are\nequivalent to optimal control law of the explicit linear MPC.",

We show that this policy\nsimultaneously achieves a problem dependent regret of order $O(\\log(T))$ and a\nminimax regret of order $O(\\sqrt{T\\log(T)})$ while the number of batches can be\nbounded by $O(\\log(T))$ independent of the problem instance over a time horizon\n$T$. We also show that in expectation the number of batches used by our policy\ncan be bounded by an instance dependent bound of order $O(\\log\\log(T))$. These\nresults indicate that Thompson sampling maintains the same performance in this\nbatched setting as in the case when instantaneous feedback is available after\neach action, while requiring minimal feedback. These results also indicate that\nThompson sampling performs competitively with recently proposed algorithms\ntailored for the batched setting. These algorithms optimize the batch structure\nfor a given time horizon $T$ and prioritize exploration in the beginning of the\nexperiment to eliminate suboptimal actions. We show that Thompson sampling\ncombined with an adaptive batching strategy can achieve a similar performance\nwithout knowing the time horizon $T$ of the problem and without having to\ncarefully optimize the batch structure to achieve a target regret bound (i.e.\nproblem dependent vs minimax regret) for a given $T$.",

Particularly, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and HyperDimensional\nComputing (HDC) have shown promising results in enabling efficient and robust\ncognitive learning. Despite the success, these two brain-inspired models have\ndifferent strengths. While SNN mimics the physical properties of the human\nbrain, HDC models the brain on a more abstract and functional level.

SpikeHD generates a scalable and strong\ncognitive learning system that better mimics brain functionality. SpikeHD\nexploits spiking neural networks to extract low-level features by preserving\nthe spatial and temporal correlation of raw event-based spike data. Then, it\nutilizes HDC to operate over SNN output by mapping the signal into\nhigh-dimensional space, learning the abstract information, and classifying the\ndata. Our extensive evaluation on a set of benchmark classification problems\nshows that SpikeHD provides the following benefit compared to SNN architecture:\n(1) significantly enhance learning capability by exploiting two-stage\ninformation processing, (2) enables substantial robustness to noise and\nfailure, and (3) reduces the network size and required parameters to learn\ncomplex information.",

    "abstract": "An effective unsupervised hashing algorithm leads to compact binary codes\npreserving the neighborhood structure of data as much as possible. One of the\nmost established schemes for unsupervised hashing is to reduce the\ndimensionality of data and then find a rigid (neighbourhood-preserving)\ntransformation that reduces the quantization error. Although employing rigid\ntransformations is effective, we may not reduce quantization loss to the\nultimate limits. As well, reducing dimensionality and quantization loss in two\nseparate steps seems to be sub-optimal. Motivated by these shortcomings, we\npropose to employ both rigid and non-rigid transformations to reduce\nquantization error and dimensionality simultaneously. We relax the\northogonality constraint on the projection in a PCA-formulation and regularize\nthis by a quantization term. We show that both the non-rigid projection matrix\nand rotation matrix contribute towards minimizing quantization loss but in\ndifferent ways. A scalable nested coordinate descent approach is proposed to\noptimize this mixed-integer optimization problem.

    "title": "Improving Object Permanence using Agent Actions and Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Object permanence in psychology means knowing that objects still exist even\nif they are no longer visible. It is a crucial concept for robots to operate\nautonomously in uncontrolled environments. Existing approaches learn object\npermanence from low-level perception, but perform poorly on more complex\nscenarios, like when objects are contained and carried by others. Knowledge\nabout manipulation actions performed on an object prior to its disappearance\nallows us to reason about its location, e.g., that the object has been placed\nin a carrier. In this paper we argue that object permanence can be improved\nwhen the robot uses knowledge about executed actions and describe an approach\nto infer hidden object states from agent actions. We show that considering\nagent actions not only improves rule-based reasoning models but also purely\nneural approaches, showing its general applicability. Then, we conduct\nquantitative experiments on a snitch localization task using a dataset of 1,371\nsynthesized videos, where we compare the performance of different object\npermanence models with and without action annotations. We demonstrate that\nmodels with action annotations can significantly increase performance of both\nneural and rule-based approaches. Finally, we evaluate the usability of our\napproach in real-world applications by conducting qualitative experiments with\ntwo Universal Robots (UR5 and UR16e) in both lab and industrial settings. The\nrobots complete benchmark tasks for a gearbox assembly and demonstrate the\nobject permanence capabilities with real sensor data in an industrial\nenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been a challenging problem yet it needs\nto be solved. It will mainly be used for eldercare and healthcare as an\nassistive technology when ensemble with other technologies like Internet of\nThings(IoT). HAR can be achieved with the help of sensors, smartphones or\nimages. Deep neural network techniques like artificial neural networks,\nconvolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks have been used in\nHAR, both in centralized and federated setting. However, these techniques have\ncertain limitations. RNNs have limitation of parallelization, CNNS have the\nlimitation of sequence length and they are computationally expensive. In this\npaper, to address the state of art challenges, we present a inertial\nsensors-based novel one patch transformer which gives the best of both RNNs and\nCNNs for Human activity recognition. We also design a testbed to collect\nreal-time human activity data. The data collected is further used to train and\ntest the proposed transformer. With the help of experiments, we show that the\nproposed transformer outperforms the state of art CNN and RNN based\nclassifiers, both in federated and centralized setting. Moreover, the proposed\ntransformer is computationally inexpensive as it uses very few parameter\ncompared to the existing state of art CNN and RNN based classifier. Thus its\nmore suitable for federated learning as it provides less communication and\ncomputational cost.",

    "title": "Synergizing between Self-Training and Adversarial Learning for Domain  Adaptive Object Detection",
    "abstract": "We study adapting trained object detectors to unseen domains manifesting\nsignificant variations of object appearance, viewpoints and backgrounds. Most\ncurrent methods align domains by either using image or instance-level feature\nalignment in an adversarial fashion. This often suffers due to the presence of\nunwanted background and as such lacks class-specific alignment. A common remedy\nto promote class-level alignment is to use high confidence predictions on the\nunlabelled domain as pseudo labels. These high confidence predictions are often\nfallacious since the model is poorly calibrated under domain shift. In this\npaper, we propose to leverage model predictive uncertainty to strike the right\nbalance between adversarial feature alignment and class-level alignment.\nSpecifically, we measure predictive uncertainty on class assignments and the\nbounding box predictions. Model predictions with low uncertainty are used to\ngenerate pseudo-labels for self-supervision, whereas the ones with higher\nuncertainty are used to generate tiles for an adversarial feature alignment\nstage. This synergy between tiling around the uncertain object regions and\ngenerating pseudo-labels from highly certain object regions allows us to\ncapture both the image and instance level context during the model adaptation\nstage. We perform extensive experiments covering various domain shift\nscenarios. Our approach improves upon existing state-of-the-art methods with\nvisible margins.",

    "title": "A Step Towards On-Path Security Function Outsourcing",
    "abstract": "Security function outsourcing has witnessed both research and deployment in\nthe recent years. While most existing services take a straight-forward approach\nof cloud hosting, on-path transit networks (such as ISPs) are increasingly more\ninterested in offering outsourced security services to end users. Recent\nproposals (such as SafeBricks and mbTLS) have made it possible to outsource\nsensitive security applications to untrusted, arbitrary networks, rendering\non-path security function outsourcing more promising than ever. However, to\nprovide on-path security function outsourcing, there is one crucial component\nthat is still missing -- a practical end-to-end network protocol. Thus, the\ndiscovery and orchestration of multiple capable and willing transit networks\nfor user-requested security functions have only been assumed in many studies\nwithout any practical solutions. In this work, we propose Opsec, an end-to-end\nsecurity-outsourcing protocol that fills this gap and brings us closer to the\nvision of on-path security function outsourcing. Opsec automatically discovers\none or more transit ISPs between a client and a server, and requests\nuser-specified security functions efficiently. When designing Opsec, we\nprioritize the practicality and applicability of this new end-to-end protocol\nin the current Internet. Our proof-of-concept implementation of Opsec for web\nsessions shows that an end user can easily start a new web session with a few\nclicks of a browser plug-in, to specify a series of security functions of her\nchoice. We show that it is possible to implement such a new end-to-end service\nmodel in the current Internet for the majority of the web services without any\nmajor changes to the standard protocols (e.g., TCP, TLS, HTTP) and the existing\nnetwork infrastructure (e.g., ISP's routing primitives).",

The classifier is open-set meaning\nit assumes unknown waveforms may appear. Isolation forest (IF) models acting as\nbinary classifiers are used for each known signal class to perform detection of\npossible unknown signals. This is accomplished using the 32-length feature\nvector from a dense layer as input to the IF models. The classifier and IF\nmodels work together to monitor the spectrum and identify waveforms along with\ndetecting unknown waveforms. Results showed the classifier had 100%\nclassification rate above 0 dB with an accuracy of 83.2% and 94.7% at -10 dB\nand -5 dB, respectively, with signal impairments present. Results for the IF\nmodels showed an overall accuracy of 98% when detecting known and unknown\nsignals with signal impairments present. IF models were able to reject all\nunknown signals while signals similar to known signals were able to pass\nthrough 2% of the time due to the contamination rate used during training.\nOverall, the entire system can classify correctly in an open-set mode with 98%\naccuracy at SNR greater than 0 dB.",

These are voting rules applied\non profiles with approval ballots, where each voter approves some of the\ncandidates. ABCS rules adapt positional scoring rules in single-winner voting\nby assuming that each committee of $k$ candidates collects from each voter a\nscore, that depends on the size of the voter's ballot and on the size of its\nintersection with the committee. Then, committees of maximum score are the\nwinning ones. Our goal is to learn a target rule (i.e., to learn the\ncorresponding scoring function) using information about the winning committees\nof a small number of sampled profiles. Despite the existence of exponentially\nmany outcomes compared to single-winner elections, we show that the sample\ncomplexity is still low: a polynomial number of samples carries enough\ninformation for learning the target committee with high confidence and\naccuracy. Unfortunately, even simple tasks that need to be solved for learning\nfrom these samples are intractable. We prove that deciding whether there exists\nsome ABCS rule that makes a given committee winning in a given profile is a\ncomputationally hard problem.

However, official insight is\nhampered by the Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) procedure conducted in the\nlaboratory annually. It not only has a large gap to real-world situations\n(e.g., meteorological conditions) but also is incapable of regular supervision.\nHere we build a unique dataset including 103831 light-duty gasoline vehicles,\nin which on-road remote sensing (ORRS) measurements are linked to the I/M\nrecords based on the vehicle identification numbers and license plates. On this\nbasis, we develop an ensemble model framework that integrates three machining\nlearning algorithms, including neural network (NN), extreme gradient boosting\n(XGBoost), and random forest (RF). We demonstrate that this ensemble model\ncould rapidly assess the vehicle-specific emissions (i.e., CO, HC, and NO). In\nparticular, the model performs quite well for the passing vehicles under normal\nconditions (i.e., lower VSP (< 18 kw/t), temperature (6 ~ 32 {\\deg}C), relative\nhumidity (< 80%), and wind speed (< 5m/s)). Together with the current emission\nstandard, we identify a large number of the dirty (2.33%) or clean (74.92%)\nvehicles in the real world. Our results show that the ORRS measurements,\nassisted by the machine-learning-based ensemble model developed here, can\nrealize day-to-day supervision of on-road vehicle-specific emissions.

    "abstract": "Most existing methods for image inpainting focus on learning the intra-image\npriors from the known regions of the current input image to infer the content\nof the corrupted regions in the same image. While such methods perform well on\nimages with small corrupted regions, it is challenging for these methods to\ndeal with images with large corrupted area due to two potential limitations: 1)\nsuch methods tend to overfit each single training pair of images relying solely\non the intra-image prior knowledge learned from the limited known area; 2) the\ninter-image prior knowledge about the general distribution patterns of visual\nsemantics, which can be transferred across images sharing similar semantics, is\nnot exploited. In this paper, we propose the Generative Memory-Guided Semantic\nReasoning Model (GM-SRM), which not only learns the intra-image priors from the\nknown regions, but also distills the inter-image reasoning priors to infer the\ncontent of the corrupted regions. In particular, the proposed GM-SRM first\npre-learns a generative memory from the whole training data to capture the\nsemantic distribution patterns in a global view. Then the learned memory are\nleveraged to retrieve the matching inter-image priors for the current corrupted\nimage to perform semantic reasoning during image inpainting. While the\nintra-image priors are used for guaranteeing the pixel-level content\nconsistency, the inter-image priors are favorable for performing high-level\nsemantic reasoning, which is particularly effective for inferring semantic\ncontent for large corrupted area. Extensive experiments on Paris Street View,\nCelebA-HQ, and Places2 benchmarks demonstrate that our GM-SRM outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods for image inpainting in terms of both the visual\nquality and quantitative metrics.",

    "abstract": "Fourier transforms are an often necessary component in many computational\ntasks, and can be computed efficiently through the fast Fourier transform (FFT)\nalgorithm. However, many applications involve an underlying continuous signal,\nand a more natural choice would be to work with e.g. the Fourier series (FS)\ncoefficients in order to avoid the additional overhead of translating between\nthe analog and discrete domains. Unfortunately, there exists very little\nliterature and tools for the manipulation of FS coefficients from discrete\nsamples. This paper introduces a Python library called pyFFS for efficient FS\ncoefficient computation, convolution, and interpolation. While the libraries\nSciPy and NumPy provide efficient functionality for discrete Fourier transform\ncoefficients via the FFT algorithm, pyFFS addresses the computation of FS\ncoefficients through what we call the fast Fourier series (FFS). Moreover,\npyFFS includes an FS interpolation method based on the chirp Z-transform that\ncan make it more than an order of magnitude faster than the SciPy equivalent\nwhen one wishes to perform interpolation. GPU support through the CuPy library\nallows for further acceleration, e.g. an order of magnitude faster for\ncomputing the 2-D FS coefficients of 1000 x 1000 samples and nearly two orders\nof magnitude faster for 2-D interpolation.

The second\napproach is entirely new compared with the first approach and the existing\napproach. In our second approach, the specification language is partitioned\ninto a finite number of sets such that strings in different sets have different\nlengths. For each of the sets, a verifier is constructed to check if there\nexists a string in the set causing a violation of delay coobservability.

Situational awareness is a basic capability of humans\nthat has been deeply studied in fields like Psychology, Military, Aerospace,\nEducation, etc., but it has barely been considered in robotics, which has\nfocused on ideas such as sensing, perception, sensor fusion, state estimation,\nlocalization and mapping, spatial AI, etc. In our research, we connected the\nbroad multidisciplinary existing knowledge on situational awareness with its\ncounterpart in mobile robotics. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art\nrobotics algorithms, we analyze the situational awareness aspects that have\nbeen covered by them, and we discuss their missing points. We found out that\nthe existing robotics algorithms are still missing manifold important aspects\nof situational awareness. As a consequence, we conclude that these missing\nfeatures are limiting the performance of robotic situational awareness, and\nfurther research is needed to overcome this challenge. We see this as an\nopportunity, and provide our vision for future research on robotic situational\nawareness.",

    "abstract": "Currently, one of the most widely used protocols to secure cryptocurrency\nassets in centralized exchanges is categorizing wallets into cold and hot.\nWhile cold wallets hold user deposits, hot} wallets are responsible for\naddressing withdrawal requests. However, this method has some shortcomings such\nas: 1) availability of private keys in at least one cold device, and~2)\nexposure of all private keys to one trusted cold wallet admin. To overcome such\nissues, we design a new protocol for managing cold wallet assets by employing\nnative multi-signature schemes. The proposed cold wallet system, involves at\nleast two distinct devices and their corresponding admins for both wallet\ncreation and signature generation. The method ensures that no final private key\nis stored on any device. To this end, no individual authority can spend from\nexchange assets. Moreover, we provide details regarding practical\nimplementation of the proposed method and compare it against state-of-the-art.\nFurthermore, we extend the application of the proposed method to an scalable\nscenario where users are directly involved in wallet generation and signing\nprocess of cold wallets in an MPC manner.",

    "abstract": "We propose a stochastic modeling framework for 3D human pose triangulation\nand evaluate its performance across different datasets and spatial camera\narrangements. The common approach to 3D pose estimation is to first detect 2D\nkeypoints in images and then apply the triangulation from multiple views.\nHowever, the majority of existing triangulation models are limited to a single\ndataset, i.e. camera arrangement and their number. Moreover, they require known\ncamera parameters. The proposed stochastic pose triangulation model\nsuccessfully generalizes to different camera arrangements and between two\npublic datasets. In each step, we generate a set of 3D pose hypotheses obtained\nby triangulation from a random subset of views. The hypotheses are evaluated by\na neural network and the expectation of the triangulation error is minimized.\nThe key novelty is that the network learns to evaluate the poses without taking\ninto account the spatial camera arrangement, thus improving generalization.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that the proposed stochastic framework can also be\nused for fundamental matrix estimation, showing promising results towards\nrelative camera pose estimation from noisy keypoint correspondences.",

Discovering these pathways using traditional process mining\ntechniques and standard event logs may be difficult because the patient is\ninvolved in several highly independent clinical processes. Our objective is to\nexplore the potential of analyzing these pathways using an event log\nrepresentation reflecting the independent clinical processes. Our main research\nquestion is: How can we identify valuable insights by using a multi-entity\nevent data representation for clinical pathways of multi-morbid patients? Our\nmethod was built on the idea to represent multiple entities in event logs as\nevent graphs. The MIMIC-III data-set was used to evaluate the feasibility of\nthis approach. Several clinical entities were identified and then mapped into\nan event graph. Finally, multi-entity directly follows graphs were discovered\nby querying the event graph visualizing them. Our result shows that paths\ninvolving multiple entities include traditional process mining concepts not for\none clinical process but all involved processes. In addition, the relationship\nbetween activities of different clinical processes, which was not recognizable\nin traditional models, is visible in the event graph representation.",

We argue that an open citation index for\nthe humanities is desirable, for four reasons: it would greatly improve and\naccelerate the retrieval of sources, it would offer a way to interlink\ncollections across repositories (such as archives and libraries), it would\nfoster the adoption of metadata standards and best practices by all\nstakeholders (including publishers) and it would contribute research data to\nfields such as bibliometrics and science studies. We also suggest that the\ncitation index should be informed by a set of requirements relevant to the\nhumanities. We discuss four: source coverage must be comprehensive, including\nbooks and citations to primary sources; there needs to be chronological depth,\nas scholarship in the humanities remains relevant over time; the index should\nbe collection-driven, leveraging the accumulated thematic collections of\nspecialized research libraries; and it should be rich in context in order to\nallow for the qualification of each citation, for example by providing citation\nexcerpts. We detail the fit-for-purpose research infrastructure which can make\nthe humanities citation index a reality.

    "abstract": "Testing has been widely recognised as difficult for AI applications. This\npaper proposes a set of testing strategies for testing machine learning\napplications in the framework of the datamorphism testing methodology. In these\nstrategies, testing aims at exploring the data space of a classification or\nclustering application to discover the boundaries between classes that the\nmachine learning application defines. This enables the tester to understand\nprecisely the behaviour and function of the software under test. In the paper,\nthree variants of exploratory strategies are presented with the algorithms\nimplemented in the automated datamorphic testing tool Morphy. The correctness\nof these algorithms are formally proved. Their capability and cost of\ndiscovering borders between classes are evaluated via a set of controlled\nexperiments with manually designed subjects and a set of case studies with real\nmachine learning models.",

For good captioning results, the\ngeometry and position relations of different visual objects are often thought\nof as crucial information. Aiming to further promote image captioning by\ntransformers, this paper proposes an improved Geometry Attention Transformer\n(GAT) model. In order to further leverage geometric information, two novel\ngeometry-aware architectures are designed respectively for the encoder and\ndecoder in our GAT. Besides, this model includes the two work modules: 1) a\ngeometry gate-controlled self-attention refiner, for explicitly incorporating\nrelative spatial information into image region representations in encoding\nsteps, and 2) a group of position-LSTMs, for precisely informing the decoder of\nrelative word position in generating caption texts. The experiment comparisons\non the datasets MS COCO and Flickr30K show that our GAT is efficient, and it\ncould often outperform current state-of-the-art image captioning models.",

Although Learning from Demonstrations (LfD)\napproaches are among the preferred ways for an autonomous surgical system to\nlearn expert gestures, they require a high number of demonstrations and show\npoor generalization to the variable conditions of the surgical environment. In\nthis work, we propose an LfD methodology based on Generative Adversarial\nImitation Learning (GAIL) that is built on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\nsetting. GAIL combines generative adversarial networks to learn the\ndistribution of expert trajectories with a DRL setting to ensure generalisation\nof trajectories providing human-like behaviour. We consider automation of\ntissue retraction, a common RAMIS task that involves soft tissues manipulation\nto expose a region of interest. In our proposed methodology, a small set of\nexpert trajectories can be acquired through the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK)\nand used to train the proposed LfD method inside a simulated environment.\nResults indicate that our methodology can accomplish the tissue retraction task\nwith human-like behaviour while being more sample-efficient than the baseline\nDRL method. Towards the end, we show that the learnt policies can be\nsuccessfully transferred to the real robotic platform and deployed for soft\ntissue retraction on a synthetic phantom.",

    "abstract": "In the Internet of Things era, where we see many interconnected and\nheterogeneous mobile and fixed smart devices, distributing the intelligence\nfrom the cloud to the edge has become a necessity. Due to limited computational\nand communication capabilities, low memory and limited energy budget, bringing\nartificial intelligence algorithms to peripheral devices, such as the end-nodes\nof a sensor network, is a challenging task and requires the design of\ninnovative methods. In this work, we present PhiNets, a new scalable backbone\noptimized for deep-learning-based image processing on resource-constrained\nplatforms. PhiNets are based on inverted residual blocks specifically designed\nto decouple the computational cost, working memory, and parameter memory, thus\nexploiting all the available resources.

PhiNets reduce the parameter count of\n87% to 93% with respect to previous state-of-the-art models (EfficientNetv1,\nMobileNetv2) and achieve better performance with lower computational cost.\nMoreover, we demonstrate our approach on a prototype node based on a STM32H743\nmicrocontroller (MCU) with 2MB of internal Flash and 1MB of RAM and achieve\npower requirements in the order of 10 mW.

    "abstract": "Humans perform co-saliency detection by first summarizing the consensus\nknowledge in the whole group and then searching corresponding objects in each\nimage. Previous methods usually lack robustness, scalability, or stability for\nthe first process and simply fuse consensus features with image features for\nthe second process. In this paper, we propose a novel consensus-aware dynamic\nconvolution model to explicitly and effectively perform the \"summarize and\nsearch\" process. To summarize consensus image features, we first summarize\nrobust features for every single image using an effective pooling method and\nthen aggregate cross-image consensus cues via the self-attention mechanism. By\ndoing this, our model meets the scalability and stability requirements. Next,\nwe generate dynamic kernels from consensus features to encode the summarized\nconsensus knowledge. Two kinds of kernels are generated in a supplementary way\nto summarize fine-grained image-specific consensus object cues and the coarse\ngroup-wise common knowledge, respectively. Then, we can effectively perform\nobject searching by employing dynamic convolution at multiple scales. Besides,\na novel and effective data synthesis method is also proposed to train our\nnetwork. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets verify the\neffectiveness of our proposed method. Our code and saliency maps are available\nat \\url{https://github.com/nnizhang/CADC}.",

Unlike existing solutions that directly operate over\noriginal PDEs, BINet learns to solve, as a proxy, associated boundary integral\nequations using neural networks. The benefits are three-fold. Firstly, only the\nboundary conditions need to be fitted since the PDE can be automatically\nsatisfied with single or double layer representations according to the\npotential theory. Secondly, the dimension of the boundary integral equations is\ntypically smaller, and as such, the sample complexity can be reduced\nsignificantly. Lastly, in the proposed method, all differential operators of\nthe original PDEs have been removed, hence the numerical efficiency and\nstability are improved. Adopting neural tangent kernel (NTK) techniques, we\nprovide proof of the convergence of BINets in the limit that the width of the\nneural network goes to infinity. Extensive numerical experiments show that,\nwithout calculating high-order derivatives, BINet is much easier to train and\nusually gives more accurate solutions, especially in the cases that the\nboundary conditions are not smooth enough. Further, BINet outperforms strong\nbaselines for both one single PDE and parameterized PDEs in the bounded and\nunbounded domains.",

In order to increase flexibility and reduce deployment and maintenance\ncosts, many such applications consider battery-powered or energy-harvesting\nnetworks, which bring additional limitations on the energy consumption of the\nwireless network. Specifically, the operation of battery-powered or\nenergy-harvesting wireless communication networks needs to guarantee (i)\nefficient communication between nodes and (ii) preservation of available\nenergy. Motivated by these novel requirements, in this paper, we present and\nanalyze a novel distributed average consensus algorithm, which (i) operates\nexclusively on quantized values (in order to guarantee efficient communication\nand data storage), and (ii) relies on event-driven updates (in order to reduce\nenergy consumption, communication bandwidth, network congestion, and/or\nprocessor usage). We characterize the properties of the proposed algorithm and\nshow that its execution, on any time-invariant and strongly connected digraph,\nwill allow all nodes to reach, in finite time, a common consensus value that is\nequal to the exact average (represented as the ratio of two quantized values).\nFurthermore, we show that our algorithm allows each node to cease transmissions\nonce the exact average of the initial quantized values has been reached (in\norder to preserve its battery energy). Then, we present upper bounds on (i) the\nnumber of transmissions and computations each node has to perform during the\nexecution of the algorithm, and (ii) the memory and energy requirements of each\nnode in order for the algorithm to be executed.",

In this work, we examine questions posed about open source software\nlicensing using data from the following Stack Exchange sites: Stack Overflow,\nSoftware Engineering, Open Source and Law.

In this study, we build a variational autoencoder (VAE)\nwith SNN to enable image generation. VAE is known for its stability among\ngenerative models; recently, its quality advanced. In vanilla VAE, the latent\nspace is represented as a normal distribution, and floating-point calculations\nare required in sampling.

Therefore, we constructed the latent\nspace with an autoregressive SNN model, and randomly selected samples from its\noutput to sample the latent variables. This allows the latent variables to\nfollow the Bernoulli process and allows variational learning. Thus, we build\nthe Fully Spiking Variational Autoencoder where all modules are constructed\nwith SNN. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to build a VAE only\nwith SNN layers.

However, synthesizing such reactive motions in human-human interactions\nis a challenging task due to the many different ways two humans can interact.\nWhile there are a number of successful researches in adapting the generative\nadversarial network (GAN) in synthesizing single human actions, there are very\nfew on modelling human-human interactions. In this paper, we propose a\nsemi-supervised GAN system that synthesizes the reactive motion of a character\ngiven the active motion from another character. Our key insights are two-fold.\nFirst, to effectively encode the complicated spatial-temporal information of a\nhuman motion, we empower the generator with a part-based long short-term memory\n(LSTM) module, such that the temporal movement of different limbs can be\neffectively modelled. We further include an attention module such that the\ntemporal significance of the interaction can be learned, which enhances the\ntemporal alignment of the active-reactive motion pair. Second, as the reactive\nmotion of different types of interactions can be significantly different, we\nintroduce a discriminator that not only tells if the generated movement is\nrealistic or not, but also tells the class label of the interaction. This\nallows the use of such labels in supervising the training of the generator. We\nexperiment with the SBU and the HHOI datasets. The high quality of the\nsynthetic motion demonstrates the effective design of our generator, and the\ndiscriminability of the synthesis also demonstrates the strength of our\ndiscriminator.",

We show that our system based on\nReinforcement Learning is able to automatically learn a very efficient strategy\nto reduce the traffic on the cellular network, without relying on any\nadditional context information about the opportunistic network. Our solution\nachieves a higher level of offloading with respect to other state-of-the-art\napproaches, in a range of different mobility settings. Moreover, we show that a\nmore refined learning solution, based on the Actor-Critic algorithm, is\nsignificantly more efficient than a simpler solution based on Q-learning.",

    "abstract": "Many systems today rely heavily on virtual private network (VPN) technology\nto connect networks and protect their services on the Internet. While prior\nstudies compare the performance of different implementations, they do not\nconsider adversarial settings. To address this gap, we evaluate the resilience\nof VPN implementations to flooding-based denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. We\nfocus on a class of stateless flooding attacks, which are particularly\nthreatening to real connections, as they can be carried out by an off-path\nattacker using spoofed IP addresses. We have implemented various attacks to\nevaluate DoS resilience for three major open-source VPN solutions, with\nsurprising results: On high-performance hardware with a $40\\,\\mathrm{Gb/s}$\ninterface, data transfer over established WireGuard connections can be fully\ndenied with $700\\,\\mathrm{Mb/s}$ of attack traffic. For strongSwan (IPsec), an\nadversary can block any legitimate connections from being established using\nonly $75\\,\\mathrm{Mb/s}$ of attack traffic. OpenVPN can be overwhelmed with\n$100\\,\\mathrm{Mb/s}$ of flood traffic denying data transfer through the VPN\nconnection as well as connection establishment completely. Further analysis has\nrevealed implementation bugs and major inefficiencies in the implementations\nrelated to concurrency aspects. These findings demonstrate a need for more\nadversarial testing of VPN implementations with respect to DoS resilience.",

    "abstract": "Among the various modes of communication in social media, the use of Internet\nmemes has emerged as a powerful means to convey political, psychological, and\nsocio-cultural opinions. Although memes are typically humorous in nature,\nrecent days have witnessed a proliferation of harmful memes targeted to abuse\nvarious social entities. As most harmful memes are highly satirical and\nabstruse without appropriate contexts, off-the-shelf multimodal models may not\nbe adequate to understand their underlying semantics. In this work, we propose\ntwo novel problem formulations: detecting harmful memes and the social entities\nthat these harmful memes target. To this end, we present HarMeme, the first\nbenchmark dataset, containing 3,544 memes related to COVID-19. Each meme went\nthrough a rigorous two-stage annotation process. In the first stage, we labeled\na meme as very harmful, partially harmful, or harmless; in the second stage, we\nfurther annotated the type of target(s) that each harmful meme points to:\nindividual, organization, community, or society/general public/other. The\nevaluation results using ten unimodal and multimodal models highlight the\nimportance of using multimodal signals for both tasks. We further discuss the\nlimitations of these models and we argue that more research is needed to\naddress these problems.",

Under the assumption that\nthe fading channel follows a stationary complex Gaussian process, as for\nRayleigh and Rician fading models, the optimal predictor is linear, and it can\nbe directly computed from the Doppler spectrum via standard linear minimum mean\nsquared error (LMMSE) estimation.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Evolutionary Strategies were actively explored in robotic\ntasks for policy search as they provide a simpler alternative to reinforcement\nlearning algorithms. However, this class of algorithms is often claimed to be\nextremely sample-inefficient. On the other hand, there is a growing interest in\nDifferentiable Robot Simulators (DRS) as they potentially can find successful\npolicies with only a handful of trajectories. But the resulting gradient is not\nalways useful for the first-order optimization. In this work, we demonstrate\nhow DRS gradient can be used in conjunction with Evolutionary Strategies.\nPreliminary results suggest that this combination can reduce sample complexity\nof Evolutionary Strategies by 3x-5x times in both simulation and the real\nworld.",

    "abstract": "Optimal feedback control (OFC) is a theory from the motor control literature\nthat explains how humans move their body to achieve a certain goal, e.g.,\npointing with the finger. OFC is based on the assumption that humans aim to\ncontrol their body optimally, within the constraints imposed by body,\nenvironment, and task. In this paper, we explain how this theory can be applied\nto understanding Human-Computer Interaction. We propose that in this case, the\ndynamics of the human body and computer can be interpreted as a single\ndynamical system. The state of this system is controlled by the user via muscle\ncontrol signals, and estimated from observations. Between-trial variability\narises from signal-dependent control noise and observation noise. We compare\nfour different models from optimal control theory and evaluate to what degree\nthese models can replicate movements in the case of mouse pointing. We\nintroduce a procedure to identify parameters that best explain observed user\nbehavior, and show how these parameters can be used to gain insights regarding\nuser characteristics and preferences. We conclude that OFC presents a powerful\nframework for HCI to understand and simulate motion of the human body and of\nthe interface on a moment by moment basis.",

The work is a computational extension\nof our earlier theoretical work (Duong et al., 2021) that extends existing\nKirchhoff-Love shell theory to incorporate the in-plane bending resistance of\ninitially straight or curved fibers. The formulation requires only displacement\ndegrees-of-freedom to capture all mentioned modes of deformation. To this end,\nisogeometric shape functions are used in order to satisfy the required\n$C^1$-continuity for bending across element boundaries. The proposed\nformulation can admit a wide range of material models, such as surface\nhyperelasticity that does not require any explicit thickness integration. To\ndeal with possible material instability due to fiber compression, a\nstabilization scheme is added. Several benchmark examples are used to\ndemonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed computational\nformulation.",

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D object detection has recently shown promising results, however\nthere remain challenging problems. One of those is the lack of invariance to\ndifferent camera intrinsic parameters, which can be observed across different\n3D object datasets. Little effort has been made to exploit the combination of\nheterogeneous 3D object datasets. In contrast to general intuition, we show\nthat more data does not automatically guarantee a better performance, but\nrather, methods need to have a degree of 'camera independence' in order to\nbenefit from large and heterogeneous training data. In this paper we propose a\ncategory-level pose estimation method based on instance segmentation, using\ncamera independent geometric reasoning to cope with the varying camera\nviewpoints and intrinsics of different datasets. Every pixel of an instance\npredicts the object dimensions, the 3D object reference points projected in 2D\nimage space and, optionally, the local viewing angle. Camera intrinsics are\nonly used outside of the learned network to lift the predicted 2D reference\npoints to 3D. We surpass camera independent methods on the challenging KITTI3D\nbenchmark and show the key benefits compared to camera dependent methods.",

Very simple: by learning.\nCan we do the same for software?

Driver\nmonitoring (DM) is a topic of growing interest in the automotive industry, and\nit will remain relevant for all vehicles that are not fully autonomous, and\nthus for decades for the average vehicle owner. The present paper focuses on\nthe first step of DM, which consists in characterizing the state of the driver.\nSince DM will be increasingly linked to driving automation (DA), this paper\npresents a clear view of the role of DM at each of the six SAE levels of DA.\nThis paper surveys the state of the art of DM, and then synthesizes it,\nproviding a unique, structured, polychotomous view of the many characterization\ntechniques of DM. Informed by the survey, the paper characterizes the driver\nstate along the five main dimensions--called here \"(sub)states\"--of drowsiness,\nmental workload, distraction, emotions, and under the influence. The\npolychotomous view of DM is presented through a pair of interlocked tables that\nrelate these states to their indicators (e.g., the eye-blink rate) and the\nsensors that can access each of these indicators (e.g., a camera). The tables\nfactor in not only the effects linked directly to the driver, but also those\nlinked to the (driven) vehicle and the (driving) environment.

    "abstract": "Edge computing devices inherently face tight resource constraints, which is\nespecially apparent when deploying Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with high memory\nand compute demands. FPGAs are commonly available in edge devices. Since these\nreconfigurable circuits can achieve higher throughput and lower power\nconsumption than general purpose processors, they are especially well-suited\nfor DNN acceleration. However, existing solutions for designing FPGA-based DNN\naccelerators for edge devices come with high development overheads, given the\ncost of repeated FPGA synthesis passes, reimplementation in a Hardware\nDescription Language (HDL) of the simulated design, and accelerator system\nintegration.\nIn this paper we propose SECDA, a new hardware/software co-design methodology\nto reduce design time of optimized DNN inference accelerators on edge devices\nwith FPGAs. SECDA combines cost-effective SystemC simulation with hardware\nexecution, streamlining design space exploration and the development process\nvia reduced design evaluation time. As a case study, we use SECDA to\nefficiently develop two different DNN accelerator designs on a PYNQ-Z1 board, a\nplatform that includes an edge FPGA. We quickly and iteratively explore the\nsystem's hardware/software stack, while identifying and mitigating performance\nbottlenecks. We evaluate the two accelerator designs with four common DNN\nmodels, achieving an average performance speedup across models of up to\n3.5$\\times$ with a 2.9$\\times$ reduction in energy consumption over CPU-only\ninference.

    "title": "Robustly Removing Deep Sea Lighting Effects for Visual Mapping of  Abyssal Plains",
    "abstract": "The majority of Earth's surface lies deep in the oceans, where no surface\nlight reaches. Robots diving down to great depths must bring light sources that\ncreate moving illumination patterns in the darkness, such that the same 3D\npoint appears with different color in each image. On top, scattering and\nattenuation of light in the water makes images appear foggy and typically\nblueish, the degradation depending on each pixel's distance to its observed\nseafloor patch, on the local composition of the water and the relative poses\nand cones of the light sources. Consequently, visual mapping, including image\nmatching and surface albedo estimation, severely suffers from the effects that\nco-moving light sources produce, and larger mosaic maps from photos are often\ndominated by lighting effects that obscure the actual seafloor structure. In\nthis contribution a practical approach to estimating and compensating these\nlighting effects on predominantly homogeneous, flat seafloor regions, as can be\nfound in the Abyssal plains of our oceans, is presented. The method is\nessentially parameter-free and intended as a preprocessing step to facilitate\nvisual mapping, but already produces convincing lighting artefact compensation\nup to a global white balance factor. It does not require to be trained\nbeforehand on huge sets of annotated images, which are not available for the\ndeep sea. Rather, we motivate our work by physical models of light propagation,\nperform robust statistics-based estimates of additive and multiplicative\nnuisances that avoid explicit parameters for light, camera, water or scene,\ndiscuss the breakdown point of the algorithms and show results on imagery\ncaptured by robots in several kilometer water depth.",

    "abstract": "Empirical observations often consist of anomalies (or outliers) that\ncontaminate the data. Accurate identification of anomalous samples is crucial\nfor the success of downstream data analysis tasks. To automatically identify\nanomalies, we propose a new type of autoencoder (AE) which we term\nProbabilistic Robust autoencoder (PRAE). PRAE is designed to simultaneously\nremove outliers and identify a low-dimensional representation for the inlier\nsamples. We first describe Robust AE (RAE) as a model that aims to split the\ndata to inlier samples from which a low dimensional representation is learned\nvia an AE, and anomalous (outlier) samples that are excluded as they do not fit\nthe low dimensional representation. Robust AE minimizes the reconstruction of\nthe AE while attempting to incorporate as many observations as possible. This\ncould be realized by subtracting from the reconstruction term an $\\ell_0$ norm\ncounting the number of selected observations. Since the $\\ell_0$ norm is not\ndifferentiable, we propose two probabilistic relaxations for the RAE approach\nand demonstrate that they can effectively identify anomalies. We prove that the\nsolution to PRAE is equivalent to the solution of RAE and demonstrate using\nextensive simulations that PRAE is at par with state-of-the-art methods for\nanomaly detection.",

    "abstract": "A heapable sequence is a sequence of numbers that can be arranged in a\n\"min-heap data structure\". Finding a longest heapable subsequence of a given\nsequence was proposed by Byers, Heeringa, Mitzenmacher, and Zervas (ANALCO\n2011) as a generalization of the well-studied longest increasing subsequence\nproblem and its complexity still remains open. An equivalent formulation of the\nlongest heapable subsequence problem is that of finding a maximum-sized binary\ntree in a given permutation directed acyclic graph (permutation DAG). In this\nwork, we study parameterized algorithms for both longest heapable subsequence\nas well as maximum-sized binary tree. We show the following results:\n1. The longest heapable subsequence problem can be solved in\n$k^{O(\\log{k})}n$ time, where $k$ is the number of distinct values in the input\nsequence. We introduce the \"alphabet size\" as a new parameter in the study of\ncomputational problems in permutation DAGs. Our result on longest heapable\nsubsequence implies that the maximum-sized binary tree problem in a given\npermutation DAG is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the alphabet\nsize.\n2. We show that the alphabet size with respect to a fixed topological\nordering can be computed in polynomial time, admits a min-max relation, and has\na polyhedral description.\n3. We design a fixed-parameter algorithm with run-time $w^{O(w)}n$ for the\nmaximum-sized binary tree problem in undirected graphs when parameterized by\ntreewidth $w$.\nOur results make progress towards understanding the complexity of the longest\nheapable subsequence and maximum-sized binary tree in permutation DAGs from the\nperspective of parameterized algorithms. We believe that the parameter alphabet\nsize that we introduce is likely to be useful in the context of optimization\nproblems defined over permutation DAGs.",

We identify that the long-tail distribution of visual concepts and\nunequal importance of reasoning steps in real data are the two key obstacles\nthat limit the models' real-world potentials. To address these challenges, we\npropose a new paradigm, Calibrating Concepts and Operations (CCO), which\nenables neural symbolic models to capture underlying data characteristics and\nto reason with hierarchical importance.

Our experiments show CCO substantially boosts\nthe performance of neural symbolic methods on real images. By evaluating models\non the real world dataset GQA, CCO helps the neural symbolic method NSCL\noutperforms its vanilla counterpart by 9.1% (from 47.0% to 56.1%); this result\nalso largely reduces the performance gap between symbolic and non-symbolic\nmethods. Additionally, we create a perturbed test set for better understanding\nand analyzing model performance on real images. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Lizw14/CaliCO.git .",

Caution must be exercised while designing natural language\nprocessing (NLP) systems to prevent systems from inadvertently perpetuating\nableist bias against people with disabilities, i.e., prejudice that favors\nthose with typical abilities. We report on various analyses based on word\npredictions of a large-scale BERT language model.

    "abstract": "In the absence of vaccines or medicines to stop COVID-19, one of the\neffective methods to slow the spread of the coronavirus and reduce the\noverloading of healthcare is to wear a face mask. Nevertheless, to mandate the\nuse of face masks or coverings in public areas, additional human resources are\nrequired, which is tedious and attention-intensive. To automate the monitoring\nprocess, one of the promising solutions is to leverage existing object\ndetection models to detect the faces with or without masks. As such, security\nofficers do not have to stare at the monitoring devices or crowds, and only\nhave to deal with the alerts triggered by the detection of faces without masks.\nExisting object detection models usually focus on designing the CNN-based\nnetwork architectures for extracting discriminative features. However, the size\nof training datasets of face mask detection is small, while the difference\nbetween faces with and without masks is subtle. Therefore, in this paper, we\npropose a face mask detection framework that uses the context attention module\nto enable the effective attention of the feed-forward convolution neural\nnetwork by adapting their attention maps feature refinement. Moreover, we\nfurther propose an anchor-free detector with Triplet-Consistency Representation\nLearning by integrating the consistency loss and the triplet loss to deal with\nthe small-scale training data and the similarity between masks and occlusions.\nExtensive experimental results show that our method outperforms the other\nstate-of-the-art methods.

    "title": "Consistent Explanations by Contrastive Learning",
    "abstract": "Understanding and explaining the decisions of neural networks are critical to\nbuilding trust, rather than relying on them as black box algorithms. Post-hoc\nevaluation techniques, such as Grad-CAM, enable humans to inspect the spatial\nregions responsible for a particular network decision. However, it is shown\nthat such explanations are not always consistent with human priors, such as\nconsistency across image transformations. Given an interpretation algorithm,\ne.g., Grad-CAM, we introduce a novel training method to train the model to\nproduce more consistent explanations. Since obtaining the ground truth for a\ndesired model interpretation is not a well-defined task, we adopt ideas from\ncontrastive self-supervised learning and apply them to the interpretations of\nthe model rather than its embeddings. Explicitly training the network to\nproduce more reasonable interpretations and subsequently evaluating those\ninterpretations will enhance our ability to trust the network. We show that our\nmethod, Contrastive Grad-CAM Consistency (CGC), results in Grad-CAM\ninterpretation heatmaps that are consistent with human annotations while still\nachieving comparable classification accuracy. Moreover, since our method can be\nseen as a form of regularizer, on limited-data fine-grained classification\nsettings, our method outperforms the baseline classification accuracy on\nCaltech-Birds, Stanford Cars, VGG Flowers, and FGVC-Aircraft datasets. In\naddition, because our method does not rely on annotations, it allows for the\nincorporation of unlabeled data into training, which enables better\ngeneralization of the model.

By using recent advances in\ncomparing neural representations, we explore in this direction by comparing a\nconstrastive self-supervised algorithm (SimCLR) to supervision for simple image\ndata in a common architecture. We find that the methods learn similar\nintermediate representations through dissimilar means, and that the\nrepresentations diverge rapidly in the final few layers.

Such tracking promises important advances in biology and\nbiomedicine. Modern tracking models depend critically on labor-intensive\nannotated datasets of primary landmarks by non-expert humans. However, such\nannotation approaches can be costly and impractical for secondary landmarks,\nthat is, ones that reflect fine-grained geometry of animals, and that are often\nspecific to customized behavioral tasks. Due to visual and geometric ambiguity,\nnonexperts are often not qualified for secondary landmark annotation, which can\nrequire anatomical and zoological knowledge. These barriers significantly\nimpede downstream behavioral studies because the learned tracking models\nexhibit limited generalizability. We hypothesize that there exists a shared\nrepresentation between the primary and secondary landmarks because the range of\nmotion of the secondary landmarks can be approximately spanned by that of the\nprimary landmarks. We present a method to learn this spatial relationship of\nthe primary and secondary landmarks in three dimensional space, which can, in\nturn, self-supervise the secondary landmark detector.

    "abstract": "Optimally extracting the advantages available from reconfigurable intelligent\nsurfaces (RISs) in wireless communications systems requires estimation of the\nchannels to and from the RIS. The process of determining these channels is\ncomplicated by the fact that the RIS is typically composed of passive elements\nwithout any data processing capabilities, and thus the channels must be\nestimated indirectly by a non-colocated device, typically a controlling base\nstation. In this article, we examine channel estimation for RIS-based systems\nfrom a fundamental viewpoint. We study various possible channel models and the\nidentifiability of the models as a function of the available pilot data and\nbehavior of the RIS during training. In particular, we consider situations with\nand without line-of-sight propagation, single- and multiple-antenna\nconfigurations for the users and base station, correlated and sparse channel\nmodels, single-carrier and wideband OFDM scenarios, availability of direct\nlinks between the users and base station, exploitation of prior information, as\nwell as a number of other special cases. We further conduct numerical\ncomparisons of achievable performance for various channel models using the\nrelevant Cramer-Rao bounds.",

With this, atoms of the logic are no longer interpreted as truth,\nbut as information or resources. This interpretation makes linear logic a\nuseful tool for formalisation in mathematics and computer science. Linear logic\nhas, for example, found applications in proof theory, quantum logic, and the\ntheory of programming languages. A central problem of the logic is the question\nwhether a given list of formulas is provable with the calculus. In the research\nregarding the complexity of this problem, some results were achieved, but other\nquestions are still open. To present these questions and give new perspectives,\nthis thesis consists of three main parts which build on each other: We present\nthe syntax, proof theory, and various approaches to a semantics for linear\nlogic. Here already, we will meet some open research questions. We present the\ncurrent state of the complexity-theoretic characterization of the most\nimportant fragments of linear logic. Here, further research problems are\npresented and it becomes apparent that until now, the results have all made use\nof different approaches. We prove an original complexity characterization of a\nfragment of the logic and present ideas for a new, structural approach to the\nexamination of provability in linear logic.",

    "abstract": "It is desirable to combine the expressive power of deep learning with\nGaussian Process (GP) in one expressive Bayesian learning model. Deep kernel\nlearning proposed in [1] showed success in adopting a deep network for feature\nextraction followed by a GP used as function model. Recently, [2] suggested\nthat the deterministic nature of feature extractor may lead to overfitting\nwhile the replacement with a Bayesian network seemed to cure it. Here, we\npropose the conditional Deep Gaussian Process (DGP) in which the intermediate\nGPs in hierarchical composition are supported by the hyperdata and the exposed\nGP remains zero mean. Motivated by the inducing points in sparse GP, the\nhyperdata also play the role of function supports, but are hyperparameters\nrather than random variables. We use the moment matching method [3] to\napproximate the marginal prior for conditional DGP with a GP carrying an\neffective kernel. Thus, as in empirical Bayes, the hyperdata are learned by\noptimizing the approximate marginal likelihood which implicitly depends on the\nhyperdata via the kernel. We shall show the equivalence with the deep kernel\nlearning in the limit of dense hyperdata in latent space. However, the\nconditional DGP and the corresponding approximate inference enjoy the benefit\nof being more Bayesian than deep kernel learning. Preliminary extrapolation\nresults demonstrate expressive power of the proposed model compared with GP\nkernel composition, DGP variational inference, and deep kernel learning. We\nalso address the non-Gaussian aspect of our model as well as way of upgrading\nto a full Bayes inference.",

    "title": "Leveraging Low-Distortion Target Estimates for Improved Speech  Enhancement",
    "abstract": "A promising approach for multi-microphone speech separation involves two deep\nneural networks (DNN), where the predicted target speech from the first DNN is\nused to compute signal statistics for time-invariant minimum variance\ndistortionless response (MVDR) beamforming, and the MVDR result is then used as\nextra features for the second DNN to predict target speech. Previous studies\nsuggested that the MVDR result can provide complementary information for the\nsecond DNN to better predict target speech. However, on fixed-geometry arrays,\nboth DNNs can take in, for example, the real and imaginary (RI) components of\nthe multi-channel mixture as features to leverage the spatial and spectral\ninformation for enhancement. It is not explained clearly why the linear MVDR\nresult can be complementary and why it is still needed, considering that the\nDNNs and the beamformer use the same input, and the DNNs perform non-linear\nfiltering and could render the linear filtering of MVDR unnecessary. Similarly,\nin monaural cases, one can replace the MVDR beamformer with a monaural weighted\nprediction error (WPE) filter. Although the linear WPE filter and the DNNs use\nthe same mixture RI components as input, the WPE result is found to\nsignificantly improve the second DNN. This study provides a novel explanation\nfrom the perspective of the low-distortion nature of such algorithms, and finds\nthat they can consistently improve phase estimation. Equipped with this\nunderstanding, we investigate several low-distortion target estimation\nalgorithms including several beamformers, WPE, forward convolutive prediction,\nand their combinations, and use their results as extra features to train the\nsecond network to achieve better enhancement. Evaluation results on single- and\nmulti-microphone speech dereverberation and enhancement tasks indicate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach, and the validity of the proposed view.",

Here, we show that this specific\nway of formulating the objective function is the source of severe limitations\nin the PINN approach when applied to different kinds of PDEs. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a versatile framework that can tackle both inverse and\nforward problems. The framework is adept at multi-fidelity data fusion and can\nseamlessly constrain the governing physics equations with proper initial and\nboundary conditions. The backbone of the proposed framework is a nonlinear,\nequality-constrained optimization problem formulation aimed at minimizing a\nloss functional, where an augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) is used to formally\nconvert a constrained-optimization problem into an unconstrained-optimization\nproblem. We implement the ALM within a stochastic, gradient-descent type\ntraining algorithm in a way that scrupulously focuses on meeting the\nconstraints without sacrificing other loss terms.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the research landscape of machine learning in medical\nimaging has changed drastically from supervised to semi-, weakly- or\nunsupervised methods. This is mainly due to the fact that ground-truth labels\nare time-consuming and expensive to obtain manually. Generating labels from\npatient metadata might be feasible but it suffers from user-originated errors\nwhich introduce biases. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach for\nautomatically clustering and categorizing large-scale medical image datasets,\nwith a focus on cardiac MR images, and without using any labels. We\ninvestigated the end-to-end training using both class-balanced and imbalanced\nlarge-scale datasets. Our method was able to create clusters with high purity\nand achieved over 0.99 cluster purity on these datasets. The results\ndemonstrate the potential of the proposed method for categorizing unstructured\nlarge medical databases, such as organizing clinical PACS systems in hospitals.",

    "abstract": "We consider two or more forecasters each making a sequence of predictions\nover time and tackle the problem of how to compare them -- either online or\npost-hoc. In fields ranging from meteorology to sports, forecasters make\npredictions on different events or quantities over time, and this work\ndescribes how to compare them in a statistically rigorous manner. Specifically,\nwe design a nonasymptotic sequential inference procedure for estimating the\ntime-varying difference in forecast quality when using a relatively large class\nof scoring rules (bounded scores with a linear equivalent). The resulting\nconfidence intervals can be continuously monitored and yield statistically\nvalid comparisons at arbitrary data-dependent stopping times (\"anytime-valid\");\nthis is enabled by adapting recent variance-adaptive confidence sequences (CS)\nto our setting. In the spirit of Shafer and Vovk's game-theoretic probability,\nthe coverage guarantees for our CSs are also distribution-free, in the sense\nthat they make no distributional assumptions whatsoever on the forecasts or\noutcomes. Additionally, in contrast to a recent preprint by Henzi and Ziegel,\nwe show how to sequentially test a weak null hypothesis about whether one\nforecaster outperforms another on average over time, by designing different\ne-processes that quantify the evidence at any stopping time. We examine the\nvalidity of our methods over their fixed-time and asymptotic counterparts in\nsynthetic experiments and demonstrate their effectiveness in real-data\nsettings, including comparing probability forecasts on Major League Baseball\n(MLB) games and comparing statistical postprocessing methods for ensemble\nweather forecasts.",

    "abstract": "The conventional design of wireless communication systems typically relies on\nestablished mathematical models that capture the characteristics of different\ncommunication modules. Unfortunately, such design cannot be easily and directly\napplied to future wireless networks, which will be characterized by large-scale\nultra-dense networks whose design complexity scales exponentially with the\nnetwork size. Furthermore, such networks will vary dynamically in a significant\nway, which makes it intractable to develop comprehensive analytical models.\nRecently, deep learning-based approaches have emerged as potential alternatives\nfor designing complex and dynamic wireless systems. However, existing\nlearning-based methods have limited capabilities to scale with the problem size\nand to generalize with varying network settings. In this paper, we propose a\nscalable and generalizable neural calibration framework for future wireless\nsystem design, where a neural network is adopted to calibrate the input of\nconventional model-based algorithms. Specifically, the backbone of a\ntraditional time-efficient algorithm is integrated with deep neural networks to\nachieve a high computational efficiency, while enjoying enhanced performance.\nThe permutation equivariance property, carried out by the topological structure\nof wireless systems, is furthermore utilized to develop a generalizable neural\nnetwork architecture. The proposed neural calibration framework is applied to\nsolve challenging resource management problems in massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) systems.

    "abstract": "Sound event localization and detection (SELD) consists of two subtasks, which\nare sound event detection and direction-of-arrival estimation. While sound\nevent detection mainly relies on time-frequency patterns to distinguish\ndifferent sound classes, direction-of-arrival estimation uses amplitude and/or\nphase differences between microphones to estimate source directions. As a\nresult, it is often difficult to jointly optimize these two subtasks. We\npropose a novel feature called Spatial cue-Augmented Log-SpectrogrAm (SALSA)\nwith exact time-frequency mapping between the signal power and the source\ndirectional cues, which is crucial for resolving overlapping sound sources. The\nSALSA feature consists of multichannel log-spectrograms stacked along with the\nnormalized principal eigenvector of the spatial covariance matrix at each\ncorresponding time-frequency bin. Depending on the microphone array format, the\nprincipal eigenvector can be normalized differently to extract amplitude and/or\nphase differences between the microphones. As a result, SALSA features are\napplicable for different microphone array formats such as first-order\nambisonics (FOA) and multichannel microphone array (MIC). Experimental results\non the TAU-NIGENS Spatial Sound Events 2021 dataset with directional\ninterferences showed that SALSA features outperformed other state-of-the-art\nfeatures. Specifically, the use of SALSA features in the FOA format increased\nthe F1 score and localization recall by 6% each, compared to the multichannel\nlog-mel spectrograms with intensity vectors. For the MIC format, using SALSA\nfeatures increased F1 score and localization recall by 16% and 7%,\nrespectively, compared to using multichannel log-mel spectrograms with\ngeneralized cross-correlation spectra. Our ensemble model trained on SALSA\nfeatures ranked second in the team category of the SELD task in the 2021 DCASE\nChallenge.",

TyXe then\nprovides modular choices for canonical priors, variational guides, inference\ntechniques, and layer selections for a Bayesian treatment of the specified\narchitecture. Sampling tricks for variance reduction, such as local\nreparameterization or flipout, are implemented as effect handlers, which can be\napplied independently of other specifications. We showcase the ease of use of\nTyXe to explore Bayesian versions of popular models from various libraries: toy\nregression with a pure Pytorch neural network; large-scale image classification\nwith torchvision ResNets; graph neural networks based on DGL; and Neural\nRadiance Fields built on top of Pytorch3D.

    "abstract": "The training of sparse neural networks is becoming an increasingly important\ntool for reducing the computational footprint of models at training and\nevaluation, as well enabling the effective scaling up of models. Whereas much\nwork over the years has been dedicated to specialised pruning techniques,\nlittle attention has been paid to the inherent effect of gradient based\ntraining on model sparsity. In this work, we introduce Powerpropagation, a new\nweight-parameterisation for neural networks that leads to inherently sparse\nmodels. Exploiting the behaviour of gradient descent, our method gives rise to\nweight updates exhibiting a \"rich get richer\" dynamic, leaving low-magnitude\nparameters largely unaffected by learning. Models trained in this manner\nexhibit similar performance, but have a distribution with markedly higher\ndensity at zero, allowing more parameters to be pruned safely. Powerpropagation\nis general, intuitive, cheap and straight-forward to implement and can readily\nbe combined with various other techniques. To highlight its versatility, we\nexplore it in two very different settings: Firstly, following a recent line of\nwork, we investigate its effect on sparse training for resource-constrained\nsettings. Here, we combine Powerpropagation with a traditional weight-pruning\ntechnique as well as recent state-of-the-art sparse-to-sparse algorithms,\nshowing superior performance on the ImageNet benchmark. Secondly, we advocate\nthe use of sparsity in overcoming catastrophic forgetting, where compressed\nrepresentations allow accommodating a large number of tasks at fixed model\ncapacity.

    "title": "Score-Based Generative Classifiers",
    "abstract": "The tremendous success of generative models in recent years raises the\nquestion whether they can also be used to perform classification. Generative\nmodels have been used as adversarially robust classifiers on simple datasets\nsuch as MNIST, but this robustness has not been observed on more complex\ndatasets like CIFAR-10. Additionally, on natural image datasets, previous\nresults have suggested a trade-off between the likelihood of the data and\nclassification accuracy. In this work, we investigate score-based generative\nmodels as classifiers for natural images. We show that these models not only\nobtain competitive likelihood values but simultaneously achieve\nstate-of-the-art classification accuracy for generative classifiers on\nCIFAR-10. Nevertheless, we find that these models are only slightly, if at all,\nmore robust than discriminative baseline models on out-of-distribution tasks\nbased on common image corruptions. Similarly and contrary to prior results, we\nfind that score-based are prone to worst-case distribution shifts in the form\nof adversarial perturbations. Our work highlights that score-based generative\nmodels are closing the gap in classification accuracy compared to standard\ndiscriminative models. While they do not yet deliver on the promise of\nadversarial and out-of-domain robustness, they provide a different approach to\nclassification that warrants further research.",

    "abstract": "Plug-and-Play optimization recently emerged as a powerful technique for\nsolving inverse problems by plugging a denoiser into a classical optimization\nalgorithm. The denoiser accounts for the regularization and therefore\nimplicitly determines the prior knowledge on the data, hence replacing typical\nhandcrafted priors. In this paper, we extend the concept of plug-and-play\noptimization to use denoisers that can be parameterized for non-constant noise\nvariance. In that aim, we introduce a preconditioning of the ADMM algorithm,\nwhich mathematically justifies the use of such an adjustable denoiser. We\nadditionally propose a procedure for training a convolutional neural network\nfor high quality non-blind image denoising that also allows for pixel-wise\ncontrol of the noise standard deviation. We show that our pixel-wise adjustable\ndenoiser, along with a suitable preconditioning strategy, can further improve\nthe plug-and-play ADMM approach for several applications, including image\ncompletion, interpolation, demosaicing and Poisson denoising.",

This due to the availability of\ncustomizing ordering experiences, easy payment methods, fast delivery, and\nothers. The competition between online food delivery providers has intensified\nto attain a wider range of customers. Hence, they should have a better\nunderstanding of their customers' needs and predict their purchasing decisions.\nMachine learning has a significant impact on companies' bottom line. They are\nused to construct models and strategies in industries that rely on big data and\nneed a system to evaluate it fast and effectively. Predictive modeling is a\ntype of machine learning that uses various regression algorithms, analytics,\nand statistics to estimate the probability of an occurrence. The incorporation\nof predictive models helps online food delivery providers to understand their\ncustomers. In this study, a dataset collected from 388 consumers in Bangalore,\nIndia was provided to predict their purchasing decisions. Four prediction\nmodels are considered: CART and C4.5 decision trees, random forest, and\nrule-based classifiers, and their accuracies in providing the correct class\nlabel are evaluated. The findings show that all models perform similarly, but\nthe C4.5 outperforms them all with an accuracy of 91.67%.",

    "abstract": "The optic disc is a crucial diagnostic feature in the eye since changes to\nits physiognomy is correlated with the severity of various ocular and\ncardiovascular diseases. While identifying the bulk of the optic disc in a\ncolor fundus image is straightforward, accurately segmenting its boundary at\nthe pixel level is very challenging. In this work, we propose disc-centered\npatch augmentation (DCPA) -- a simple, yet novel training scheme for deep\nneural networks -- to address this problem. DCPA achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on full-size images even when using small neural networks, specifically\na U-Net with only 7 million parameters as opposed to the original 31 million.\nIn DCPA, we restrict the training data to patches that fully contain the optic\nnerve. In addition, we also train the network using dynamic cost functions to\nincrease its robustness. We tested DCPA-trained networks on five retinal\ndatasets: DRISTI, DRIONS-DB, DRIVE, AV-WIDE, and CHASE-DB. The first two had\navailable optic disc ground truth, and we manually estimated the ground truth\nfor the latter three. Our approach achieved state-of-the-art F1 and IOU results\non four datasets (95 % F1, 91 % IOU on DRISTI; 92 % F1, 84 % IOU on DRIVE; 83 %\nF1, 71 % IOU on AV-WIDE; 83 % F1, 71 % IOU on CHASEDB) and competitive results\non the fifth (95 % F1, 91 % IOU on DRIONS-DB), confirming its generality.

    "abstract": "Distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) extends the value-based approach\nby using a deep convolutional network to approximate the full distribution over\nfuture returns instead of the mean only, providing a richer signal that leads\nto improved performances. Quantile-based methods like QR-DQN project arbitrary\ndistributions onto a parametric subset of staircase distributions by minimizing\nthe 1-Wasserstein distance, however, due to biases in the gradients, the\nquantile regression loss is used instead for training, guaranteeing the same\nminimizer and enjoying unbiased gradients. Recently, monotonicity constraints\non the quantiles have been shown to improve the performance of QR-DQN for\nuncertainty-based exploration strategies. The contribution of this work is in\nthe setting of fixed quantile levels and is twofold. First, we prove that the\nCram\\'er distance yields a projection that coincides with the 1-Wasserstein one\nand that, under monotonicity constraints, the squared Cram\\'er and the quantile\nregression losses yield collinear gradients, shedding light on the connection\nbetween these important elements of DRL. Second, we propose a novel\nnon-crossing neural architecture that allows a good training performance using\na novel algorithm to compute the Cram\\'er distance, yielding significant\nimprovements over QR-DQN in a number of games of the standard Atari 2600\nbenchmark.",

    "abstract": "Models used for many important engineering and natural systems are imperfect.\nThe discrepancy between the mathematical representations of a true physical\nsystem and its imperfect model is called the model error. These model errors\ncan lead to substantial difference between the numerical solutions of the model\nand the observations of the system, particularly in those involving nonlinear,\nmulti-scale phenomena. Thus, there is substantial interest in reducing model\nerrors, particularly through understanding their physics and sources and\nleveraging the rapid growth of observational data. Here we introduce a\nframework named MEDIDA: Model Error Discovery with Interpretability and Data\nAssimilation. MEDIDA only requires a working numerical solver of the model and\na small number of noise-free or noisy sporadic observations of the system. In\nMEDIDA, first the model error is estimated from differences between the\nobserved states and model-predicted states (the latter are obtained from a\nnumber of one-time-step numerical integrations from the previous observed\nstates). If observations are noisy, a data assimilation (DA) technique such as\nensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is first used to provide a noise-free analysis\nstate of the system, which is then used in estimating the model error. Finally,\nan equation-discovery technique, such as the relevance vector machine (RVM), a\nsparsity-promoting Bayesian method, is used to identify an interpretable,\nparsimonious, closed-form representation of the model error. Using the chaotic\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system as the test case, we demonstrate the excellent\nperformance of MEDIDA in discovering different types of structural/parametric\nmodel errors, representing different types of missing physics, using noise-free\nand noisy observations.",

    "title": "Weight Vector Tuning and Asymptotic Analysis of Binary Linear  Classifiers",
    "abstract": "Unlike its intercept, a linear classifier's weight vector cannot be tuned by\na simple grid search. Hence, this paper proposes weight vector tuning of a\ngeneric binary linear classifier through the parameterization of a\ndecomposition of the discriminant by a scalar which controls the trade-off\nbetween conflicting informative and noisy terms. By varying this parameter, the\noriginal weight vector is modified in a meaningful way. Applying this method to\na number of linear classifiers under a variety of data dimensionality and\nsample size settings reveals that the classification performance loss due to\nnon-optimal native hyperparameters can be compensated for by weight vector\ntuning. This yields computational savings as the proposed tuning method reduces\nto tuning a scalar compared to tuning the native hyperparameter, which may\ninvolve repeated weight vector generation along with its burden of\noptimization, dimensionality reduction, etc., depending on the classifier. It\nis also found that weight vector tuning significantly improves the performance\nof Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) under high estimation noise. Proceeding\nfrom this second finding, an asymptotic study of the misclassification\nprobability of the parameterized LDA classifier in the growth regime where the\ndata dimensionality and sample size are comparable is conducted. Using random\nmatrix theory, the misclassification probability is shown to converge to a\nquantity that is a function of the true statistics of the data. Additionally,\nan estimator of the misclassification probability is derived. Finally,\ncomputationally efficient tuning of the parameter using this estimator is\ndemonstrated on real data.",
