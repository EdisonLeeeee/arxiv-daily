    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the optimized Schwarz waveform relaxation method\nand Ventcel transmission conditions for the linear advection-diffusion\nequation. A mixed formulation is considered in which the flux variable\nrepresents both diffusive and advective flux, and Lagrange multipliers are\nintroduced on the interfaces between nonoverlapping subdomains to handle\ntangential derivatives in the Ventcel conditions. A space-time interface\nproblem is formulated and is solved iteratively. Each iteration involves the\nsolution of time-dependent problems with Ventcel boundary conditions in the\nsubdomains. The subdomain problems are discretized in space by a mixed hybrid\nfinite element method based on the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas space and in\ntime by the backward Euler method. The proposed algorithm is fully implicit and\nenables different time steps in the subdomains. Numerical results with\ndiscontinuous coefficients and various Pecl\\'et numbers validate the accuracy\nof the method with nonconforming time grids and confirm the improved\nconvergence properties of Ventcel conditions over Robin conditions.",

    "abstract": "Current trends in the computer graphics community propose leveraging the\nmassive parallel computational power of GPUs to accelerate physically based\nsimulations. Collision detection and solving is a fundamental part of this\nprocess. It is also the most significant bottleneck on physically based\nsimulations and it easily becomes intractable as the number of vertices in the\nscene increases. Brute force approaches carry a quadratic growth in both\ncomputational time and memory footprint. While their parallelization is trivial\nin GPUs, their complexity discourages from using such approaches. Acceleration\nstructures -- such as BVH -- are often applied to increase performance,\nachieving logarithmic computational times for individual point queries.\nNonetheless, their memory footprint also grows rapidly and their\nparallelization in a GPU is problematic due to their branching nature. We\npropose using implicit surface representations learnt through deep learning for\ncollision handling in physically based simulations. Our proposed architecture\nhas a complexity of O(n) -- or O(1) for a single point query -- and has no\nparallelization issues. We will show how this permits accurate and efficient\ncollision handling in physically based simulations, more specifically, for\ncloth. In our experiments, we query up to 1M points in 300 milliseconds.",

However, advances in deep generative\nmodels have also led to the generation of very realistic fake content, also\nknown as deepfakes, causing a threat to privacy, democracy, and national\nsecurity. Most of the current deepfake detection methods are deemed as a binary\nclassification problem in distinguishing authentic images or videos from fake\nones using two-class convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These methods are\nbased on detecting visual artifacts, temporal or color inconsistencies produced\nby deep generative models. However, these methods require a large amount of\nreal and fake data for model training and their performance drops significantly\nin cross dataset evaluation with samples generated using advanced deepfake\ngeneration techniques. In this paper, we thoroughly evaluate the efficacy of\ndeep face recognition in identifying deepfakes, using different loss functions\nand deepfake generation techniques. Experimental investigations on challenging\nCeleb-DF and FaceForensics++ deepfake datasets suggest the efficacy of deep\nface recognition in identifying deepfakes over two-class CNNs and the ocular\nmodality.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to track the designated\nobjects present in the initial frame of a video at the pixel level. To fully\nexploit the appearance information of an object, pixel-level feature matching\nis widely used in VOS. Conventional feature matching runs in a surjective\nmanner, i.e., only the best matches from the query frame to the reference frame\nare considered. Each location in the query frame refers to the optimal location\nin the reference frame regardless of how often each reference frame location is\nreferenced. This works well in most cases and is robust against rapid\nappearance variations, but may cause critical errors when the query frame\ncontains background distractors that look similar to the target object. To\nmitigate this concern, we introduce a bijective matching mechanism to find the\nbest matches from the query frame to the reference frame and vice versa. Before\nfinding the best matches for the query frame pixels, the optimal matches for\nthe reference frame pixels are first considered to prevent each reference frame\npixel from being overly referenced. As this mechanism operates in a strict\nmanner, i.e., pixels are connected if and only if they are the sure matches for\neach other, it can effectively eliminate background distractors. In addition,\nwe propose a mask embedding module to improve the existing mask propagation\nmethod. By embedding multiple historic masks with coordinate information, it\ncan effectively capture the position information of a target object.",

The standard\napproaches to prevent overfitting are dimensionality reduction and\nregularization. But dimensionality reduction loses information, while\nregularization requires the user to choose a norm, or a prior, or a distance\nmetric. We propose an algorithm called RoLin that needs no user choice and\napplies to a large class of loss functions. RoLin combines reliable information\nfrom the top principal components with a robust optimization to extract any\nuseful information from unreliable subspaces. It also includes a new robust\ncross-validation that is better than existing cross-validation methods in the\nlimited-data setting. Experiments on $25$ real-world datasets and three\nstandard loss functions show that RoLin broadly outperforms both dimensionality\nreduction and regularization. Dimensionality reduction has $14\\%-40\\%$ worse\ntest loss on average as compared to RoLin. Against $L_1$ and $L_2$\nregularization, RoLin can be up to 3x better for logistic loss and 12x better\nfor squared hinge loss. The differences are greatest for small sample sizes,\nwhere RoLin achieves the best loss on 2x to 3x more datasets than any competing\nmethod.

    "abstract": "Iterating with new and improved OCR solutions enforces decisions to be taken\nwhen it comes to targeting the right reprocessing candidates. This especially\napplies when the underlying data collection is of considerable size and rather\ndiverse in terms of fonts, languages, periods of publication and consequently\nOCR quality. This article captures the efforts of the National Library of\nLuxembourg to support those exact decisions. They are crucial in order to\nguarantee low computational overhead and reduced quality degradation risks,\ncombined with a more quantifiable OCR improvement. In particular, this work\nexplains the methodology of the library with respect to text block level\nquality assessment. As an extension of this technique, another contribution\ncomes in the form of a regression model that takes the enhancement potential of\na new OCR engine into account. They both mark promising approaches, especially\nfor cultural institutions dealing with historic data of lower quality.",

    "abstract": "In machine learning, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is widely deployed to\ntrain models using highly non-convex objectives with equally complex noise\nmodels. Unfortunately, SGD theory often makes restrictive assumptions that fail\nto capture the non-convexity of real problems, and almost entirely ignore the\ncomplex noise models that exist in practice. In this work, we make substantial\nprogress on this shortcoming. First, we establish that SGD's iterates will\neither globally converge to a stationary point or diverge under nearly\narbitrary nonconvexity and noise models. Under a slightly more restrictive\nassumption on the joint behavior of the non-convexity and noise model that\ngeneralizes current assumptions in the literature, we show that the objective\nfunction cannot diverge, even if the iterates diverge. As a consequence of our\nresults, SGD can be applied to a greater range of stochastic optimization\nproblems with confidence about its global convergence behavior and stability.",

    "abstract": "With the increase of order fulfillment options and business objectives taken\ninto consideration in the deciding process, order fulfillment deciding is\nbecoming more and more complex. For example, with the advent of ship from store\nretailers now have many more fulfillment nodes to consider, and it is now\ncommon to take into account many and varied business goals in making\nfulfillment decisions. With increasing complexity, efficiency of the deciding\nprocess can become a real concern.

In this work, we explore the possibility of exploiting\nregularity in the fulfillment decision process to reduce the burden on the\ndeciding system. By using data mining we aim to find patterns in past\nfulfillment decisions that can be used to efficiently predict most likely\nassignments for future decisions.

A typical approach\nis to train a classifier in a supervised manner using data labeled by humans.\nThis approach has limitations due to the expensive annotation cost and the\nclosed coverage of activity labels. A potential way to address these\nlimitations is to use self-supervised learning (SSL). Instead of relying on\nhuman annotations, SSL leverages intrinsic properties of data to learn\nrepresentations. We are particularly interested in learning egocentric video\nrepresentations benefiting from the head-motion generated by users' daily\nactivities, which can be easily obtained from IMU sensors embedded in AR/VR\ndevices.

    "abstract": "A ubiquitous learning problem in today's digital market is, during repeated\ninteractions between a seller and a buyer, how a seller can gradually learn\noptimal pricing decisions based on the buyer's past purchase responses. A\nfundamental challenge of learning in such a strategic setup is that the buyer\nwill naturally have incentives to manipulate his responses in order to induce\nmore favorable learning outcomes for him. To understand the limits of the\nseller's learning when facing such a strategic and possibly manipulative buyer,\nwe study a natural yet powerful buyer manipulation strategy. That is, before\nthe pricing game starts, the buyer simply commits to \"imitate\" a different\nvalue function by pretending to always react optimally according to this\nimitative value function.\nWe fully characterize the optimal imitative value function that the buyer\nshould imitate as well as the resultant seller revenue and buyer surplus under\nthis optimal buyer manipulation. Our characterizations reveal many useful\ninsights about what happens at equilibrium. For example, a seller with concave\nproduction cost will obtain essentially 0 revenue at equilibrium whereas the\nrevenue for a seller with convex production cost is the Bregman divergence of\nher cost function between no production and certain production. Finally, and\nimportantly, we show that a more powerful class of pricing schemes does not\nnecessarily increase, in fact, may be harmful to, the seller's revenue. Our\nresults not only lead to an effective prescriptive way for buyers to manipulate\nlearning algorithms but also shed lights on the limits of what a seller can\nreally achieve when pricing in the dark.",

    "abstract": "Many modern workloads such as neural network inference and graph processing\nare fundamentally memory-bound. For such workloads, data movement between\nmemory and CPU cores imposes a significant overhead in terms of both latency\nand energy. A major reason is that this communication happens through a narrow\nbus with high latency and limited bandwidth, and the low data reuse in\nmemory-bound workloads is insufficient to amortize the cost of memory access.\nFundamentally addressing this data movement bottleneck requires a paradigm\nwhere the memory system assumes an active role in computing by integrating\nprocessing capabilities. This paradigm is known as processing-in-memory (PIM).\nRecent research explores different forms of PIM architectures, motivated by the\nemergence of new technologies that integrate memory with a logic layer, where\nprocessing elements can be easily placed. Past works evaluate these\narchitectures in simulation or, at best, with simplified hardware prototypes.\nIn contrast, the UPMEM company has designed and manufactured the first\npublicly-available real-world PIM architecture. The UPMEM PIM architecture\ncombines traditional DRAM memory arrays with general-purpose in-order cores,\ncalled DRAM Processing Units (DPUs), integrated in the same chip. This paper\npresents key takeaways from the first comprehensive analysis of the first\npublicly-available real-world PIM architecture. We provide four key takeaways\nabout the UPMEM PIM architecture, which stem from our study.

LazySets is the core library of JuliaReach, a cutting-edge software\naddressing the fundamental problem of reachability analysis: computing the set\nof states that are reachable by a dynamical system from all initial states and\nfor all admissible inputs and parameters. While the library was originally\ndesigned for reachability and formal verification, its scope goes beyond such\ntopics.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks are emerging as promising methods for modeling\nmolecular graphs, in which nodes and edges correspond to atoms and chemical\nbonds, respectively. Recent studies show that when 3D molecular geometries,\nsuch as bond lengths and angles, are available, molecular property prediction\ntasks can be made more accurate. However, computing of 3D molecular geometries\nrequires quantum calculations that are computationally prohibitive. For\nexample, accurate calculation of 3D geometries of a small molecule requires\nhours of computing time using density functional theory (DFT). Here, we propose\nto predict the ground-state 3D geometries from molecular graphs using machine\nlearning methods. To make this feasible, we develop a benchmark, known as\nMolecule3D, that includes a dataset with precise ground-state geometries of\napproximately 4 million molecules derived from DFT. We also provide a set of\nsoftware tools for data processing, splitting, training, and evaluation, etc.\nSpecifically, we propose to assess the error and validity of predicted\ngeometries using four metrics. We implement two baseline methods that either\npredict the pairwise distance between atoms or atom coordinates in 3D space.\nExperimental results show that, compared with generating 3D geometries with\nRDKit, our method can achieve comparable prediction accuracy but with much\nsmaller computational costs.

    "abstract": "Naturalistic driving data (NDD) can help understand drivers' reactions to\neach driving scenario and provide personalized context to driving behavior.\nHowever, NDD requires a high amount of manual labor to label certain driver's\nstate and behavioral patterns. Unsupervised analysis of NDD can be used to\nautomatically detect different patterns from the driver and vehicle data. In\nthis paper, we propose a methodology to understand changes in driver's\nphysiological responses within different driving patterns. Our methodology\nfirst decomposes a driving scenario by using a Bayesian Change Point detection\nmodel. We then apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation method on both driver\nstate and behavior data to detect patterns. We present two case studies in\nwhich vehicles were equipped to collect exterior, interior, and driver\nbehavioral data. Four patterns of driving behaviors (i.e., harsh brake, normal\nbrake, curved driving, and highway driving), as well as two patterns of\ndriver's heart rate (HR) (i.e., normal vs. abnormal high HR), and gaze entropy\n(i.e., low versus high), were detected in these two case studies. The findings\nof these case studies indicated that among our participants, the drivers' HR\nhad a higher fraction of abnormal patterns during harsh brakes, accelerating\nand curved driving. Additionally, free-flow driving with close to zero\naccelerations on the highway was accompanied by more fraction of normal HR as\nwell as a lower gaze entropy pattern. With the proposed methodology we can\nbetter understand variations in driver's psychophysiological states within\ndifferent driving scenarios.

    "abstract": "Although research studies in pneumatic soft robots develop rapidly, most\npneumatic actuators are still controlled by rigid valves and conventional\nelectronics. The existence of these rigid, electronic components sacrifices the\ncompliance and adaptability of soft robots.} Current electronics-free valve\ndesigns based on soft materials are facing challenges in behaviour consistency,\ndesign flexibility, and fabrication complexity. Taking advantages of soft\nmaterial 3D printing, this paper presents a new design of a bi-stable pneumatic\nvalve, which utilises two soft, pneumatically-driven, and\nsymmetrically-oriented conical shells with structural bistability to stabilise\nand regulate the airflow. The critical pressure required to operate the valve\ncan be adjusted by changing the design features of the soft bi-stable\nstructure. Multi-material printing simplifies the valve fabrication, enhances\nthe flexibility in design feature optimisations, and improves the system\nrepeatability. In this work, both a theoretical model and physical experiments\nare introduced to examine the relationships between the critical operating\npressure and the key design features. Results with valve characteristic tuning\nvia material stiffness changing show better effectiveness compared to the\nchange of geometry design features (demonstrated largest tunable critical\npressure range from 15.3 to 65.2 kPa and fastest response time $\\leq$ 1.8 s.",

Prior research studying the\neffects of online reviews has been mainly focused on a single numerical cause,\ne.g., ratings or sentiment scores. We argue that such notions of causes entail\nthree key limitations: they solely consider the effects of single numerical\ncauses and ignore different effects of multiple aspects -- e.g., Food, Service\n-- embedded in the textual reviews; they assume the absence of hidden\nconfounders in observational studies, e.g., consumers' personal preferences;\nand they overlook the indirect effects of numerical causes that can potentially\ncancel out the effect of textual reviews on business revenue. We thereby\npropose an alternative perspective to this single-cause-based effect estimation\nof online reviews: in the presence of hidden confounders, we consider\nmulti-aspect textual reviews, particularly, their total effects on business\nrevenue and direct effects with the numerical cause -- ratings -- being the\nmediator. We draw on recent advances in machine learning and causal inference\nto together estimate the hidden confounders and causal effects.

In this paper, we present the design and\ndevelopment of a mobile, image-based dietary assessment system to capture and\nanalyze dietary intake, which has been deployed in both controlled-feeding and\ncommunity-dwelling dietary studies. Our system is capable of collecting high\nquality food images in naturalistic settings and provides groundtruth\nannotations for developing new computational approaches.",

A stand-alone validation set (not\nused to train the base classifier) is preferred for posterior estimation to\navoid overfitting the base classifier, however a small validation set limits\nthe number of features one can effectively use. We propose a simple, yet\nrobust, logit vector compression approach based on generalized logits and label\nconfusions for the task of label posterior estimation within the context of\nhierarchical classification.

However, the input to a\nrelational operator may be complex in machine learning pipelines, and may\ninvolve various combinations of matrix operators. Hence, it is critical to\nrealize scalable and efficient relational query processors that directly\noperate on big matrix data.

Furthermore, optimized partitioning\nschemes for the input matrices are developed to facilitate the performance of\njoin operations based on a cost model that minimizes the communication\noverhead.The proposed relational query processing techniques are prototyped in\nApache Spark.

    "abstract": "Automotive radar has been widely used in the modern advanced driver\nassistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving system as it provides reliable\nenvironmental perception in all-weather conditions with affordable cost.\nHowever, automotive radar usually only plays as an auxiliary sensor since it\nhardly supplies semantic and geometry information due to the sparsity of radar\ndetection points. Nonetheless, as development of high-resolution automotive\nradar in recent years, more advanced perception functionality like instance\nsegmentation which has only been well explored using Lidar point clouds,\nbecomes possible by using automotive radar. Its data comes with rich contexts\nsuch as Radar Cross Section (RCS) and micro-doppler effects which may\npotentially be pertinent, and sometimes can even provide detection when the\nfield of view is completely obscured. Therefore, the effective utilization of\nradar detection points data is an integral part of automotive perception. The\noutcome from instance segmentation could be seen as comparable result of\nclustering, and could be potentially used as the input of tracker for tracking\nthe targets. In this paper, we propose two efficient methods for instance\nsegmentation with radar detection points, one is implemented in an end-to-end\ndeep learning driven fashion using PointNet++ framework, and the other is based\non clustering of the radar detection points with semantic information. Both\napproaches can be further improved by implementing visual multi-layer\nperceptron (MLP).

The\ninformation schism between the real-world and that which can be gathered and\nconsidered by any individual information processing agent is characterized and\ndiscussed, which is followed by the presentation of a series of the adopted\nrequisites while developing the modeling approach. The issue of mapping from\ndatasets into models is subsequently addressed, as well as some of the\nrespectively implied difficulties and limitations. Based on these\nconsiderations, an approach to meta modeling how models are built is then\nprogressively developed. First, the reference M^* meta model framework is\npresented, which relies critically in associating whole datasets and respective\nmodels in terms of a strict equivalence relation. Among the interesting\nfeatures of this model are its ability to bridge the gap between data and\nmodeling, as well as paving the way to an algebra of both data and models which\ncan be employed to combine models into hierarchical manner.

While recent work in spatiotemporal prediction has\nleveraged deep sequential models that substantially improve over classical\napproaches, these models are prone to overfitting when the observation is\nextremely sparse, as in the task of crime event prediction. To overcome these\nsparsity issues, we present Multi-axis Attentive Prediction for Sparse Event\nData (MAPSED). We propose a purely attentional approach to extract both\nshort-term dynamics and long-term semantics of event propagation through two\nobservation angles. Unlike existing temporal prediction models that propagate\nlatent information primarily along the temporal dimension, the MAPSED\nsimultaneously operates over all axes (time, 2D space, event type) of the\nembedded data tensor. We additionally introduce a novel Frobenius norm-based\ncontrastive learning objective to improve latent representational\ngeneralization.Empirically, we validate MAPSED on two publicly accessible urban\ncrime datasets for spatiotemporal sparse event prediction, where MAPSED\noutperforms both classical and state-of-the-art deep learning models. The\nproposed contrastive learning objective significantly enhances the MAPSED's\nability to capture the semantics and dynamics of the events, resulting in\nbetter generalization ability to combat sparse observations.",

    "title": "Enabling Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems with Wireless Millimeter Wave  Fronthaul",
    "abstract": "Cell-free massive MIMO systems have promising data rate and uniform coverage\ngains. These systems, however, typically rely on optical fiber based fronthaul\nfor the communication between the central processing unit (CPU) and the\ndistributed access points (APs), which increases the infrastructure cost, leads\nto high installation time, and limits the deployment flexibility and\nadaptability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two\narchitectures for cell-free massive MIMO systems based on wireless fronthaul\nthat is operating at a \\textit{higher-band} compared to the access links: (i) A\nwireless-only fronthaul architecture where the CPU has a wireless fronthaul\nlink to each AP, and (ii) a mixed-fronthaul architecture where the CPU has a\nwireless link to each cluster of APs that are connected together via optical\nfibers. These dual-band architectures ensure high-data rate fronthaul and\nprovide high capability to synchronize the distributed APs. Further, the\nwireless fronthaul reduces the infrastructure cost and installation time, and\nenhances the flexibility, adaptability, and scalability of the network\ndeployment. To investigate the achievable data rates with the proposed\narchitectures, we formulate the end-to-end data rate optimization problem\naccounting for the various practical aspects of the fronthaul and access links.\nThen, we develop a low-complexity yet efficient joint beamforming and resource\nallocation solution for the proposed architectures based on user-centric AP\ngrouping. With this solution, we show that the proposed architectures can\nachieve comparable data rates to those obtained with optical fiber-based\nfronthaul under realistic assumptions on the fronthaul bandwidth, hardware\nconstraints, and deployment scenarios. This highlights a promising path for\nrealizing the cell-free massive MIMO gains in practice while reducing the\ninfrastructure and deployment overhead.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is critical in various fields, including intrusion\ndetection, health monitoring, fault diagnosis, and sensor network event\ndetection. The isolation forest (or iForest) approach is a well-known technique\nfor detecting anomalies. It is, however, ineffective when dealing with dynamic\nstreaming data, which is becoming increasingly prevalent in a wide variety of\napplication areas these days. In this work, we extend our previous work by\nproposed an efficient iForest based approach for anomaly detection using cube\nsampling that is effective on streaming data. Cube sampling is used in the\ninitial stage to choose nearly balanced samples, significantly reducing storage\nrequirements while preserving efficiency. Following that, the streaming nature\nof data is addressed by a sliding window technique that generates consecutive\nchunks of data for systematic processing. The novelty of this paper is in\napplying Cube sampling in iForest and calculating inclusion probability. The\nproposed approach is equally successful at detecting anomalies as existing\nstate-of-the-art approaches, requiring significantly less storage and time\ncomplexity. We undertake empirical evaluations of the proposed approach using\nstandard datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms traditional approaches in\nterms of Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) and can handle high-dimensional\nstreaming data.",

Query-efficient\nblack-box attacks rely on effectively estimated gradients towards maximizing\nthe probability of misclassifying the target video. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that such effective gradients can be searched for by parameterizing\nthe temporal structure of the search space with geometric transformations.\nSpecifically, we design a novel iterative algorithm Geometric TRAnsformed\nPerturbations (GEO-TRAP), for attacking video classification models. GEO-TRAP\nemploys standard geometric transformation operations to reduce the search space\nfor effective gradients into searching for a small group of parameters that\ndefine these operations. This group of parameters describes the geometric\nprogression of gradients, resulting in a reduced and structured search space.\nOur algorithm inherently leads to successful perturbations with surprisingly\nfew queries. For example, adversarial examples generated from GEO-TRAP have\nbetter attack success rates with ~73.55% fewer queries compared to the\nstate-of-the-art method for video adversarial attacks on the widely used Jester\ndataset.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has shown its effectiveness in various\napplications and provides a promising direction for solving tasks with high\ncomplexity. In most reinforcement learning algorithms, however, two major\nissues need to be dealt with - the sample inefficiency and the interpretability\nof a policy. The former happens when the environment is sparsely rewarded\nand/or has a long-term credit assignment problem, while the latter becomes a\nproblem when the learned policies are deployed at the customer side product. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm\nthat mitigates the aforementioned issues by decomposing the original task in a\nhierarchy and by compounding pretrained primitives with intents. We show how\nthe proposed scheme can be employed in practice by solving a pick and place\ntask with a 6 DoF manipulator.",

    "abstract": "AI systems have seen dramatic advancement in recent years, bringing many\napplications that pervade our everyday life. However, we are still mostly\nseeing instances of narrow AI: many of these recent developments are typically\nfocused on a very limited set of competencies and goals, e.g., image\ninterpretation, natural language processing, classification, prediction, and\nmany others. Moreover, while these successes can be accredited to improved\nalgorithms and techniques, they are also tightly linked to the availability of\nhuge datasets and computational power. State-of-the-art AI still lacks many\ncapabilities that would naturally be included in a notion of (human)\nintelligence.\nWe argue that a better study of the mechanisms that allow humans to have\nthese capabilities can help us understand how to imbue AI systems with these\ncompetencies. We focus especially on D. Kahneman's theory of thinking fast and\nslow, and we propose a multi-agent AI architecture where incoming problems are\nsolved by either system 1 (or \"fast\") agents, that react by exploiting only\npast experience, or by system 2 (or \"slow\") agents, that are deliberately\nactivated when there is the need to reason and search for optimal solutions\nbeyond what is expected from the system 1 agent. Both kinds of agents are\nsupported by a model of the world, containing domain knowledge about the\nenvironment, and a model of \"self\", containing information about past actions\nof the system and solvers' skills.",

The latter suggests that to infer what someone\nmeans, an agent constructs a rationale for the observed behaviour of others.\nCommunication then requires two agents labour under similar compulsions and\nhave similar experiences (construct similar solutions to similar tasks). Any\nnon-human intelligence may construct solutions such that any rationale for\ntheir behaviour (and thus the meaning of their signals) is outside the scope of\nwhat a human is inclined to notice or comprehend. Further, the more compressed\na signal, the closer it will appear to random noise. Another intelligence may\npossess the ability to compress information to the extent that, to us, their\nsignals would appear indistinguishable from noise (an explanation for The Fermi\nParadox). To facilitate predictive accuracy an AGI would tend to more\ncompressed representations of the world, making any rationale for their\nbehaviour more difficult to comprehend for the same reason.

A model for this task should be able to\nextract high-level patterns such as presence of a peak or a dip. While typical\ncontemporary neural models with attention mechanisms can generate fluent output\ndescriptions for this task, they often generate factually incorrect\ndescriptions. We propose a computational model with a truth-conditional\narchitecture which first runs small learned programs on the input time series,\nthen identifies the programs/patterns which hold true for the given input, and\nfinally conditions on only the chosen valid program (rather than the input time\nseries) to generate the output text description. A program in our model is\nconstructed from modules, which are small neural networks that are designed to\ncapture numerical patterns and temporal information. The modules are shared\nacross multiple programs, enabling compositionality as well as efficient\nlearning of module parameters. The modules, as well as the composition of the\nmodules, are unobserved in data, and we learn them in an end-to-end fashion\nwith the only training signal coming from the accompanying natural language\ntext descriptions.

Short-term\npredictions of these events rely on forecasts from numerical weather models, in\nwhich, despite much improvement in the past decades, outstanding issues remain\nconcerning model uncertainties, and increasing demands for computation and\nstorage resources. In recent years, the advance of deep learning offers a\nviable alternative approach. Here, we show that a 3D convolutional neural\nnetwork using a single frame of meteorology fields as input is capable of\npredicting the precipitation spatial distribution. The network is developed\nbased on 39-years (1980-2018) data of meteorology and daily precipitation over\nthe contiguous United States. The results bring fundamental advancements in\nweather prediction. First, the trained network alone outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art weather models in predicting daily total precipitation, and\nthe superiority of the network extends to forecast leads up to 5 days. Second,\ncombining the network predictions with the weather-model forecasts\nsignificantly improves the accuracy of model forecasts, especially for\nheavy-precipitation events. Third, the millisecond-scale inference time of the\nnetwork facilitates large ensemble predictions for further accuracy\nimprovement.

Much of the\nwork thus far in continual learning focuses on supervised learning and some\nrecent works on unsupervised learning. In many domains, each task contains a\nmix of labelled (typically very few) and unlabelled (typically plenty) training\nexamples, which necessitates a semi-supervised learning approach. To address\nthis in a continual learning setting, we propose a framework for\nsemi-supervised continual learning called Meta-Consolidation for Continual\nSemi-Supervised Learning (MCSSL). Our framework has a hypernetwork that learns\nthe meta-distribution that generates the weights of a semi-supervised auxiliary\nclassifier generative adversarial network $(\\textit{Semi-ACGAN})$ as the base\nnetwork. We consolidate the knowledge of sequential tasks in the hypernetwork,\nand the base network learns the semi-supervised learning task. Further, we\npresent $\\textit{Semi-Split CIFAR-10}$, a new benchmark for continual\nsemi-supervised learning, obtained by modifying the $\\textit{Split CIFAR-10}$\ndataset, in which the tasks with labelled and unlabelled data arrive\nsequentially.

However, LMs are usually trained to maximize the likelihood of correct\nword sequences, not to detect ASR errors. We propose an ASR rescoring method\nfor directly detecting errors with ELECTRA, which is originally a pre-training\nmethod for NLP tasks. ELECTRA is pre-trained to predict whether each word is\nreplaced by BERT or not, which can simulate ASR error detection on large text\ncorpora. To make this pre-training closer to ASR error detection, we further\npropose an extended version of ELECTRA called phone-attentive ELECTRA\n(P-ELECTRA). In the pre-training of P-ELECTRA, each word is replaced by a\nphone-to-word conversion model, which leverages phone information to generate\nacoustically similar words. Since our rescoring method is optimized for\ndetecting errors, it can also be used for word-level confidence estimation.\nExperimental evaluations on the Librispeech and TED-LIUM2 corpora show that our\nrescoring method with ELECTRA is competitive with conventional rescoring\nmethods with faster inference.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has been widely used within learning algorithms for robotics.\nOne disadvantage of deep networks is that these networks are black-box\nrepresentations. Therefore, the learned approximations ignore the existing\nknowledge of physics or robotics. Especially for learning dynamics models,\nthese black-box models are not desirable as the underlying principles are well\nunderstood and the standard deep networks can learn dynamics that violate these\nprinciples. To learn dynamics models with deep networks that guarantee\nphysically plausible dynamics, we introduce physics-inspired deep networks that\ncombine first principles from physics with deep learning. We incorporate\nLagrangian mechanics within the model learning such that all approximated\nmodels adhere to the laws of physics and conserve energy. Deep Lagrangian\nNetworks (DeLaN) parametrize the system energy using two networks. The\nparameters are obtained by minimizing the squared residual of the\nEuler-Lagrange differential equation. Therefore, the resulting model does not\nrequire specific knowledge of the individual system, is interpretable, and can\nbe used as a forward, inverse, and energy model. Previously these properties\nwere only obtained when using system identification techniques that require\nknowledge of the kinematic structure. We apply DeLaN to learning dynamics\nmodels and apply these models to control simulated and physical rigid body\nsystems. The results show that the proposed approach obtains dynamics models\nthat can be applied to physical systems for real-time control.

While\nareas within the urban space (metropolitan mobile space) are being developed,\nrural areas are left behind. Due to challenges of low population density, low\nincome, difficult terrain, non-existent infrastructure, lack of power grid,\nremote areas have low digital penetration. This situation makes remote areas\nless attractive towards investments and to operate connectivity networks, thus\nfailing to achieve universal access to the Internet. In addressing this issue,\nthis paper proposes a new BS deployment and resource management method for\nremote and rural areas. Here, two MN operators share their resources towards\nthe procurement and deployment of green energy-powered BSs equipped with\ncomputing capabilities. Then, the network infrastructure is shared between the\nmobile operators, with the main goal of enabling energy-efficient\ninfrastructure sharing, i.e., BS and its co-located computing platform. Using\nthis resource management strategy in rural communication sites guarantees a\nQuality of Service (QoS) comparable to that of urban communication sites. The\nperformance evaluation conducted through simulations validates our analysis as\nthe prediction variations observed shows greater accuracy between the harvested\nenergy and the traffic load. Also, the energy savings decrease as the number of\nmobile users (50 users in our case) connected to the remote site increases.\nLastly, the proposed algorithm achieves 51% energy savings when compared with\nthe 43% obtained by our benchmark algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates\nsuperior performance over the benchmark algorithm as it uses foresighted\noptimization where the harvested energy and the expected load are predicted\nover a given short-term horizon.",

    "title": "Towards optimal quality requirement documentation in agile software  development: a multiple case study",
    "abstract": "Context-Agile software development (ASD) promotes minimal documentation and\noften prioritizes functional requirements over quality requirements (QRs). The\nminimal documentation emphasis may be beneficial in reducing time-to-market for\nsoftware. However, it can also be a concern, especially with QRs, since they\nare challenging to specify and document and are crucial for software success.\nTherefore, understanding how practitioners perceive the importance of QR\ndocumentation is valuable because it can provide insight into how they approach\nthis task. It also helps in developing models and guidelines that support the\ndocumentation of QRs in ASD, which is a research gap. Objective: We aim to\nunderstand practitioners' perceptions of QR documentation and factors\ninfluencing this task to derive a model that supports optimal QR documentation\nin ASD. Method: We conducted a multiple case study involving 12 participants\nfrom three cases that apply ASD. Please refer to the document to read the full\nversion of the abstract.",

    "abstract": "Ego networks have proved to be a valuable tool for understanding the\nrelationships that individuals establish with their peers, both in offline and\nonline social networks. Particularly interesting are the cognitive constraints\nassociated with the interactions between the ego and the members of their ego\nnetwork, which limit individuals to maintain meaningful interactions with no\nmore than 150 people, on average, and to arrange such relationships along\nconcentric circles of decreasing engagement. In this work, we focus on the ego\nnetworks of journalists on Twitter, considering 17 different countries, and we\ninvestigate whether they feature the same characteristics observed for other\nrelevant classes of Twitter users, like politicians and generic users. Our\nfindings are that journalists are generally more active and interact with more\npeople than generic users, regardless of their country. Their ego network\nstructure is very aligned with reference models derived in anthropology and\nobserved in general human ego networks. Remarkably, the similarity is even\nhigher than the one of politicians and generic users ego networks. This may\nimply a greater cognitive involvement with Twitter for journalists than for\nother user categories. From a dynamic perspective, journalists have stable\nshort-term relationships that do not change much over time. In the longer term,\nthough, ego networks can be pretty dynamic, especially in the innermost\ncircles. Moreover, the ego-alter ties of journalists are often\ninformation-driven, as they are mediated by hashtags both at their inception\nand during their lifetime. Finally, we observe that highly popular journalists\ntend to engage with other journalists of similar popularity, and vice versa.\nJournalist egos also tend to keep their popular colleagues in the more intimate\nlayers, hence allocating more cognitive resources for them.",

Nowadays, oriented detectors mostly use\nhorizontal boxes as intermedium to derive oriented boxes from them. However,\nthe horizontal boxes are inclined to get a small Intersection-over-Unions\n(IoUs) with ground truths, which may have some undesirable effects, such as\nintroducing redundant noise, mismatching with ground truths, detracting from\nthe robustness of detectors, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel Anchor-free\nOriented Proposal Generator (AOPG) that abandons the horizontal boxes-related\noperations from the network architecture. AOPG first produces coarse oriented\nboxes by Coarse Location Module (CLM) in an anchor-free manner and then refines\nthem into high-quality oriented proposals. After AOPG, we apply a Fast R-CNN\nhead to produce the final detection results. Furthermore, the shortage of\nlarge-scale datasets is also a hindrance to the development of oriented object\ndetection.

Being capable of assessing, in real-time,\nthe operator's workload could help prevent calamitous events from occurring.\nThis workload estimation could enable an AI to make informed decisions to\nassist or advise the operator, in an advanced human-robot interaction\nframework. We propose a method, named Fessonia, for real-time cognitive\nworkload estimation from multiple parameters of an operator's driving behaviour\nvia the use of behavioural entropy. Fessonia is comprised of: a method to\ncalculate the entropy (i.e. unpredictability) of the operator driving behaviour\nprofile; the Driver Profile Update algorithm which adapts the entropy\ncalculations to the evolving driving profile of individual operators; and a\nWarning And Indication System that uses workload estimations to issue advice to\nthe operator. Fessonia is evaluated in a robot teleoperation scenario that\nincorporated cognitively demanding secondary tasks to induce varying degrees of\nworkload. The results demonstrate the ability of Fessonia to estimate different\nlevels of imposed workload. Additionally, it is demonstrated that our approach\nis able to detect and adapt to the evolving driving profile of the different\noperators.

Especially for continuous control,\nsolving this differential equation and its extension the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs\nequation, is important as it yields the optimal policy that achieves the\nmaximum reward on a give task. In the case of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs\nequation, which includes an adversary controlling the environment and\nminimizing the reward, the obtained policy is also robust to perturbations of\nthe dynamics. In this paper we propose continuous fitted value iteration (cFVI)\nand robust fitted value iteration (rFVI). These algorithms leverage the\nnon-linear control-affine dynamics and separable state and action reward of\nmany continuous control problems to derive the optimal policy and optimal\nadversary in closed form. This analytic expression simplifies the differential\nequations and enables us to solve for the optimal value function using value\niteration for continuous actions and states as well as the adversarial case.\nNotably, the resulting algorithms do not require discretization of states or\nactions. We apply the resulting algorithms to the Furuta pendulum and cartpole.\nWe show that both algorithms obtain the optimal policy. The robustness Sim2Real\nexperiments on the physical systems show that the policies successfully achieve\nthe task in the real-world. When changing the masses of the pendulum, we\nobserve that robust value iteration is more robust compared to deep\nreinforcement learning algorithm and the non-robust version of the algorithm.\nVideos of the experiments are shown at https://sites.google.com/view/rfvi",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks rely heavily on normalization methods to improve their\nperformance and learning behavior. Although normalization methods spurred the\ndevelopment of increasingly deep and efficient architectures, they also\nincrease the vulnerability with respect to noise and input corruptions. In most\napplications, however, noise is ubiquitous and diverse; this can often lead to\ncomplete failure of machine learning systems as they fail to cope with\nmismatches between the input distribution during training- and test-time. The\nmost common normalization method, batch normalization, reduces the distribution\nshift during training but is agnostic to changes in the input distribution\nduring test time. This makes batch normalization prone to performance\ndegradation whenever noise is present during test-time. Sample-based\nnormalization methods can correct linear transformations of the activation\ndistribution but cannot mitigate changes in the distribution shape; this makes\nthe network vulnerable to distribution changes that cannot be reflected in the\nnormalization parameters. We propose an unsupervised non-parametric\ndistribution correction method that adapts the activation distribution of each\nlayer. This reduces the mismatch between the training and test-time\ndistribution by minimizing the 1-D Wasserstein distance.

In a remote setting in which students cannot directly observe\ntheir peers, we aim to explore whether they behave differently when the\nperceived gender of their remote PP partners changes, searching for differences\nin (i) the perceived productivity compared to solo programming; (ii) the\npartner's perceived technical competency compared to their own; (iii) the\npartner's perceived skill level; (iv) the interaction behavior, such as the\nfrequency of source code additions, deletions, etc.; and (v) the type and\nrelative frequencies of dialog messages in a chat window.\nMethod. Using the twincode platform, several behaviors are automatically\nmeasured during the remote PP process, together with two questionnaires and a\nsemantic tagging of the pairs' chats. A series of experiments to identify the\neffect, if any, of possible gender bias shall be performed. The control group\nwill have no information about their partner's gender, whereas the treatment\ngroup will receive such information but will be selectively deceived about\ntheir partner's gender. For each response variable we will (i) compare control\nand experimental groups for the score distance between two in-pair tasks; then,\nusing the data from the experimental group only, we will (ii) compare scores\nusing the partner's perceived gender as a within-subjects variable; and (iii)\nanalyze the interaction between the partner's perceived gender and the\nsubject's gender.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel and well automatable approach to formal verification of\nprograms with underspecified semantics, i.e., a language semantics that leaves\nopen the order of certain evaluations. First, we reduce this problem to\nnon-determinism of distributed systems, automatically extracting a distributed\nActive Object model from underspecified, sequential C code. This translation\nprocess provides a fully formal semantics for the considered C subset. In the\nextracted model every non-deterministic choice corresponds to one possible\nevaluation order. This step also automatically translates specifications in the\nANSI/ISO C Specification Language (ACSL) into method contracts and object\ninvariants for Active Objects. We then perform verification on the specified\nActive Objects model. For this we have implemented a theorem prover Crowbar\nbased on the Behavioral Program Logic (BPL), which verifies the extracted model\nwith respect to the translated specification and ensures the original property\nof the C code for all possible evaluation orders. By using model extraction, we\ncan use standard tools, without designing a new complex program logic to deal\nwith underspecification. The case study used is highly underspecified and\ncannot be verified with existing tools for C.",

To\nenable our method, we introduce a novel metameric loss function that robustly\ncompares the statistics of two given images for a known gaze location. In\nparallel, we implement a model representing the relation between holograms and\ntheir image reconstructions.

A ProbLog program defines a distribution over\nlogic programs by specifying for each clause the probability that it belongs to\na randomly sampled program, and these probabilities are mutually independent.\nThe semantics of ProbLog is given by the success probability of a query, which\ncorresponds to the probability that the query succeeds in a randomly sampled\nprogram.

    "abstract": "Autonomous navigation requires structured representation of the road network\nand instance-wise identification of the other traffic agents. Since the traffic\nscene is defined on the ground plane, this corresponds to scene understanding\nin the bird's-eye-view (BEV). However, the onboard cameras of autonomous cars\nare customarily mounted horizontally for a better view of the surrounding,\nmaking this task very challenging. In this work, we study the problem of\nextracting a directed graph representing the local road network in BEV\ncoordinates, from a single onboard camera image. Moreover, we show that the\nmethod can be extended to detect dynamic objects on the BEV plane. The\nsemantics, locations, and orientations of the detected objects together with\nthe road graph facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the scene. Such\nunderstanding becomes fundamental for the downstream tasks, such as path\nplanning and navigation.

The aim of\nthis thesis is to assess how well Computational Fluid Dynamics can capture it.\nA Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach with a 2-dimensional domain was\nfirst used to simulate an offset jet on a flat plane. Whether it was for\n$k-\\omega$ SST or $k-\\epsilon$ turbulence model, a good prediction of the flow\nwas found. Since it is known that streamline curvature can have an important\nimpact on the numerical results, a jet blown tangentially to a cylinder was\nthen considered. Using the same approach as for the flat plane, with $k-\\omega$\nSST turbulence model, some of the flow features such as the separation location\nor velocity profiles near the jet exit were accurately predicted. However, the\njet development was overall poorly captured. A Curvature Correction was then\nintroduced in the turbulence model and if it did slightly improve the jet\ndevelopment, the negative impact on other quantities makes its benefits\nquestionable. Due to the known presence of longitudinal and spanwise vortices\nin the flow, a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach with a 3-dimensional\ndomain was attempted but was only able to reproduce the 2-dimensional results.\nAlthough if the longitudinal vortices are artificially generated at the inlet,\ntheir development is supported by the simulation. Finally, since the\nshortcomings of the numerical results obtained might be due to limitations of\nthe Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach, a Large Eddy Simulation was\nattempted. Unfortunately, due to time and computational restrictions a fully\ndeveloped flow could not be obtained, the methodology and preliminary results\nare however presented.",

    "abstract": "In robot localisation and mapping, outliers are unavoidable when loop-closure\nmeasurements are taken into account. A single false-positive loop-closure can\nhave a very negative impact on SLAM problems causing an inferior trajectory to\nbe produced or even for the optimisation to fail entirely. To address this\nissue, popular existing approaches define a hard switch for each loop-closure\nconstraint. This paper presents AEROS, a novel approach to adaptively solve a\nrobust least-squares minimisation problem by adding just a single extra latent\nparameter. It can be used in the back-end component of the SLAM problem to\nenable generalised robust cost minimisation by simultaneously estimating the\ncontinuous latent parameter along with the set of sensor poses in a single\njoint optimisation. This leads to a very closely curve fitting on the\ndistribution of the residuals, thereby reducing the effect of outliers.\nAdditionally, we formulate the robust optimisation problem using standard\nGaussian factors so that it can be solved by direct application of popular\nincremental estimation approaches such as iSAM. Experimental results on\npublicly available synthetic datasets and real LiDAR-SLAM datasets collected\nfrom the 2D and 3D LiDAR systems show the competitiveness of our approach with\nthe state-of-the-art techniques and its superiority on real world scenarios.",

The power of this\nmodel is provided by using hyper-nodes and hyper-edges, which allows to present\ndata structures on different abstraction levels. We prove that the model is at\nleast equivalent in expressive power to most popular data models. Therefore, it\ncan be used as a supermodel for model management and data integration.

Since big labelled datasets are rare, in particular for\nnon-English languages, and expensive, recent studies focus on unsupervised\napproaches that require not-paired input sentences. We instead propose a\nlanguage-independent approach to build large datasets of pairs of informal\ntexts weakly similar, without manual human effort, exploiting Twitter's\nintrinsic powerful signals of relatedness: replies and quotes of tweets. We use\nthe collected pairs to train a Transformer model with triplet-like structures,\nand we test the generated embeddings on Twitter NLP similarity tasks (PIT and\nTURL) and STSb. We also introduce four new sentence ranking evaluation\nbenchmarks of informal texts, carefully extracted from the initial collections\nof tweets, proving not only that our best model learns classical Semantic\nTextual Similarity, but also excels on tasks where pairs of sentences are not\nexact paraphrases. Ablation studies reveal how increasing the corpus size\ninfluences positively the results, even at 2M samples, suggesting that bigger\ncollections of Tweets still do not contain redundant information about semantic\nsimilarities.",

Finally, we apply ARDMs to lossless compression,\nand show that they are uniquely suited to this task. Contrary to existing\napproaches based on bits-back coding, ARDMs obtain compelling results not only\non complete datasets, but also on compressing single data points.

    "abstract": "Natural language free-text explanation generation is an efficient approach to\ntrain explainable language processing models for\ncommonsense-knowledge-requiring tasks. The most predominant form of these\nmodels is the explain-then-predict (EtP) structure, which first generates\nexplanations and uses them for making decisions. The performance of EtP models\nis highly dependent on that of the explainer by the nature of their structure.\nTherefore, large-sized explanation data are required to train a good explainer\nmodel. However, annotating explanations is expensive. Also, recent works reveal\nthat free-text explanations might not convey sufficient information for\ndecision making. These facts cast doubts on the effectiveness of EtP models. In\nthis paper, we argue that the predict-then-explain (PtE) architecture is a more\nefficient approach in terms of the modelling perspective. Our main contribution\nis twofold. First, we show that the PtE structure is the most data-efficient\napproach when explanation data are lacking. Second, we reveal that the PtE\nstructure is always more training-efficient than the EtP structure. We also\nprovide experimental results that confirm the theoretical advantages.",

    "abstract": "Various data mining tasks have been proposed to study Community Question\nAnswering (CQA) platforms like Stack Overflow. The relatedness between some of\nthese tasks provides useful learning signals to each other via Multi-Task\nLearning (MTL). However, due to the high heterogeneity of these tasks, few\nexisting works manage to jointly solve them in a unified framework. To tackle\nthis challenge, we develop a multi-relational graph based MTL model called\nHeterogeneous Multi-Task Graph Isomorphism Network (HMTGIN) which efficiently\nsolves heterogeneous CQA tasks. In each training forward pass, HMTGIN embeds\nthe input CQA forum graph by an extension of Graph Isomorphism Network and skip\nconnections. The embeddings are then shared across all task-specific output\nlayers to compute respective losses. Moreover, two cross-task constraints based\non the domain knowledge about tasks' relationships are used to regularize the\njoint learning. In the evaluation, the embeddings are shared among different\ntask-specific output layers to make corresponding predictions. To the best of\nour knowledge, HMTGIN is the first MTL model capable of tackling CQA tasks from\nthe aspect of multi-relational graphs. To evaluate HMTGIN's effectiveness, we\nbuild a novel large-scale multi-relational graph CQA dataset with over two\nmillion nodes from Stack Overflow. Extensive experiments show that: $(1)$\nHMTGIN is superior to all baselines on five tasks; $(2)$ The proposed MTL\nstrategy and cross-task constraints have substantial advantages.",

The information in documents is\ntypically in natural language, but can be organized in various layouts and\nformats. There have been recent spurt of interest in understanding document\ncontent with novel deep learning architectures. However, document understanding\ntasks need dense information annotations, which are costly to scale and\ngeneralize. Several active learning techniques have been proposed to reduce the\noverall budget of annotation while maintaining the performance of the\nunderlying deep learning model. However, most of these techniques work only for\nclassification problems. But content detection is a more complex task, and has\nbeen scarcely explored in active learning literature. In this paper, we propose\n\\textit{OPAD}, a novel framework using reinforcement policy for active learning\nin content detection tasks for documents. The proposed framework learns the\nacquisition function to decide the samples to be selected while optimizing\nperformance metrics that the tasks typically have.

    "abstract": "The importance of open bibliographic repositories is widely accepted by the\nscientific community. For evaluation processes, however, there is still some\nskepticism: even if large repositories of open access articles and free\npublication indexes exist and are continuously growing, assessment procedures\nstill rely on proprietary databases in many countries. This is mainly due to\nthe richness of the data available in these proprietary databases and the\nservices provided by the companies they are offered by. This paper investigates\nthe current status of open bibliographic data, in particular of three of the\nmost used open resources, namely Microsoft Academic Graph, Crossref and\nOpenAIRE, evaluating their potentialities as substitutes of proprietary\ndatabases for academic evaluation processes. In particular, we focused on the\nItalian National Scientific Qualification (NSQ), the National process for\nUniversity Professor qualification in Italy, which uses data from commercial\nindexes, and investigated similarities and differences between research areas,\ndisciplines and application roles. The main conclusion is that open datasets\nare ready to be used for some disciplines, even if there is still room for\nimprovement, but there is still a large gap to fill in others and a stronger\neffort is required from researchers and institutions.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel computational model for the numerical simulation of the\nblood flow in the human heart by focusing on 3D fluid dynamics of the left\nheart. With this aim, we employ the Navier-Stokes equations in an Arbitrary\nLagrangian Eulerian formulation to account for the endocardium motion, and we\nmodel both the mitral and the aortic valves by means of the Resistive Immersed\nImplicit Surface method. To impose a physiological displacement of the domain\nboundary, we use a 3D cardiac electromechanical model of the left ventricle\ncoupled to a lumped-parameter (0D) closed-loop model of the circulation and the\nremaining cardiac chambers, including the left atrium. To extend the left\nventricle motion to the endocardium of the left atrium and the ascending aorta,\nwe introduce a preprocessing procedure that combines an harmonic extension of\nthe left ventricle displacement with the motion of the left atrium based on the\n0D model. We thus obtain a one-way coupled electromechanics-fluid dynamics\nmodel in the left ventricle. To better match the 3D CFD with blood circulation,\nwe also couple the 3D Navier-Stokes equations - with domain motion driven by\nelectromechanics - to the 0D circulation model. We obtain a multiscale coupled\n3D-0D fluid dynamics model that we solve via a segregated numerical scheme. We\ncarry out numerical simulations for a healthy left heart and we validate our\nmodel by showing that significant hemodynamic indicators are correctly\nreproduced. We finally show that our model is able to simulate the blood flow\nin the left heart in the scenario of mitral valve regurgitation.",

    "abstract": "In medical image segmentation, supervised deep networks' success comes at the\ncost of requiring abundant labeled data. While asking domain experts to\nannotate only one or a few of the cohort's images is feasible, annotating all\navailable images is impractical. This issue is further exacerbated when\npre-trained deep networks are exposed to a new image dataset from an unfamiliar\ndistribution. Using available open-source data for ad-hoc transfer learning or\nhand-tuned techniques for data augmentation only provides suboptimal solutions.\nMotivated by atlas-based segmentation, we propose a novel volumetric\nself-supervised learning for data augmentation capable of synthesizing\nvolumetric image-segmentation pairs via learning transformations from a single\nlabeled atlas to the unlabeled data. Our work's central tenet benefits from a\ncombined view of one-shot generative learning and the proposed self-supervised\ntraining strategy that cluster unlabeled volumetric images with similar styles\ntogether. Unlike previous methods, our method does not require input volumes at\ninference time to synthesize new images. Instead, it can generate diversified\nvolumetric image-segmentation pairs from a prior distribution given a single or\nmulti-site dataset. Augmented data generated by our method used to train the\nsegmentation network provide significant improvements over state-of-the-art\ndeep one-shot learning methods on the task of brain MRI segmentation. Ablation\nstudies further exemplified that the proposed appearance model and joint\ntraining are crucial to synthesize realistic examples compared to existing\nmedical registration methods.

    "abstract": "This thesis focuses on video understanding for human action and interaction\nrecognition. We start by identifying the main challenges related to action\nrecognition from videos and review how they have been addressed by current\nmethods.\nBased on these challenges, and by focusing on the temporal aspect of actions,\nwe argue that current fixed-sized spatio-temporal kernels in 3D convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) can be improved to better deal with temporal variations\nin the input. Our contributions are based on the enlargement of the\nconvolutional receptive fields through the introduction of spatio-temporal\nsize-varying segments of videos, as well as the discovery of the local feature\nrelevance over the entire video sequence. The resulting extracted features\nencapsulate information that includes the importance of local features across\nmultiple temporal durations, as well as the entire video sequence.\nSubsequently, we study how we can better handle variations between classes of\nactions, by enhancing their feature differences over different layers of the\narchitecture. The hierarchical extraction of features models variations of\nrelatively similar classes the same as very dissimilar classes. Therefore,\ndistinctions between similar classes are less likely to be modelled. The\nproposed approach regularises feature maps by amplifying features that\ncorrespond to the class of the video that is processed. We move away from\nclass-agnostic networks and make early predictions based on feature\namplification mechanism.\nThe proposed approaches are evaluated on several benchmark action recognition\ndatasets and show competitive results. In terms of performance, we compete with\nthe state-of-the-art while being more efficient in terms of GFLOPs.\nFinally, we present a human-understandable approach aimed at providing visual\nexplanations for features learned over spatio-temporal networks.",

However, these\nmethods rely on the assumed structure and probabilities of certain system\ntransitions. These assumptions may be incorrect, and may even be violated in\nthe event that an adversary gains control of some or all components in the\nsystem.\nIn this paper, motivated by research in adversarial machine learning on\nadversarial examples, we develop a formal framework for adversarial robustness\nin systems defined as discrete time Markov chains (DTMCs), and extend to\ninclude deterministic, memoryless policies acting in Markov decision processes\n(MDPs). Our framework includes a flexible approach for specifying several\nadversarial models with different capabilities to manipulate the system. We\noutline a class of threat models under which adversaries can perturb system\ntransitions, constrained by an $\\varepsilon$ ball around the original\ntransition probabilities and define four specific instances of this threat\nmodel.\nWe define three main DTMC adversarial robustness problems and present two\noptimization-based solutions, leveraging traditional and parametric\nprobabilistic model checking techniques. We then evaluate our solutions on two\nstochastic protocols and a collection of GridWorld case studies, which model an\nagent acting in an environment described as an MDP. We find that the parametric\nsolution results in fast computation for small parameter spaces. In the case of\nless restrictive (stronger) adversaries, the number of parameters increases,\nand directly computing property satisfaction probabilities is more scalable.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a modified conditional generative adversarial network\n(cGAN) model to generate net load scenarios for power systems that are\nstatistically credible, conditioned by given labels (e.g., seasons), and, at\nthe same time, \"stressful\" to the system operations and dispatch decisions. The\nmeasure of stress used in this paper is based on the operating cost increases\ndue to net load changes. The proposed operation-adversarial cGAN (OA-cGAN)\ninternalizes a DC optimal power flow model and seeks to maximize the operating\ncost for to achieve a worst-case data generation. The training and testing\nstages employed in the proposed OA-cGAN use historical day-ahead net load\nforecast errors and has been implemented for the realistic NYISO 11-zone\nsystem. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the generated\noperation-adversarial forecast errors lead to more cost-effective and reliable\ndispatch decisions.",

    "abstract": "We present new mechanisms for \\emph{label differential privacy}, a relaxation\nof differentially private machine learning that only protects the privacy of\nthe labels in the training set. Our mechanisms cluster the examples in the\ntraining set using their (non-private) feature vectors, randomly re-sample each\nlabel from examples in the same cluster, and output a training set with noisy\nlabels as well as a modified version of the true loss function. We prove that\nwhen the clusters are both large and high-quality, the model that minimizes the\nmodified loss on the noisy training set converges to small excess risk at a\nrate that is comparable to the rate for non-private learning. We describe both\na centralized mechanism in which the entire training set is stored by a trusted\ncurator, and a distributed mechanism where each user stores a single labeled\nexample and replaces her label with the label of a randomly selected user from\nthe same cluster. We also describe a learning problem in which large clusters\nare necessary to achieve both strong privacy and either good precision or good\nrecall. Our experiments show that randomizing the labels within each cluster\nsignificantly improves the privacy vs. accuracy trade-off compared to applying\nuniform randomized response to the labels, and also compared to learning a\nmodel via DP-SGD.",

Experimental results for six\ndatasets demonstrate that using these deterministic coding matrices for $N$-ary\nECOC classification yields comparable and in many cases higher accuracy\ncompared to using randomly generated coding matrices. This is particular true\nwhen $N$ is adaptively chosen so that the dimension of $M$ matches closely with\nthe number of classes in a dataset, which reduces the loss in minimum Hamming\ndistance when $M$ is truncated to fit the dataset.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) typically relies on synchronous training, which is\nslow due to stragglers. While asynchronous training handles stragglers\nefficiently, it does not ensure privacy due to the incompatibility with the\nsecure aggregation protocols. A buffered asynchronous training protocol known\nas FedBuff has been proposed recently which bridges the gap between synchronous\nand asynchronous training to mitigate stragglers and to also ensure privacy\nsimultaneously. FedBuff allows the users to send their updates asynchronously\nwhile ensuring privacy by storing the updates in a trusted execution\nenvironment (TEE) enabled private buffer. TEEs, however, have limited memory\nwhich limits the buffer size. Motivated by this limitation, we develop a\nbuffered asynchronous secure aggregation (BASecAgg) protocol that does not rely\non TEEs. The conventional secure aggregation protocols cannot be applied in the\nbuffered asynchronous setting since the buffer may have local models\ncorresponding to different rounds and hence the masks that the users use to\nprotect their models may not cancel out. BASecAgg addresses this challenge by\ncarefully designing the masks such that they cancel out even if they correspond\nto different rounds. Our convergence analysis and experiments show that\nBASecAgg almost has the same convergence guarantees as FedBuff without relying\non TEEs.",

Following recent works, we consider broad classes of problems\nwhere either (i) the optimal value function $v^\\star$ or (ii) the optimal\naction-value function $q^\\star$ lie in the linear span of some features; or\n(iii) both $v^\\star$ and $q^\\star$ lie in the linear span when restricted to\nthe states reachable from the starting state. Recently, Weisz et al.

(2021a) introduced\nTensorPlan, a planner whose query cost is polynomial in all relevant quantities\nwhen the number of actions is fixed. Among other things, these two works left\nopen the question whether polynomial query complexity is possible when $A$ is\nsubexponential in $min(d,H)$. In this paper we answer this question in the\nnegative: we show that an exponentially large lower bound holds when\n$A=\\Omega(\\min(d^{1/4},H^{1/2}))$, under either (i), (ii) or (iii). In\nparticular, this implies a perhaps surprising exponential separation of query\ncomplexity compared to the work of Du et al.

Initially, the location of the\ntweets is determined using a dictionary prepared through the Geo-Names\ngeographic database, which contains detailed and complete information of places\nsuch as city names, streets, and postal codes. Then, using a large dictionary\nprepared from the terms of economics, related tweets are extracted and\nsentiments corresponded to tweets are analyzed with the help of the RoBERTa\nlanguage-based model, which has high accuracy and good performance. Finally,\nthe frequency chart of tweets related to the economy and their sentiment scores\n(positive and negative tweets) is plotted over time for the entire world and\nthe top 10 economies. From the analysis of the charts, we learn that the reason\nfor publishing economic tweets is not only the increase in the number of people\ninfected with the Coronavirus but also imposed restrictions and lockdowns in\ncountries. The consequences of these restrictions include the loss of millions\nof jobs and the economic downturn.",

    "abstract": "We present Mix3D, a data augmentation technique for segmenting large-scale 3D\nscenes. Since scene context helps reasoning about object semantics, current\nworks focus on models with large capacity and receptive fields that can fully\ncapture the global context of an input 3D scene. However, strong contextual\npriors can have detrimental implications like mistaking a pedestrian crossing\nthe street for a car. In this work, we focus on the importance of balancing\nglobal scene context and local geometry, with the goal of generalizing beyond\nthe contextual priors in the training set. In particular, we propose a \"mixing\"\ntechnique which creates new training samples by combining two augmented scenes.\nBy doing so, object instances are implicitly placed into novel out-of-context\nenvironments and therefore making it harder for models to rely on scene context\nalone, and instead infer semantics from local structure as well. We perform\ndetailed analysis to understand the importance of global context, local\nstructures and the effect of mixing scenes. In experiments, we show that models\ntrained with Mix3D profit from a significant performance boost on indoor\n(ScanNet, S3DIS) and outdoor datasets (SemanticKITTI). Mix3D can be trivially\nused with any existing method, e.g., trained with Mix3D, MinkowskiNet\noutperforms all prior state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on the\nScanNet test benchmark 78.1 mIoU.

    "abstract": "It is well-known that machine learning protocols typically under-utilize\ninformation on the probability distributions of feature vectors and related\ndata, and instead directly compute regression or classification functions of\nfeature vectors. In this paper we introduce a set of novel features for\nidentifying underlying stochastic behavior of input data using the\nKarhunen-Lo\\'{e}ve (KL) expansion, where classification is treated as detection\nof anomalies from a (nominal) signal class. These features are constructed from\nthe recent Functional Data Analysis (FDA) theory for anomaly detection. The\nrelated signal decomposition is an exact hierarchical tensor product expansion\nwith known optimality properties for approximating stochastic processes (random\nfields) with finite dimensional function spaces. In principle these primary low\ndimensional spaces can capture most of the stochastic behavior of `underlying\nsignals' in a given nominal class, and can reject signals in alternative\nclasses as stochastic anomalies. Using a hierarchical finite dimensional KL\nexpansion of the nominal class, a series of orthogonal nested subspaces is\nconstructed for detecting anomalous signal components. Projection coefficients\nof input data in these subspaces are then used to train an ML classifier.\nHowever, due to the split of the signal into nominal and anomalous projection\ncomponents, clearer separation surfaces of the classes arise. In fact we show\nthat with a sufficiently accurate estimation of the covariance structure of the\nnominal class, a sharp classification can be obtained. We carefully formulate\nthis concept and demonstrate it on a number of high-dimensional datasets in\ncancer diagnostics.

Despite the effectiveness of\nthese techniques, their potential for energy savings are potentially\nunderutilized due to the fact that energy demands are often assumed to be fixed\nquantities rather than controlled dynamic variables. The joint optimization of\nenergy hubs and buildings' energy management systems can result in higher\nenergy savings. This paper investigates how different MPC strategies perform on\nenergy management systems in buildings and energy hubs. We first discuss two\nMPC approaches; centralized and decentralized. While the centralized control\nstrategy offers optimal performance, its implementation is computationally\nprohibitive and raises privacy concerns. On the other hand, the decentralized\ncontrol approach, which offers ease of implementation, displays significantly\nlower performance. We propose a third strategy, distributed control based on\ndual decomposition, which has the advantages of both approaches. Numerical case\nstudies and comparisons demonstrate that the performance of distributed control\nis close to the performance of the centralized case, while maintaining a\nsignificantly lower computational burden, especially in large-scale scenarios\nwith many agents.

    "title": "Proxy-bridged Image Reconstruction Network for Anomaly Detection in  Medical Images",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in medical images refers to the identification of abnormal\nimages with only normal images in the training set. Most existing methods solve\nthis problem with a self-reconstruction framework, which tends to learn an\nidentity mapping and reduces the sensitivity to anomalies. To mitigate this\nproblem, in this paper, we propose a novel Proxy-bridged Image Reconstruction\nNetwork (ProxyAno) for anomaly detection in medical images. Specifically, we\nuse an intermediate proxy to bridge the input image and the reconstructed\nimage. We study different proxy types, and we find that the superpixel-image\n(SI) is the best one. We set all pixels' intensities within each superpixel as\ntheir average intensity, and denote this image as SI. The proposed ProxyAno\nconsists of two modules, a Proxy Extraction Module and an Image Reconstruction\nModule. In the Proxy Extraction Module, a memory is introduced to memorize the\nfeature correspondence for normal image to its corresponding SI, while the\nmemorized correspondence does not apply to the abnormal images, which leads to\nthe information loss for abnormal image and facilitates the anomaly detection.\nIn the Image Reconstruction Module, we map an SI to its reconstructed image.\nFurther, we crop a patch from the image and paste it on the normal SI to mimic\nthe anomalies, and enforce the network to reconstruct the normal image even\nwith the pseudo abnormal SI. In this way, our network enlarges the\nreconstruction error for anomalies. Extensive experiments on brain MR images,\nretinal OCT images and retinal fundus images verify the effectiveness of our\nmethod for both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes is a global raising pandemic. Diabetes patients are at risk of\ndeveloping foot ulcer that usually leads to limb amputation. In order to\ndevelop a self monitoring mobile application, in this work, we propose a novel\ndeep subspace analysis pipeline for semi-supervised diabetic foot ulcer\nmulit-label classification. To avoid any chance of over-fitting, unlike recent\nstate of the art deep semi-supervised methods, the proposed pipeline dose not\ninclude any data augmentation. Whereas, after extracting deep features, in\norder to make the representation shift invariant, we employ variety of data\naugmentation methods on each image and generate an image-sets, which is then\nmapped into a linear subspace. Moreover, the proposed pipeline reduces the cost\nof retraining when more new unlabelled data become available. Thus, the first\nstage of the pipeline employs the concept of transfer learning for feature\nextraction purpose through modifying and retraining a deep convolutional\nnetwork architect known as Xception. Then, the output of a mid-layer is\nextracted to generate an image set representer of any given image with help of\ndata augmentation methods. At this stage, each image is transferred to a linear\nsubspace which is a point on a Grassmann Manifold topological space. Hence, to\nperform analyse them, the geometry of such manifold must be considered. As\nsuch, each labelled image is represented as a vector of distances to number of\nunlabelled images using geodesic distance on Grassmann manifold. Finally,\nRandom Forest is trained for multi-label classification of diabetic foot ulcer\nimages. The method is then evaluated on the blind test set provided by DFU2021\ncompetition, and the result considerable improvement compared to using\nclassical transfer learning with data augmentation.",

Prevalent block matching based methods that\nare used to compute block motion vectors (MVs) rely on computationally\nintensive search procedures.

Moreover, the block matching criteria\nused in typical codecs do not account for the resulting levels of perceptual\nquality of the motion compensated pictures that are created upon decoding.\nTowards achieving the elusive goal of perceptually optimized motion estimation,\nwe propose a search-free block motion estimation framework using a multi-stage\nconvolutional neural network, which is able to conduct motion estimation on\nmultiple block sizes simultaneously, using a triplet of frames as input.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a dominant paradigm for\nmachine learning with graphs. Research on GNNs has mainly focused on the family\nof message passing neural networks (MPNNs). Similar to the Weisfeiler-Leman\n(WL) test of isomorphism, these models follow an iterative neighborhood\naggregation procedure to update vertex representations, and they next compute\ngraph representations by aggregating the representations of the vertices.\nAlthough very successful, MPNNs have been studied intensively in the past few\nyears. Thus, there is a need for novel architectures which will allow research\nin the field to break away from MPNNs. In this paper, we propose a new graph\nneural network model, so-called $\\pi$-GNN which learns a \"soft\" permutation\n(i.e., doubly stochastic) matrix for each graph, and thus projects all graphs\ninto a common vector space. The learned matrices impose a \"soft\" ordering on\nthe vertices of the input graphs, and based on this ordering, the adjacency\nmatrices are mapped into vectors. These vectors can be fed into fully-connected\nor convolutional layers to deal with supervised learning tasks. In case of\nlarge graphs, to make the model more efficient in terms of running time and\nmemory, we further relax the doubly stochastic matrices to row stochastic\nmatrices. We empirically evaluate the model on graph classification and graph\nregression datasets and show that it achieves performance competitive with\nstate-of-the-art models.",

    "abstract": "We study the classification problem for high-dimensional data with $n$\nobservations on $p$ features where the $p \\times p$ covariance matrix $\\Sigma$\nexhibits a spiked eigenvalues structure and the vector $\\zeta$, given by the\ndifference between the whitened mean vectors, is sparse with sparsity at most\n$s$. We propose an adaptive classifier (adaptive with respect to the sparsity\n$s$) that first performs dimension reduction on the feature vectors prior to\nclassification in the dimensionally reduced space, i.e., the classifier\nwhitened the data, then screen the features by keeping only those corresponding\nto the $s$ largest coordinates of $\\zeta$ and finally apply Fisher linear\ndiscriminant on the selected features. Leveraging recent results on entrywise\nmatrix perturbation bounds for covariance matrices, we show that the resulting\nclassifier is Bayes optimal whenever $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $s \\sqrt{n^{-1}\n\\ln p} \\rightarrow 0$. Experimental results on real and synthetic data sets\nindicate that the proposed classifier is competitive with existing\nstate-of-the-art methods while also selecting a smaller number of features.",

The missing mass of a\nfunction generalizes the classical missing mass, and has several interesting\nconnections to other related estimation problems. Minimax estimation is studied\nfor order-$\\alpha$ missing mass ($g(p)=p^{\\alpha}$) for both integer and\nnon-integer values of $\\alpha$. Exact minimax convergence rates are obtained\nfor the integer case. Concentration is studied for a class of functions and\nspecific results are derived for order-$\\alpha$ missing mass and missing\nShannon entropy ($g(p)=-p\\log p$). Sub-Gaussian tail bounds with near-optimal\nworst-case variance factors are derived.

An output denormalization technique is used to obtain accurate\ntuning of the IIR filters center frequency, quality factor and gain. All layers\ninvolved in the proposed method are shown to be differentiable, allowing\nbackpropagation to optimize the network weights and achieve, after a number of\ntraining iterations, the optimal output. The parameters are optimized with\nrespect to a loss function based on a spectral distance between the measured\nand desired magnitude response, and a regularization term used to achieve a\nspatialization of the acoustc scene. Two scenarios with different\ncharacteristics were considered for the experimental evaluation: a room and a\ncar cabin. The performance of the proposed method improves over the baseline\ntechniques and achieves an almost flat band.

This has led to increased demand for credit cards,\nbringing along with it the possibility of higher credit defaults and hence\nhigher delinquency rates, over a period of time. The purpose of this research\npaper is to build a contemporary credit scoring model to forecast credit\ndefaults for unsecured lending (credit cards), by employing machine learning\ntechniques. As much of the customer payments data available to lenders, for\nforecasting Credit defaults, is imbalanced (skewed), on account of a limited\nsubset of default instances, this poses a challenge for predictive modelling.\nIn this research, this challenge is addressed by deploying Synthetic Minority\nOversampling Technique (SMOTE), a proven technique to iron out such imbalances,\nfrom a given dataset. On running the research dataset through seven different\nmachine learning models, the results indicate that the Light Gradient Boosting\nMachine (LGBM) Classifier model outperforms the other six classification\ntechniques. Thus, our research indicates that the LGBM classifier model is\nbetter equipped to deliver higher learning speeds, better efficiencies and\nmanage larger data volumes.

    "abstract": "Despite the proliferation of numerous deep learning methods proposed for\ngeneric ECG classification and arrhythmia detection, compact systems with the\nreal-time ability and high accuracy for classifying patient-specific ECG are\nstill few. Particularly, the scarcity of patient-specific data poses an\nultimate challenge to any classifier. Recently, compact 1D Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) have achieved the state-of-the-art performance level for the\naccurate classification of ventricular and supraventricular ectopic beats.\nHowever, several studies have demonstrated the fact that the learning\nperformance of the conventional CNNs is limited because they are homogenous\nnetworks with a basic (linear) neuron model. In order to address this\ndeficiency and further boost the patient-specific ECG classification\nperformance, in this study, we propose 1D Self-organized Operational Neural\nNetworks (1D Self-ONNs). Due to its self-organization capability, Self-ONNs\nhave the utmost advantage and superiority over conventional ONNs where the\nprior operator search within the operator set library to find the best possible\nset of operators is entirely avoided. As the first study where 1D Self-ONNs are\never proposed for a classification task, our results over the MIT-BIH\narrhythmia benchmark database demonstrate that 1D Self-ONNs can surpass 1D CNNs\nwith a significant margin while having a similar computational complexity.\nUnder AAMI recommendations and with minimal common training data used, over the\nentire MIT-BIH dataset 1D Self-ONNs have achieved 98% and 99.04% average\naccuracies, 76.6% and 93.7% average F1 scores on supra-ventricular and\nventricular ectopic beat (VEB) classifications, respectively, which is the\nhighest performance level ever reported.",
