This allows the explicit, highly parallelisable LBM to\nefficiently solve the fundamental equations of solid mechanics: the\nconservation of mass, the balance of linear momentum, and constitutive\nrelations.\nTo date, all LBM algorithms for solid simulation - see e.g. Murthy et al.\n[2017], Escande et al. [2020], Schl\\\"uter et al. [2021] - have been limited to\nthe small strain case. Furthermore, the typical interpretation of the LBM in\nthe current (Eulerian) configuration is not easily extensible to large strains,\nas large topological changes complicate the treatment of boundary conditions.\nIn this publication, we propose a large deformation Lattice Boltzmann Method\nfor geometrically and constitutively nonlinear solid mechanics. To facilitate\nversatile boundary modelling, the algorithm is defined in the reference\n(Lagrangian) configuration.",

    "abstract": "The Extended Discrete Element Method (XDEM) is an innovative numerical\nsimulation technique that extends the dynamics of granular materials known as\nDiscrete Element Method (DEM) by additional properties such as the\nthermodynamic state, stress/strain for each particle. Such DEM simulations used\nby industries to set up their experimental processes are complexes and heavy in\ncomputation time.\nAt each time step, those simulations generate a list of interacting particles\nand this phase is one of the most computationally expensive parts of a DEM\nsimulation. The Verlet buffer method, initially introduced in Molecular Dynamic\n(MD) (and also used in DEM), allows keeping the interaction list for many time\nsteps by extending each particle neighbourhood by a certain extension range,\nand thus broadening the interaction list. The method relies on the temporal\ncoherency of DEM, which guarantees that no particles move erratically from one\ntime step to the next. In the classical approach, all the particles have their\nneighbourhood extended by the same value which leads to suboptimal performances\nin simulations where different flow regimes coexist. Additionally, and unlike\nin MD, there is no comprehensive study analysing the different parameters that\naffect the performance of the Verlet buffer method in DEM.\nIn this work, we propose a new method for the dynamic update of the neighbour\nlist that depends on the particles individual displacement and define a\nparticle-specific extension range based on the local flow regime. The\ninteraction list is analysed throughout the simulation based on the particle's\ndisplacement allowing a flexible update according to the flow regime\nconditions. We evaluate the influence of the Verlet extension range on the\nexecution time through different test cases and analyse empirically the\nextension range value giving the best performance.",

    "abstract": "Needle-in-a-Haystack problems exist across a wide range of applications\nincluding rare disease prediction, ecological resource management, fraud\ndetection, and material property optimization. A Needle-in-a-Haystack problem\narises when there is an extreme imbalance of optimum conditions relative to the\nsize of the dataset. For example, only 0.82% out of 146k total materials in the\nopen-access Materials Project database have a negative Poisson's ratio.\nHowever, current state-of-the-art optimization algorithms are not designed with\nthe capabilities to find solutions to these challenging multidimensional\nNeedle-in-a-Haystack problems, resulting in slow convergence to a global\noptimum or pigeonholing into a local minimum. In this paper, we present a\nZooming Memory-Based Initialization algorithm, entitled ZoMBI, that builds on\nconventional Bayesian optimization principles to quickly and efficiently\noptimize Needle-in-a-Haystack problems in both less time and fewer experiments\nby addressing the common convergence and pigeonholing issues. ZoMBI actively\nextracts knowledge from the previously best-performing evaluated experiments to\niteratively zoom in the sampling search bounds towards the global optimum\n\"needle\" and then prunes the memory of low-performing historical experiments to\naccelerate compute times. We validate the algorithm's performance on two\nreal-world 5-dimensional Needle-in-a-Haystack material property optimization\ndatasets: discovery of auxetic Poisson's ratio materials and discovery of high\nthermoelectric figure of merit materials. The ZoMBI algorithm demonstrates\ncompute time speed-ups of 400x compared to traditional Bayesian optimization as\nwell as efficiently discovering materials in under 100 experiments that are up\nto 3x more highly optimized than those discovered by current state-of-the-art\nalgorithms.",

The multi-scale deep supervision strategy is adopted on both decoders,\nwhich can alleviate the issues caused by variable organ sizes.

    "abstract": "Current approaches for points-of-interest (POI) recommendation learn the\npreferences of a user via the standard spatial features such as the POI\ncoordinates, the social network, etc. These models ignore a crucial aspect of\nspatial mobility -- every user carries their smartphones wherever they go. In\naddition, with growing privacy concerns, users refrain from sharing their exact\ngeographical coordinates and their social media activity. In this paper, we\npresent REVAMP, a sequential POI recommendation approach that utilizes the user\nactivity on smartphone applications (or apps) to identify their mobility\npreferences. This work aligns with the recent psychological studies of online\nurban users, which show that their spatial mobility behavior is largely\ninfluenced by the activity of their smartphone apps. In addition, our proposal\nof coarse-grained smartphone data refers to data logs collected in a\nprivacy-conscious manner, i.e., consisting only of (a) category of the\nsmartphone app and (b) category of check-in location. Thus, REVAMP is not privy\nto precise geo-coordinates, social networks, or the specific application being\naccessed. Buoyed by the efficacy of self-attention models, we learn the POI\npreferences of a user using two forms of positional encodings -- absolute and\nrelative -- with each extracted from the inter-check-in dynamics in the\ncheck-in sequence of a user.

Minsky and Papert considered elementary\nperceptrons with restrictions on the neural inputs: a bounded number of\nconnections or a relatively small diameter of the receptive field for each\nneuron at the hidden layer. They proved that under these constraints, an\nelementary perceptron cannot solve some problems, such as the connectivity of\ninput images or the parity of pixels in them. In this note, we demonstrated\nfirst Rosenblatt's theorem at work, showed how an elementary perceptron can\nsolve a version of the travel maze problem, and analysed the complexity of that\nsolution. We constructed also a deep network algorithm for the same problem. It\nis much more efficient. The shallow network uses an exponentially large number\nof neurons on the hidden layer (Rosenblatt's $A$-elements), whereas for the\ndeep network the second order polynomial complexity is sufficient. We\ndemonstrated that for the same complex problem deep network can be much smaller\nand reveal a heuristic behind this effect.",

By adding a Kullback-Liebler regularization function to the\nrobust min-max optimization problem, the learning problem can be reduced to a\nmodified robust minimization problem and solved efficiently.

We perform a\nplane-orthogonal-to-skin rPPG independently for locally defined regions of\ninterest on each scale. From the extracted signals, we derive the\nsignal-to-noise ratio, magnitude in the frequency domain, heart rate, perfusion\nindex as well as correlation between specific rPPG signals in order to locally\nassess the perfusion of a specific region of human tissue. We show that locally\nresolved rPPG has a broad range of applications. As exemplary applications, we\npresent results in intraoperative perfusion analysis and visualization during\nskin and organ transplantation as well as an application for liveliness\nassessment for the detection of presentation attacks to authentication systems.",

In such cases it is\nimportant to reason over the software to ascertain its correctness. The lack of\na formal iTasks semantics makes it unsuitable for formal reasoning. To this end\nTopHat has been developed as a TOP language with a formal semantics.

In computer science, it\nis called the Maximum Cut problem, one of the famous twenty-one Karp's original\nNP-hard problems, while the same object from Physics is called the Ising Spin\nGlass model. This model of a rich structure often appears as a reduction or\nreformulation of real-world problems from computer science, physics and\nengineering. However, solving this model exactly (finding the maximal cut or\nthe ground state) is likely to stay an intractable problem (unless $\\textit{P}\n= \\textit{NP}$) and requires the development of ad-hoc heuristics for every\nparticular family of instances.\nOne of the bright and beautiful connections between discrete and continuous\noptimization is a Semidefinite Programming-based rounding scheme for Maximum\nCut. This procedure allows us to find a provably near-optimal solution;\nmoreover, this method is conjectured to be the best possible in polynomial\ntime. In the first two chapters of this thesis, we investigate local non-convex\nheuristics intended to improve the rounding scheme.\nIn the last chapter of this thesis, we make one step further and aim to\ncontrol the solution of the problem we wanted to solve in previous chapters. We\nformulate a bi-level optimization problem over the Ising model where we want to\ntweak the interactions as little as possible so that the ground state of the\nresulting Ising model satisfies the desired criteria.

    "abstract": "In recent years, processing in memory (PIM) based mixedsignal designs have\nbeen proposed as energy- and area-efficient solutions with ultra high\nthroughput to accelerate DNN computations. However, PIM designs are sensitive\nto imperfections such as noise, weight and conductance variations that\nsubstantially degrade the DNN accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel algorithm-hardware co-design framework hereafter referred to as HybridAC\nthat simultaneously avoids accuracy degradation due to imperfections, improves\narea utilization, and reduces data movement and energy dissipation. We derive a\ndata-movement-aware weight selection method that does not require retraining to\npreserve its original performance. It computes a fraction of the results with a\nsmall number of variation-sensitive weights using a robust digital accelerator,\nwhile the main computation is performed in analog PIM units. This is the first\nwork that not only provides a variation-robust architecture, but also improves\nthe area, power, and energy of the existing designs considerably. HybridAC is\nadapted to leverage the preceding weight selection method by reducing ADC\nprecision, peripheral circuitry, and hybrid quantization to optimize the\ndesign. Our comprehensive experiments show that, even in the presence of\nvariation as high as 50%, HybridAC can reduce the accuracy degradation from 60\n- 90% (without protection) to 1 - 2% for different DNNs across diverse\ndatasets. In addition to providing more robust computation, compared to the\nISAAC (SRE), HybridAC improves the execution time, energy, area, power,\narea-efficiency, and power-efficiency by 26%(14%), 52%(40%), 28%(28%),\n57%(45%), 43%(5x), and 81%(3.9x), respectively",

However, real-world corpora typically present\nmultiple social categories that possibly correlate or intersect with each\nother. For instance, \"hair weaves\" is stereotypically associated with African\nAmerican females, but neither African American nor females alone. Therefore,\nthis work studies biases associated with multiple social categories: joint\nbiases induced by the union of different categories and intersectional biases\nthat do not overlap with the biases of the constituent categories. We first\nempirically observe that individual biases intersect non-trivially (i.e., over\na one-dimensional subspace). Drawing from the intersectional theory in social\nscience and the linguistic theory, we then construct an intersectional subspace\nto debias for multiple social categories using the nonlinear geometry of\nindividual biases. Empirical evaluations corroborate the efficacy of our\napproach. Data and implementation code can be downloaded at\nhttps://github.com/GitHubLuCheng/Implementation-of-JoSEC-COLING-22.",

    "abstract": "In conditionally automated driving, drivers decoupled from driving while\nimmersed in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs) could potentially either miss the\nsystem-initiated takeover request (TOR) or a sudden TOR may startle them. To\nbetter prepare drivers for a safer takeover in an emergency, we propose novel\ncontext-aware advisory warnings (CAWA) for automated driving to gently inform\ndrivers. This will help them stay vigilant while engaging in NDRTs. The key\ninnovation is that CAWA adapts warning modalities according to the context of\nNDRTs. We conducted a user study to investigate the effectiveness of CAWA. The\nstudy results show that CAWA has statistically significant effects on safer\ntakeover behavior, improved driver situational awareness, less attention\ndemand, and more positive user feedback, compared with uniformly distributed\nspeech-based warnings across all NDRTs.",

This\nwork investigates certified regression defenses, which provide guaranteed\nlimits on how much a regressor's prediction may change under a training-set\nattack. Our key insight is that certified regression reduces to certified\nclassification when using median as a model's primary decision function.\nCoupling our reduction with existing certified classifiers, we propose six new\nprovably-robust regressors. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first\nwork that certifies the robustness of individual regression predictions without\nany assumptions about the data distribution and model architecture. We also\nshow that existing state-of-the-art certified classifiers often make\noverly-pessimistic assumptions that can degrade their provable guarantees. We\nintroduce a tighter analysis of model robustness, which in many cases results\nin significantly improved certified guarantees.

Due to its large number of\napplications in various data analysis and optimization tasks, this problem has\nbeen actively studied recently.\nWe present an $O(\\log n)$-approximation algorithm for MVD, exponentially\nimproving the previous best approximation ratio of $O(OPT^{1/3})$ of Fan et al.\n[ SODA, 2018]. Furthermore, a major strength of our algorithm is its simplicity\nand running time. We also study the related problem of ULTRAMETRIC VIOLATION\nDISTANCE (UMVD), where the goal is to compute the $\\ell_0$ distance to the cone\nof ultrametrics, and achieve a constant factor approximation algorithm. The\nUMVD can be regarded as an extension of the problem of fitting ultrametrics\nstudied by Ailon and Charikar [SIAM J. Computing, 2011] and by Cohen-Addad et\nal. [FOCS, 2021] from $\\ell_1$ norm to $\\ell_0$ norm. We show that this problem\ncan be favorably interpreted as an instance of Correlation Clustering with an\nadditional hierarchical structure, which we solve using a new\n$O(1)$-approximation algorithm for correlation clustering that has the\nstructural property that it outputs a refinement of the optimum clusters. An\nalgorithm satisfying such a property can be considered of independent interest.\nWe also provide an $O(\\log n \\log \\log n)$ approximation algorithm for weighted\ninstances. Finally, we investigate the complementary version of these problems\nwhere one aims at choosing a maximum number of entries of $x$ forming an\n(ultra-)metric.

In this\npaper, we explore and evaluate transformer model fine-tuning for\npersonalization.

To test our\nhypothesis, we generate a synthetic outlier set by applying an additive-noise\nperturbation to ID samples at the image or bounding-box level. An auxiliary\nfeature monitoring multilayer perceptron (MLP) is then trained to detect OOD\nfeature representations using the perturbed ID samples as a proxy.

In the setting\nof Empirical Risk Minimization -- one of the fundamental optimization problems\nin statistical and machine learning -- the computational effectiveness of\nFrank-Wolfe methods typically grows linearly in the number of data observations\n$n$. This is in stark contrast to the case for typical stochastic projection\nmethods. In order to reduce this dependence on $n$, we look to second-order\nsmoothness of typical smooth loss functions (least squares loss and logistic\nloss, for example) and we propose amending the Frank-Wolfe method with Taylor\nseries-approximated gradients, including variants for both deterministic and\nstochastic settings.

In this paper, we propose 3 architectures to\nachieve this multi-label entity tagging: BiLSTM n-CRF, BiLSTM-CRF-Smax-TF and\nBiLSTM n-CRF-TF. We evaluate these methods on the 2010 i2b2/VA and the i2b2\n2012 shared task datasets. Our different models obtain best NER F1 scores of 0.\n894 and 0.808 on the i2b2 2010/VA and i2b2 2012 respectively. The highest span\nbased micro-averaged F1 polarity scores obtained were 0.832 and 0.836 on the\ni2b2 2010/VA and i2b2 2012 datasets respectively, and the highest\nmacro-averaged F1 polarity scores obtained were 0.924 and 0.888 respectively.\nThe modality studies conducted on i2b2 2012 dataset revealed high scores of\n0.818 and 0.501 for span based micro-averaged F1 and macro-averaged F1\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis has a wide range of applications due to its\ninformation complementarity in multimodal interactions. Previous works focus\nmore on investigating efficient joint representations, but they rarely consider\nthe insufficient unimodal features extraction and data redundancy of multimodal\nfusion. In this paper, a Video-based Cross-modal Auxiliary Network (VCAN) is\nproposed, which is comprised of an audio features map module and a cross-modal\nselection module. The first module is designed to substantially increase\nfeature diversity in audio feature extraction, aiming to improve classification\naccuracy by providing more comprehensive acoustic representations. To empower\nthe model to handle redundant visual features, the second module is addressed\nto efficiently filter the redundant visual frames during integrating\naudiovisual data. Moreover, a classifier group consisting of several image\nclassification networks is introduced to predict sentiment polarities and\nemotion categories. Extensive experimental results on RAVDESS, CMU-MOSI, and\nCMU-MOSEI benchmarks indicate that VCAN is significantly superior to the\nstate-of-the-art methods for improving the classification accuracy of\nmultimodal sentiment analysis.",

Besides, by intelligently\nreflecting the received signals, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)\ncan significantly improve the propagation environment and further enhance the\nservice quality of the UAV-enabled MEC.

The paper provides three compelling reasons\nto adopt fully Bayesian optimisation (FBO) as an alternative. First, failures\nof ML-II are more commonplace than implied by the existing studies using the\ncontrived settings. Second, FBO is more robust than ML-II, and the price of\nrobustness is almost trivial. Third, FBO has become simple to implement and\nfast enough to be practical. The paper supports the argument using relevant\nexperiments, which reflect the current practice regarding models, algorithms,\nand software platforms.

Split computing is an emerging machine-learning inference technique\nthat addresses the privacy and latency challenges of deploying deep learning in\nIoT systems. In split computing, neural network models are separated and\ncooperatively processed using edge servers and IoT devices via networks. Thus,\nthe architecture of the neural network model significantly impacts the\ncommunication payload size, model accuracy, and computational load. In this\npaper, we address the challenge of optimizing neural network architecture for\nsplit computing. To this end, we proposed NASC, which jointly explores optimal\nmodel architecture and a split point to achieve higher accuracy while meeting\nlatency requirements (i.e., smaller total latency of computation and\ncommunication than a certain threshold). NASC employs a one-shot NAS that does\nnot require repeating model training for a computationally efficient\narchitecture search. Our performance evaluation using hardware (HW)-NAS-Bench\nof benchmark data demonstrates that the proposed NASC can improve the\n``communication latency and model accuracy\" trade-off, i.e., reduce the latency\nby approximately 40-60% from the baseline, with slight accuracy degradation.",

Compared with traditional reflecting-only RIS, STAR-RIS extends the\nhalf-space coverage to full-space coverage by simultaneously transmitting and\nreflecting incident signals, and also provides new degrees-of-freedom (DoFs)\nfor manipulating signal propagation. We aim to maximize the total computation\nrate of all users, where the energy transfer time, transmit power and CPU\nfrequencies of users, and the configuration design of STAR-RIS are jointly\noptimized. Considering the characteristics of STAR-RIS, three operating\nprotocols, namely energy splitting (ES), mode switching (MS), and time\nsplitting (TS) are studied, respectively. For the ES protocol, based on the\npenalty method, successive convex approximation (SCA), and the linear search\nmethod, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated non-convex\nproblem. Then, the proposed algorithm for ES protocol is extended to solve the\nMS and TS problems. Simulation results illustrate that the STAR-RIS outperforms\ntraditional reflecting/transmitting-only RIS.

    "abstract": "Source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) aims to learn a target\ndomain model using unlabeled target data and the knowledge of a well-trained\nsource domain model. Most previous SFUDA works focus on inferring semantics of\ntarget data based on the source knowledge. Without measuring the\ntransferability of the source knowledge, these methods insufficiently exploit\nthe source knowledge, and fail to identify the reliability of the inferred\ntarget semantics. However, existing transferability measurements require either\nsource data or target labels, which are infeasible in SFUDA. To this end,\nfirstly, we propose a novel Uncertainty-induced Transferability Representation\n(UTR), which leverages uncertainty as the tool to analyse the channel-wise\ntransferability of the source encoder in the absence of the source data and\ntarget labels. The domain-level UTR unravels how transferable the encoder\nchannels are to the target domain and the instance-level UTR characterizes the\nreliability of the inferred target semantics. Secondly, based on the UTR, we\npropose a novel Calibrated Adaption Framework (CAF) for SFUDA, including i)the\nsource knowledge calibration module that guides the target model to learn the\ntransferable source knowledge and discard the non-transferable one, and ii)the\ntarget semantics calibration module that calibrates the unreliable semantics.\nWith the help of the calibrated source knowledge and the target semantics, the\nmodel adapts to the target domain safely and ultimately better.

Scholars have proposed various deep learning and machine learning\nalgorithms for wine quality prediction, such as Support vector machine (SVM),\nRandom Forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Deep neural network (DNN), and\nLogistic regression (LR). However, these methods ignore the inner relationship\nbetween the physical and chemical properties of the wine, for example, the\ncorrelations between pH values, fixed acidity, citric acid, and so on. To fill\nthe gap, this paper conducts the Pearson correlation analysis, PCA analysis,\nand Shapiro-Wilk test on those properties and incorporates 1D-CNN architecture\nto capture the correlations among neighboring features. In addition, it\nimplemented dropout and batch normalization techniques to improve the\nrobustness of the proposed model. Massive experiments have shown that our\nmethod can outperform baseline approaches in wine quality prediction. Moreover,\nablation experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating the\n1-D CNN module, Dropout, and normalization techniques.",

    "abstract": "Given a sound field generated by a sparse distribution of impulse image\nsources, can the continuous 3D positions and amplitudes of these sources be\nrecovered from discrete, bandlimited measurements of the field at a finite set\nof locations, e.g., a multichannel room impulse response? Borrowing from recent\nadvances in super-resolution imaging, it is shown that this nonlinear,\nnon-convex inverse problem can be efficiently relaxed into a convex linear\ninverse problem over the space of Radon measures in R3. The linear operator\nintroduced here stems from the fundamental solution of the free-field\ninhomogenous wave equation combined with the receivers' responses. An\nadaptation of the Sliding Frank-Wolfe algorithm is proposed to numerically\nsolve the problem off-the-grid, i.e., in continuous 3D space. Simulated\nexperiments show that the approach achieves near-exact recovery of hundreds of\nimage sources using an arbitrarily placed compact 32-channel spherical\nmicrophone array in random rectangular rooms. The impact of noise, sampling\nrate and array diameter on these results is also examined.",

    "abstract": "Human pose forecasting is a challenging problem involving complex human body\nmotion and posture dynamics. In cases that there are multiple people in the\nenvironment, one's motion may also be influenced by the motion and dynamic\nmovements of others. Although there are several previous works targeting the\nproblem of multi-person dynamic pose forecasting, they often model the entire\npose sequence as time series (ignoring the underlying relationship between\njoints) or only output the future pose sequence of one person at a time. In\nthis paper, we present a new method, called Social Motion Transformer\n(SoMoFormer), for multi-person 3D pose forecasting. Our transformer\narchitecture uniquely models human motion input as a joint sequence rather than\na time sequence, allowing us to perform attention over joints while predicting\nan entire future motion sequence for each joint in parallel. We show that with\nthis problem reformulation, SoMoFormer naturally extends to multi-person scenes\nby using the joints of all people in a scene as input queries. Using learned\nembeddings to denote the type of joint, person identity, and global position,\nour model learns the relationships between joints and between people, attending\nmore strongly to joints from the same or nearby people. SoMoFormer outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods for long-term motion prediction on the SoMoF benchmark\nas well as the CMU-Mocap and MuPoTS-3D datasets.

    "abstract": "Perceiving the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the spacecraft is a\nprerequisite for successfully executing many on-orbit space missions, and it\ncan provide critical input for many downstream vision algorithms. In this\npaper, we propose to sense the 3D structure of spacecraft using light detection\nand ranging sensor (LIDAR) and a monocular camera. To this end, Spacecraft\nDepth Completion Network (SDCNet) is proposed to recover the dense depth map\nbased on gray image and sparse depth map. Specifically, SDCNet decomposes the\nobject-level spacecraft depth completion task into foreground segmentation\nsubtask and foreground depth completion subtask, which segments the spacecraft\nregion first and then performs depth completion on the segmented foreground\narea. In this way, the background interference to foreground spacecraft depth\ncompletion is effectively avoided. Moreover, an attention-based feature fusion\nmodule is also proposed to aggregate the complementary information between\ndifferent inputs, which deduces the correlation between different features\nalong the channel and the spatial dimension sequentially. Besides, four metrics\nare also proposed to evaluate object-level depth completion performance, which\ncan more intuitively reflect the quality of spacecraft depth completion\nresults. Finally, a large-scale satellite depth completion dataset is\nconstructed for training and testing spacecraft depth completion algorithms.\nEmpirical experiments on the dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed SDCNet, which achieves 0.25m mean absolute error of interest and\n0.759m mean absolute truncation error, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a\nlarge margin. The spacecraft pose estimation experiment is also conducted based\non the depth completion results, and the experimental results indicate that the\npredicted dense depth map could meet the needs of downstream vision tasks.",

    "abstract": "Machine ethics has received increasing attention over the past few years\nbecause of the need to ensure safe and reliable artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe two dominantly used theories in machine ethics are deontological and\nutilitarian ethics. Virtue ethics, on the other hand, has often been mentioned\nas an alternative ethical theory. While this interesting approach has certain\nadvantages over popular ethical theories, little effort has been put into\nengineering artificial virtuous agents due to challenges in their\nformalization, codifiability, and the resolution of ethical dilemmas to train\nvirtuous agents. We propose to bridge this gap by using role-playing games\nriddled with moral dilemmas. There are several such games in existence, such as\nPapers, Please and Life is Strange, where the main character encounters\nsituations where they must choose the right course of action by giving up\nsomething else dear to them. We draw inspiration from such games to show how a\nsystemic role-playing game can be designed to develop virtues within an\nartificial agent. Using modern day AI techniques, such as affinity-based\nreinforcement learning and explainable AI, we motivate the implementation of\nvirtuous agents that play such role-playing games, and the examination of their\ndecisions through a virtue ethical lens. The development of such agents and\nenvironments is a first step towards practically formalizing and demonstrating\nthe value of virtue ethics in the development of ethical agents.",

    "abstract": "Opinion dynamics on social networks have been received considerable\nattentions in recent years. Nevertheless, just a few works have theoretically\nanalyzed the condition in which a certain opinion can spread in the whole\nstructured population. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game approach\nfor a binary opinion model to explore the conditions for an opinion's\nspreading. Inspired by real-life observations, we assume that an agent's choice\nto select an opinion is not random, but is based on a score rooted both from\npublic knowledge and the interactions with neighbors. By means of coalescing\nrandom walks, we obtain a condition in which opinion $A$ can be favored to\nspread on social networks in the weak selection limit. We find that the\nsuccessfully spreading condition of opinion $A$ is closely related to the basic\nscores of binary opinions, the feedback scores on opinion interactions, and the\nstructural parameters including the edge weights, the weighted degrees of\nvertices, and the average degree of the network. In particular, when\nindividuals adjust their opinions based solely on the public information, the\nvitality of opinion $A$ depends exclusively on the difference of basic scores\nof $A$ and $B$. When there are no negative (positive) feedback interactions\nbetween connected individuals, we find that the success of opinion $A$ depends\non the ratio of the obtained positive (negative) feedback scores of competing\nopinions. To complete our study, we perform computer simulations on\nfully-connected, small-world, and scale-free networks, respectively, which\nsupport and confirm our theoretical findings.",

    "title": "Attack detection based on machine learning algorithms for different  variants of Spectre attacks and different Meltdown attack implementations",
    "abstract": "To improve the overall performance of processors, computer architects use\nvarious performance optimization techniques in modern processors, such as\nspeculative execution, branch prediction, and chaotic execution. Both now and\nin the future, these optimization techniques are critical for improving the\nexecution speed of processor instructions. However, researchers have discovered\nthat these techniques introduce hidden inherent security flaws, such as\nmeltdown and ghost attacks in recent years. They exploit techniques such as\nchaotic execution or speculative execution combined with cache-based\nside-channel attacks to leak protected data. The impact of these\nvulnerabilities is enormous because they are prevalent in existing or future\nprocessors. However, until today, meltdown and ghost have not been effectively\naddressed, but instead, multiple attack variants and different attack\nimplementations have evolved from them. This paper proposes to optimize four\ndifferent hardware performance events through feature selection and use machine\nlearning algorithms to build a real-time detection mechanism for Spectre\nv1,v2,v4, and different implementations of meltdown attacks, ultimately\nachieving an accuracy rate of over 99\\%. In order to verify the practicality of\nthe attack detection model, this paper is tested with a variety of benign\nprograms and different implementations of Spectre attacks different from the\nmodeling process, and the absolute accuracy also exceeds 99\\%, showing that\nthis paper can cope with different attack variants and different\nimplementations of the same attack that may occur daily.",

    "abstract": "The chips contained in any electronic device are manufactured over circular\nsilicon wafers, which are monitored by inspection machines at different\nproduction stages. Inspection machines detect and locate any defect within the\nwafer and return a Wafer Defect Map (WDM), i.e., a list of the coordinates\nwhere defects lie, which can be considered a huge, sparse, and binary image. In\nnormal conditions, wafers exhibit a small number of randomly distributed\ndefects, while defects grouped in specific patterns might indicate known or\nnovel categories of failures in the production line. Needless to say, a primary\nconcern of semiconductor industries is to identify these patterns and intervene\nas soon as possible to restore normal production conditions.\nHere we address WDM monitoring as an open-set recognition problem to\naccurately classify WDM in known categories and promptly detect novel patterns.\nIn particular, we propose a comprehensive pipeline for wafer monitoring based\non a Submanifold Sparse Convolutional Network, a deep architecture designed to\nprocess sparse data at an arbitrary resolution, which is trained on the known\nclasses. To detect novelties, we define an outlier detector based on a Gaussian\nMixture Model fitted on the latent representation of the classifier. Our\nexperiments on a real dataset of WDMs show that directly processing\nfull-resolution WDMs by Submanifold Sparse Convolutions yields superior\nclassification performance on known classes than traditional Convolutional\nNeural Networks, which require a preliminary binning to reduce the size of the\nbinary images representing WDMs. Moreover, our solution outperforms\nstate-of-the-art open-set recognition solutions in detecting novelties.",

    "abstract": "Representation learning on temporal graphs has drawn considerable research\nattention owing to its fundamental importance in a wide spectrum of real-world\napplications. Though a number of studies succeed in obtaining time-dependent\nrepresentations, it still faces significant challenges. On the one hand, most\nof the existing methods restrict the embedding space with a certain curvature.\nHowever, the underlying geometry in fact shifts among the positive curvature\nhyperspherical, zero curvature Euclidean and negative curvature hyperbolic\nspaces in the evolvement over time. On the other hand, these methods usually\nrequire abundant labels to learn temporal representations, and thereby notably\nlimit their wide use in the unlabeled graphs of the real applications. To\nbridge this gap, we make the first attempt to study the problem of\nself-supervised temporal graph representation learning in the general\nRiemannian space, supporting the time-varying curvature to shift among\nhyperspherical, Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces. In this paper, we present a\nnovel self-supervised Riemannian graph neural network (SelfRGNN). Specifically,\nwe design a curvature-varying Riemannian GNN with a theoretically grounded time\nencoding, and formulate a functional curvature over time to model the\nevolvement shifting among the positive, zero and negative curvature spaces. To\nenable the self-supervised learning, we propose a novel reweighting\nself-contrastive approach, exploring the Riemannian space itself without\naugmentation, and propose an edge-based self-supervised curvature learning with\nthe Ricci curvature. Extensive experiments show the superiority of SelfRGNN,\nand moreover, the case study shows the time-varying curvature of temporal graph\nin reality.",

Moreover, many practical scenarios suffer\nfrom partial observability issues, e.g., due to sensing noise or hidden\ncorrelation.

    "abstract": "Point cloud is one of the most widely used digital representation formats for\n3D contents, the visual quality of which may suffer from noise and geometric\nshift during the production procedure as well as compression and downsampling\nduring the transmission process. To tackle the challenge of point cloud quality\nassessment (PCQA), many PCQA methods have been proposed to evaluate the visual\nquality levels of point clouds by assessing the rendered static 2D projections.\nAlthough such projection-based PCQA methods achieve competitive performance\nwith the assistance of mature image quality assessment (IQA) methods, they\nneglect the dynamic quality-aware information, which does not fully match the\nfact that observers tend to perceive the point clouds through both static and\ndynamic views. Therefore, in this paper, we treat the point clouds as moving\ncamera videos and explore the way of dealing with PCQA tasks via using video\nquality assessment (VQA) methods in a no-reference (NR) manner. First, we\ngenerate the captured videos by rotating the camera around the point clouds\nthrough four circular pathways. Then we extract both spatial and temporal\nquality-aware features from the selected key frames and the video clips by\nusing trainable 2D-CNN and pre-trained 3D-CNN models respectively. Finally, the\nvisual quality of point clouds is represented by the regressed video quality\nvalues. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method is effective\nfor predicting the visual quality levels of the point clouds and even\ncompetitive with full-reference (FR) PCQA methods. The ablation studies further\nverify the rationality of the proposed framework and confirm the contributions\nmade by the quality-aware features extracted from dynamic views.",

Super-model paradigms help reduce computational and data cost and\ncarbon emission, which is critical to AI industry, especially enormous small\nand medium-sized enterprises. We model the super-model paradigm as a two-stage\ndiffusion process: (1) in the pre-training stage, the model parameter diffuses\nfrom random initials and converges to a steady distribution; and (2) in the\nfine-tuning stage, the model parameter is transported to another steady\ndistribution. Both training stages can be mathematically modeled by the\nUhlenbeck-Ornstein process which converges to two Maxwell-Boltzmann\ndistributions, respectively, each of which characterizes the corresponding\nconvergent model. An $\\mathcal O(1/\\sqrt{N})$ generalization bound is then\nestablished via PAC-Bayesian framework. The theory finds that the\ngeneralization error of the fine-tuning stage is dominant in domain adaptation.\nIn addition, our theory suggests that the generalization is determined by a new\nmeasure that characterizes the domain discrepancy between the source domain and\ntarget domain, based on the covariance matrices and the shift of the converged\nlocal minimum.",

    "abstract": "Activation functions can have a significant impact on reducing the\ntopological complexity of input data and therefore improve the performance of\nthe model. Selecting a suitable activation function is an essential step in\nneural model design. However, the choice of activation function is seldom\ndiscussed or explored in Transformer-based language models. Their activation\nfunctions are chosen beforehand and then remain fixed from pre-training to\nfine-tuning. As a result, the inductive biases they imposed on models cannot be\nadjusted during this long life cycle. Moreover, subsequently developed models\n(e.g., RoBERTa, BART, and GPT-3) often follow up prior work (e.g., BERT) to use\nthe same activation function without justification. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the effectiveness of using Rational Activation Function (RAF), a\nlearnable activation function, in the Transformer architecture. In contrast to\nconventional, predefined activation functions, RAFs can adaptively learn\noptimal activation functions during training according to input data. Our\nexperiments show the RAF-based Transformer (RAFT) achieves a lower validation\nperplexity than a vanilla BERT with the GELU function. We further evaluate RAFT\non downstream tasks in low- and full-data settings. Our results show that RAFT\noutperforms the counterpart model across the majority of tasks and settings.\nFor instance, RAFT outperforms vanilla BERT on the GLUE benchmark by 5.71\npoints on average in low-data scenario (where 100 training examples are\navailable) and by 2.05 points on SQuAD in full-data setting. Analysis of the\nshapes of learned RAFs further unveils that they substantially vary between\ndifferent layers of the pre-trained model and mostly look very different from\nconventional activation functions.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, we are living in an era of extreme device heterogeneity. Despite\nthe high variety of conventional CPU architectures, accelerator devices, such\nas GPUs and FPGAs, also appear in the foreground exploding the pool of\navailable solutions to execute applications. However, choosing the appropriate\ndevice per application needs is an extremely challenging task due to the\nabstract relationship between hardware and software. Automatic optimization\nalgorithms that are accurate are required to cope with the complexity and\nvariety of current hardware and software. Optimal execution has always relied\non time-consuming trial and error approaches. Machine learning (ML) and Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) has flourished over the last decade with research\nfocusing on deep architectures. In this context, the use of natural language\nprocessing techniques to source code in order to conduct autotuning tasks is an\nemerging field of study. In this paper, we extend the work of Cummins et al.,\nnamely Deeptune, that tackles the problem of optimal device selection (CPU or\nGPU) for accelerated OpenCL kernels. We identify three major limitations of\nDeeptune and, based on these, we propose four different DNN models that provide\nenhanced contextual information of source codes. Experimental results show that\nour proposed methodology surpasses that of Cummins et al. work, providing up to\n4\\% improvement in prediction accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models are a class of generative models, showing superior\nperformance as compared to other generative models in creating realistic images\nwhen trained on natural image datasets. We introduce DISPR, a diffusion-based\nmodel for solving the inverse problem of three-dimensional (3D) cell shape\nprediction from two-dimensional (2D) single cell microscopy images. Using the\n2D microscopy image as a prior, DISPR is conditioned to predict realistic 3D\nshape reconstructions. To showcase the applicability of DISPR as a data\naugmentation tool in a feature-based single cell classification task, we\nextract morphological features from the cells grouped into six highly\nimbalanced classes. Adding features from predictions of DISPR to the three\nminority classes improved the macro F1 score from $F1_\\text{macro} = 55.2 \\pm\n4.6\\%$ to $F1_\\text{macro} = 72.2 \\pm 4.9\\%$.

This paper proposes the capsulation attack,\nan efficient method that can invalidate most established backdoor-based\nwatermarking schemes without sacrificing the pirated model's functionality. By\nencapsulating the deep neural network with a rule-based or Bayes filter, an\nadversary can block ownership probing and reject the ownership verification. We\npropose a metric, CAScore, to measure a backdoor-based watermarking scheme's\nsecurity against the capsulation attack.

In this context, the mathematical concept of age of information\nis often used to capture the freshness of received data.

Most investigations on the subject\nassume that the transmitter can leverage knowledge of the age of information at\nthe receiver side to decide when to send data, even when the communication\nchannel is unreliable. In reality, tracking the outcome of the updates would\nrequire additional consumption of resources to acquire a feedback. We\ninvestigate the optimal schedule of updates over a finite time horizon for a\nresource-constrained sensor that is allowed to perform a limited number of\nupdates, as typical of IoT devices. We discuss the role of the feedback from\nthe receiver, and whether it is convenient to ask for it whenever this causes\nadditional energy consumption and consequently allows the transmission of a\nlower number of updates.

The task is to find a hitting set\nfor $\\mathcal{F}$ that minimizes the maximum number of elements in any of the\nsets of $\\mathcal{B}$. Our focus is on determining the complexity of some\nspecial cases of Sparse-HS with respect to the sparseness $k$, which is the\noptimum number of hitting set elements in any set of $\\mathcal{B}$.\nFor the Sparse Vertex Cover (Sparse-VC) problem, $V$ is given by the vertex\nset of a graph, and $\\mathcal{F}$ is its edge set. We prove NP-hardness for\nsparseness $k\\geq 2$ and polynomial time solvability for $k=1$. We also provide\na polynomial-time $2$-approximation for any $k$. A special case of Sparse-VC is\nFair Vertex Cover (Fair-VC), where the family $\\mathcal{B}$ is given by vertex\nneighbourhoods. For this problem we prove NP-hardness for constant $k$ and\nprovide a polynomial-time $(2-\\frac{1}{k})$-approximation. This is better than\nany approximation possible for Sparse-VC or Vertex Cover (under UGC).\nWe then consider two problems derived from Sparse-HS related to the highway\ndimension, a graph parameter modelling transportation networks. Most algorithms\nfor graphs of low highway dimension compute solutions to the $r$-Shortest Path\nCover ($r$-SPC) problem, where $r>0$, $\\mathcal{F}$ contains all shortest paths\nof length between $r$ and $2r$, and $\\mathcal{B}$ contains all balls of radius\n$2r$.

    "abstract": "Deep generative models (DGMs) are data-eager. Essentially, it is because\nlearning a complex model on limited data suffers from a large variance and\neasily overfits. Inspired by the \\emph{bias-variance dilemma}, we propose\n\\emph{regularized deep generative model} (Reg-DGM), which leverages a\nnontransferable pre-trained model to reduce the variance of generative modeling\nwith limited data. Formally, Reg-DGM optimizes a weighted sum of a certain\ndivergence between the data distribution and the DGM and the expectation of an\nenergy function defined by the pre-trained model w.r.t. the DGM. Theoretically,\nwe characterize the existence and uniqueness of the global minimum of Reg-DGM\nin the nonparametric setting and rigorously prove the statistical benefits of\nReg-DGM w.r.t. the mean squared error and the expected risk in a simple yet\nrepresentative Gaussian-fitting example. Empirically, it is quite flexible to\nspecify the DGM and the pre-trained model in Reg-DGM. In particular, with a\nResNet-18 classifier pre-trained on ImageNet and a data-dependent energy\nfunction, Reg-DGM consistently improves the generation performance of strong\nDGMs including StyleGAN2 and ADA on several benchmarks with limited data and\nachieves competitive results to the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "As machine learning (ML) models are increasingly being deployed in\nhigh-stakes applications, policymakers have suggested tighter data protection\nregulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). One key principle is the ``right to be\nforgotten'' which gives users the right to have their data deleted. Another key\nprinciple is the right to an actionable explanation, also known as algorithmic\nrecourse, allowing users to reverse unfavorable decisions. To date it is\nunknown whether these two principles can be operationalized simultaneously.\nTherefore, we introduce and study the problem of recourse invalidation in the\ncontext of data deletion requests. More specifically, we theoretically and\nempirically analyze the behavior of popular state-of-the-art algorithms and\ndemonstrate that the recourses generated by these algorithms are likely to be\ninvalidated if a small number of data deletion requests (e.g., 1 or 2) warrant\nupdates of the predictive model. For the setting of linear models and\noverparameterized neural networks -- studied through the lens of neural tangent\nkernels (NTKs) -- we suggest a framework to identify a minimal subset of\ncritical training points, which when removed, would lead to maximize the\nfraction of invalidated recourses. Using our framework, we empirically\nestablish that the removal of as little as 2 data instances from the training\nset can invalidate up to 95 percent of all recourses output by popular\nstate-of-the-art algorithms. Thus, our work raises fundamental questions about\nthe compatibility of ``the right to an actionable explanation'' in the context\nof the ``right to be forgotten''.",

The research findings may contribute to the design of\neducational activities dedicated to shaping the pro-environmental behavior of\ncity dwellers.",

    "abstract": "Causal representation learning exposes latent high-level causal variables\nbehind low-level observations, which has enormous potential for a set of\ndownstream tasks of interest. Despite this, identifying the true latent causal\nrepresentation from observed data is a great challenge. In this work we focus\non identifying latent causal variables. To this end, we analysis three\nintrinsic properties in latent space, including transitivity, permutation and\nscaling. We show that the transitivity severely hinders the identifiability of\nlatent causal variables, while permutation and scaling guide the direction of\nidentifying latent causal variable. To break the transitivity, we assume the\nunderlying latent causal relations to be linear Gaussian models, in which the\nweights, mean and variance of Gaussian noise are modulated by an additionally\nobserved variable. Under these assumptions we theoretically show that the\nlatent causal variables can be identifiable up to trivial permutation and\nscaling. Built on this theoretical result, we propose a novel method, termed\nStructural caUsAl Variational autoEncoder, which directly learns latent causal\nvariables, together with the mapping from the latent causal variables to the\nobserved ones. Experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the\nidentifiable result and the ability of the proposed method for learning latent\ncausal variables.",

Although using multi-scale patches to encode the geometry of\na point has become the common wisdom in PCD, we find that simple aggregation of\nextracted multi-scale features can not adaptively utilize the appropriate scale\ninformation according to the geometric information around noisy points. It\nleads to surface degradation, especially for points close to edges and points\non complex curved surfaces. We raise an intriguing question -- if employing\nmulti-scale geometric perception information to guide the network to utilize\nmulti-scale information, can eliminate the severe surface degradation problem?\nTo answer it, we propose a Multi-offset Denoising Network (MODNet) customized\nfor multi-scale patches. First, we extract the low-level feature of three\nscales patches by patch feature encoders. Second, a multi-scale perception\nmodule is designed to embed multi-scale geometric information for each scale\nfeature and regress multi-scale weights to guide a multi-offset denoising\ndisplacement. Third, a multi-offset decoder regresses three scale offsets,\nwhich are guided by the multi-scale weights to predict the final displacement\nby weighting them adaptively.

    "abstract": "Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) learns to predict the labels in target\ndomain data, under the setting where all data from multiple source domains are\nlabelled and the data from the target domain are unlabeled. To handle this\nproblem, most of methods focus on learning invariant representations across\ndomains. However, their success severely relies on the assumption that label\ndistribution remains unchanged across domains. To mitigate it, we propose a new\nassumption, latent covariate shift, where the marginal distribution of the\nlatent content variable changes across domains, and the conditional\ndistribution of the label given the latent content remains invariant across\ndomains. We introduce a latent style variable to complement the latent content\nvariable forming a latent causal graph as the data and label generating\nprocess. We show that although the latent style variable is unidentifiable due\nto transitivity property in the latent space, the latent content variable can\nbe identified up to simple scaling under some mild conditions. This motivates\nus to propose a novel method for MSDA, which learns the invariant label\ndistribution conditional on the latent content variable, instead of learning\ninvariant representations.

To\nguarantee real ownership of these digital objects, open systems based on public\nblockchains and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are emerging together with a nascent\ndecentralized and open creator economy. To manage this emerging economy in a\nmore organised way, and fight the so common NFT plagiarism, we propose\nCopyrightLY, a decentralized application for authorship and copyright\nmanagement. It provides means to claim content authorship, including supporting\nevidence. Content and metadata are stored in decentralized storage and\nregistered on the blockchain.

The tokenomics include the\nresolution of complaints and enabling the monetization of curated claims.\nMonetization is achieved through licensing NFTs with metadata enhanced by\nsemantic technologies. Semantic data makes explicit the reuse conditions\ntransferred with the token while keeping the connection to the underlying\ncopyright claims to improve the trustability of the NFTs. Moreover, the\nsemantic metadata is flexible enough to enable licensing not just in the real\nworld.

'Algorithmic recourse' offers\nfeasible recovery actions to change unwanted outcomes through the modification\nof attributes. We introduce the notion of ranked group-level recourse fairness,\nand develop a 'recourse-aware ranking' solution that satisfies ranked recourse\nfairness constraints while minimizing the cost of suggested modifications. Our\nsolution suggests interventions that can reorder the ranked list of database\nrecords and mitigate group-level unfairness; specifically, disproportionate\nrepresentation of sub-groups and recourse cost imbalance. This re-ranking\nidentifies the minimum modifications to data points, with these attribute\nmodifications weighted according to their ease of recourse. We then present an\nefficient block-based extension that enables re-ranking at any granularity\n(e.g., multiple brackets of bank loan interest rates, multiple pages of search\nengine results). Evaluation on real datasets shows that, while existing methods\nmay even exacerbate recourse unfairness, our solution -- RAGUEL --\nsignificantly improves recourse-aware fairness.

    "abstract": "As an emerging technology in the era of Industry 4.0, digital twin is gaining\nunprecedented attention because of its promise to further optimize process\ndesign, quality control, health monitoring, decision and policy making, and\nmore, by comprehensively modeling the physical world as a group of\ninterconnected digital models. In a two-part series of papers, we examine the\nfundamental role of different modeling techniques, twinning enabling\ntechnologies, and uncertainty quantification and optimization methods commonly\nused in digital twins. This first paper presents a thorough literature review\nof digital twin trends across many disciplines currently pursuing this area of\nresearch. Then, digital twin modeling and twinning enabling technologies are\nfurther analyzed by classifying them into two main categories:\nphysical-to-virtual, and virtual-to-physical, based on the direction in which\ndata flows. Finally, this paper provides perspectives on the trajectory of\ndigital twin technology over the next decade, and introduces a few emerging\nareas of research which will likely be of great use in future digital twin\nresearch. In part two of this review, the role of uncertainty quantification\nand optimization are discussed, a battery digital twin is demonstrated, and\nmore perspectives on the future of digital twin are shared.",

    "abstract": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) radars are emerging as valid alternatives to cameras\nfor the pervasive contactless monitoring of industrial environments, enabling\nvery tight human-machine interactions. However, commercial mmWave radars\nfeature a limited range (up to 6-8 m) and are subject to occlusion, which may\nconstitute a significant drawback in large industrial settings containing\nmachinery and obstacles. Thus, covering large indoor spaces requires multiple\nradars with known relative position and orientation. As a result, we\nnecessitate algorithms to combine their outputs. In this work, we present\nORACLE, an autonomous system that (i) integrates automatic relative position\nand orientation estimation from multiple radar devices by exploiting the\ntrajectories of people moving freely in the radars' common fields of view and\n(ii) fuses the tracking information from multiple radars to obtain a unified\ntracking among all sensors. Our implementation and experimental evaluation of\nORACLE results in median errors of 0.18 m and 2.86{\\deg} for radars location\nand orientation estimates, respectively. The fused tracking improves upon\nsingle sensor tracking by 6%, in terms of mean tracking accuracy, while\nreaching a mean tracking error as low as 0.14 m. Finally, ORACLE is robust to\nfusion relative time synchronization mismatches between -20% and +50%.",

To capture context at both global and\nlocal granularity, we propose ASpanFormer, a Transformer-based detector-free\nmatcher that is built on hierarchical attention structure, adopting a novel\nattention operation which is capable of adjusting attention span in a\nself-adaptive manner. To achieve this goal, first, flow maps are regressed in\neach cross attention phase to locate the center of search region. Next, a\nsampling grid is generated around the center, whose size, instead of being\nempirically configured as fixed, is adaptively computed from a pixel\nuncertainty estimated along with the flow map. Finally, attention is computed\nacross two images within derived regions, referred to as attention span. By\nthese means, we are able to not only maintain long-range dependencies, but also\nenable fine-grained attention among pixels of high relevance that compensates\nessential locality and piece-wise smoothness in matching tasks.\nState-of-the-art accuracy on a wide range of evaluation benchmarks validates\nthe strong matching capability of our method.",

    "abstract": "Inverse design, the process of matching a device or process parameters to\nexhibit a desired performance, is applied in many disciplines ranging from\nmaterial design over chemical processes and to engineering. Machine learning\nhas emerged as a promising approach to overcome current limitations imposed by\nthe dimensionality of the parameter space and multimodal parameter\ndistributions. Most traditional optimization routines assume an invertible\none-to-one mapping between the design parameters and the target performance.\nHowever, comparable or even identical performance may be realized by different\ndesigns, yielding a multimodal distribution of possible solutions to the\ninverse design problem which confuses the optimization algorithm. Here, we show\nhow a generative modeling approach based on invertible neural networks can\nprovide the full distribution of possible solutions to the inverse design\nproblem and resolve the ambiguity of nanodevice inverse design problems\nfeaturing multimodal distributions. We implement a Conditional Invertible\nNeural Network (cINN) and apply it to a proof-of-principle nanophotonic\nproblem, consisting in tailoring the transmission spectrum of a metallic film\nmilled by subwavelength indentations. We compare our approach with the commonly\nused conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE) framework and show the superior\nflexibility and accuracy of the proposed cINNs when dealing with multimodal\ndevice distributions.

To facilitate rigorous analysis, we first develop a\nnovel spatial model for this setup by modeling nanomachines as a Poisson\ncluster process with the fusion centers forming its parent point process. For\nthis setup, we first derive a new set of distance distributions in the\nthree-dimensional space, resulting in a remarkably simple result for the\nspecial case of the Thomas cluster process.

The\ninfluence of these models on the estimation of clinically relevant biomarkers\nused to assess the degree of severity of the pathological condition (pressure\ndifference, secondary flow degree, normalized flow displacement, wall shear\nstress) is investigated in detail.

The numerical results indicate that second order velocity\nelements outperform first order elements in terms of accuracy.

    "abstract": "Node similarity scores constitute a foundation for machine learning in\ngraphs. Besides clustering, node classification, and anomaly detection, they\nare a basis for link prediction with critical applications in biological\nsystems, information networks, and recommender systems. Recent works on link\nprediction use vector space embeddings to calculate node similarities. While\nthese methods can provide good performance in undirected networks, they have\nseveral disadvantages: limited interpretability, problem-specific\nhyperparameter tuning, manual model fitting through dimensionality reduction,\nand poor performance of symmetric similarities in directed link prediction. To\naddress these issues, we propose MapSim, a novel information-theoretic approach\nto assess node similarities based on modular compression of network flows.\nDifferent from vector space embeddings, MapSim represents nodes in a discrete,\nnon-metric space of communities and yields asymmetric similarities suitable to\npredict directed and undirected links in an unsupervised fashion. The resulting\nsimilarities can be explained based on a network's hierarchical modular\norganisation, facilitating interpretability. MapSim naturally accounts for\nOccam's razor, leading to parsimonious representations of clusters at multiple\nscales. Addressing unsupervised link prediction, we compare MapSim to popular\nembedding-based algorithms across 47 data sets of networks from a few hundred\nto hundreds of thousands of nodes and millions of links. Our analysis shows\nthat MapSim's average performance across all networks is more than 7% higher\nthan its closest competitor, outperforming all embedding methods in 14 of the\n47 networks, and a more than 33% better worst-case performance.

    "abstract": "Given a network property or a data structure, a local certification is a\nlabeling that allows to efficiently check that the property is satisfied, or\nthat the structure is correct. The quality of a certification is measured by\nthe size of its labels: the smaller, the better.This notion plays a central\nrole in self-stabilization, because the size of the certification is a lower\nbound (and often an upper bound) on the memory needed for silent\nself-stabilizing construction of distributed data structures. From the point of\nview of distributed computing in general, it is also a measure of the locality\nof a property (e.g. properties of the network itself, such as planarity).\nWhen it comes to the size of the certification labels, one can identify three\nimportant regimes: the properties for which the optimal size is polynomial in\nthe number of vertices of the graph, the ones that require only polylogarithmic\nsize, and the ones that can be certified with a constant number of bits. The\nfirst two regimes are well studied, with several upper and lower bounds,\nspecific techniques, and active research questions. On the other hand, the\nconstant regime has never been really explored, at least on the lower bound\nside. The main contribution of this paper is the first non-trivial lower bound\nfor this low regime. More precisely, we show that by using certification on\njust one bit (a binary certification), one cannot certify $k$-colorability for\n$k\\geq 3$. To do so, we develop a new technique, based on the notion of score,\nand both local symmetry arguments and a global parity argument. We hope that\nthis technique will be useful for establishing stronger results. We complement\nthis result by a discussion of the implication of lower bounds for this\nconstant-size regime, and with an upper bound for a related problem,\nillustrating that in some cases one can do better than the natural upper bound.",

    "title": "A Generic Algorithm for Top-K On-Shelf Utility Mining",
    "abstract": "On-shelf utility mining (OSUM) is an emerging research direction in data\nmining. It aims to discover itemsets that have high relative utility in their\nselling time period. Compared with traditional utility mining, OSUM can find\nmore practical and meaningful patterns in real-life applications. However,\nthere is a major drawback to traditional OSUM. For normal users, it is hard to\ndefine a minimum threshold minutil for mining the right amount of on-shelf high\nutility itemsets. On one hand, if the threshold is set too high, the number of\npatterns would not be enough. On the other hand, if the threshold is set too\nlow, too many patterns will be discovered and cause an unnecessary waste of\ntime and memory consumption. To address this issue, the user usually directly\nspecifies a parameter k, where only the top-k high relative utility itemsets\nwould be considered. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a generic algorithm\nnamed TOIT for mining Top-k On-shelf hIgh-utility paTterns to solve this\nproblem. TOIT applies a novel strategy to raise the minutil based on the\non-shelf datasets. Besides, two novel upper-bound strategies named subtree\nutility and local utility are applied to prune the search space. By adopting\nthe strategies mentioned above, the TOIT algorithm can narrow the search space\nas early as possible, improve the mining efficiency, and reduce the memory\nconsumption, so it can obtain better performance than other algorithms. A\nseries of experiments have been conducted on real datasets with different\nstyles to compare the effects with the state-of-the-art KOSHU algorithm. The\nexperimental results showed that TOIT outperforms KOSHU in both running time\nand memory consumption.",

Owing\nto the continuous and bijective characteristics of NODEs, in addition, we\ndesign a one-shot price optimization method given a pre-trained prediction\nmodel, which requires only one iteration to find the optimal solution. In other\nwords, we optimize the price input to the pre-trained prediction model to\nachieve targeted occupancy rates in the parking blocks. We conduct experiments\nwith the data collected in San Francisco and Seattle for years. Our prediction\nmodel shows the best accuracy in comparison with various temporal or\nspatio-temporal forecasting models. Our one-shot optimization method greatly\noutperforms other black-box and white-box search methods in terms of the search\ntime and always returns the optimal price solution.",

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting is an important problem, with many real world\napplications. Ensembles of deep neural networks have recently achieved\nimpressive forecasting accuracy, but such large ensembles are impractical in\nmany real world settings. Transformer models been successfully applied to a\ndiverse set of challenging problems. We propose a novel adaptation of the\noriginal Transformer architecture focusing on the task of time series\nforecasting, called Persistence Initialization. The model is initialized as a\nnaive persistence model by using a multiplicative gating mechanism combined\nwith a residual skip connection. We use a decoder Transformer with ReZero\nnormalization and Rotary positional encodings, but the adaptation is applicable\nto any auto-regressive neural network model. We evaluate our proposed\narchitecture on the challenging M4 dataset, achieving competitive performance\ncompared to ensemble based methods. We also compare against existing recently\nproposed Transformer models for time series forecasting, showing superior\nperformance on the M4 dataset. Extensive ablation studies show that Persistence\nInitialization leads to better performance and faster convergence. As the size\nof the model increases, only the models with our proposed adaptation gain in\nperformance. We also perform an additional ablation study to determine the\nimportance of the choice of normalization and positional encoding, and find\nboth the use of Rotary encodings and ReZero normalization to be essential for\ngood forecasting performance.",

    "abstract": "Night-Time Scene Parsing (NTSP) is essential to many vision applications,\nespecially for autonomous driving. Most of the existing methods are proposed\nfor day-time scene parsing. They rely on modeling pixel intensity-based spatial\ncontextual cues under even illumination. Hence, these methods do not perform\nwell in night-time scenes as such spatial contextual cues are buried in the\nover-/under-exposed regions in night-time scenes. In this paper, we first\nconduct an image frequency-based statistical experiment to interpret the\nday-time and night-time scene discrepancies. We find that image frequency\ndistributions differ significantly between day-time and night-time scenes, and\nunderstanding such frequency distributions is critical to NTSP problem. Based\non this, we propose to exploit the image frequency distributions for night-time\nscene parsing. First, we propose a Learnable Frequency Encoder (LFE) to model\nthe relationship between different frequency coefficients to measure all\nfrequency components dynamically. Second, we propose a Spatial Frequency Fusion\nmodule (SFF) that fuses both spatial and frequency information to guide the\nextraction of spatial context features. Extensive experiments show that our\nmethod performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on the\nNightCity, NightCity+ and BDD100K-night datasets.

Our results show that this fundamental exponents region is\nboosted compared to the region under maximum-rate constraints, and that it\ndepends on the permissible type-I error probabilities.

    "abstract": "It is often difficult to correctly infer a writer's emotion from text\nexchanged online, and differences in recognition between writers and readers\ncan be problematic. In this paper, we propose a new framework for detecting\nsentences that create differences in emotion recognition between the writer and\nthe reader and for detecting the kinds of expressions that cause such\ndifferences. The proposed framework consists of a bidirectional encoder\nrepresentations from transformers (BERT)-based detector that detects sentences\ncausing differences in emotion recognition and an analysis that acquires\nexpressions that characteristically appear in such sentences. The detector,\nbased on a Japanese SNS-document dataset with emotion labels annotated by both\nthe writer and three readers of the social networking service (SNS) documents,\ndetected \"hidden-anger sentences\" with AUC = 0.772; these sentences gave rise\nto differences in the recognition of anger. Because SNS documents contain many\nsentences whose meaning is extremely difficult to interpret, by analyzing the\nsentences detected by this detector, we obtained several expressions that\nappear characteristically in hidden-anger sentences. The detected sentences and\nexpressions do not convey anger explicitly, and it is difficult to infer the\nwriter's anger, but if the implicit anger is pointed out, it becomes possible\nto guess why the writer is angry. Put into practical use, this framework would\nlikely have the ability to mitigate problems based on misunderstandings.",

This problem of\nentity tracking is essential for language understanding, and thus, useful for a\nwide array of downstream applications in NLP such as question-answering,\nsummarization.\nIn this thesis, we focus on two key problems in relation to facilitating the\nuse of entity tracking models: (i) scaling entity tracking models to long\ndocuments, such as a novel, and (ii) integrating entity tracking into language\nmodels. Applying language technologies to long documents has garnered interest\nrecently, but computational constraints are a significant bottleneck in scaling\nup current methods. In this thesis, we argue that computationally efficient\nentity tracking models can be developed by representing entities with rich,\nfixed-dimensional vector representations derived from pretrained language\nmodels, and by exploiting the ephemeral nature of entities.

These maps are often advertised on a web\npage or pamphlet highlighting routes from source to destination stations. To\nvisually support such route-finding, designers often distort the layout by\nembedding symbolic shapes (e.g., circular routes) in order to guide readers'\nattention (e.g., Moscow map and Japan railway map). However, manually producing\nsuch maps is labor-intensive and the effect of shapes remains unclear.

In this mixed design, lines that are used to\napproximate the shapes are arranged symbolically, while the remaining lines\nfollow classical layout convention. A three-step algorithm, including (1)\ndetecting and selecting routes for shape approximation, (2) shape and layout\ndeformation, and (3) aligning lines on a grid, is integrated to guarantee good\nvisual quality. Our contribution lies in the definition of the mixed metro map\nproblem and the formulation of design criteria so that the problem can be\nresolved systematically using the optimization paradigm.

    "abstract": "Robot Operating System (ROS) has brought the excellent potential for\nautomation in various fields involving production tasks, productivity\nenhancement, and the simplification of human operations. However, ROS highly\nrelies on communication but lacks secure data sharing mechanisms. Securing\nconfidential data exchange between multi-robots presents significant challenges\nin multi-robot interactions. In this paper, we introduce AuthROS, a secure and\nconvenient authorization framework for ROS nodes with absolute security and\nhigh availability based on a private Ethereum network and SM algorithms. To our\nbest knowledge, AuthROS is the first secure data-sharing framework for robots\nloaded with ROS. This framework can meet the requirements for immutability and\nsecurity of confidential data exchanged between ROS nodes. In addition, an\nauthority-granting and identity-verification mechanism are proposed to execute\natomically to ensure trustworthy data exchange without third-party. Both an SM2\nkey exchange and an SM4 plaintext encryption mechanism are proposed for data\ntransmission security. A data digest uploading scheme is also implemented to\nimprove the efficiency of data querying and uploading on the Ethereum network.\nExperimental results demonstrate that it can generate a digest from 800KB\nencrypted data in 6.34ms.

    "abstract": "Although contemporary large language models (LMs) demonstrate impressive\nquestion-answering capabilities, their answers are typically the product of a\nsingle call to the model. This entails an unwelcome degree of opacity and\ncompromises performance, especially on problems that are inherently multi-step.\nTo address these limitations, we show how LMs can be made to perform faithful\nmulti-step reasoning via a process whose causal structure mirrors the\nunderlying logical structure of the problem. Our approach works by chaining\ntogether reasoning steps, where each step results from calls to two fine-tuned\nLMs, one for selection and one for inference, to produce a valid reasoning\ntrace. Our method carries out a beam search through the space of reasoning\ntraces to improve reasoning quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmodel on multi-step logical deduction and scientific question-answering,\nshowing that it outperforms baselines on final answer accuracy, and generates\nhumanly interpretable reasoning traces whose validity can be checked by the\nuser.",

    "abstract": "Air pollution (e.g., PM2.5) has a negative effect on human health. Recently,\nthe population-weighted annual mean PM2.5 concentration (PWAM) has been\nselected as an indicator 11.6.2 in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), for\nvarious countries to perfrom a long-term monitoring of population exposure to\nPM2.5 in cities. However, few studies have employed this indicator for a\ncity-level analysis and also in a long-time series (e.g., for decades). To fill\nthis research gap, this study investigates the long-term (2000-2020) variation\nof population exposure to PM2.5 in Eastern China (including 318\nprefecture-level cities). Three categories of open geospatial data (including\nhigh-resolution and long-term PM2.5 and population data, and administrative\nboundary data of cities) are involved for analysis. We found that: 1) A\nconsiderable decrease has been observed for the PWAM during 2014-2020. 2) In\n2020, the PWAM is for the first time lower than the interim target-1 (35\n{\\mu}g/m3) defined by the World Health Organization for 214 prefecture-level\ncities in Eastern China, which accounts for 67% of the total population.

    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are required to satisfy safety constraints in\nvarious application domains such as robotics, industrial manufacturing systems,\nand power systems. Faults and cyber attacks have been shown to cause safety\nviolations, which can damage the system and endanger human lives. Resilient\narchitectures have been proposed to ensure safety of CPS under such faults and\nattacks via methodologies including redundancy and restarting from safe\noperating conditions. The existing resilient architectures for CPS utilize\ndifferent mechanisms to guarantee safety, and currently there is no approach to\ncompare them. Moreover, the analysis and design undertaken for CPS employing\none architecture is not readily extendable to another. In this paper, we\npropose a timing-based framework for CPS employing various resilient\narchitectures and develop a common methodology for safety analysis and\ncomputation of control policies and design parameters. Using the insight that\nthe cyber subsystem operates in one out of a finite number of statuses, we\nfirst develop a hybrid system model that captures CPS adopting any of these\narchitectures. Based on the hybrid system, we formulate the problem of joint\ncomputation of control policies and associated timing parameters for CPS to\nsatisfy a given safety constraint and derive sufficient conditions for the\nsolution. Utilizing the derived conditions, we provide an algorithm to compute\ncontrol policies and timing parameters relevant to the employed architecture.\nWe also note that our solution can be applied to a wide class of CPS with\npolynomial dynamics and also allows incorporation of new architectures. We\nverify our proposed framework by performing a case study on adaptive cruise\ncontrol of vehicles.",

    "abstract": "Quantization is a technique to reduce the computation and memory cost of DNN\nmodels, which are getting increasingly large. Existing quantization solutions\nuse fixed-point integer or floating-point types, which have limited benefits,\nas both require more bits to maintain the accuracy of original models. On the\nother hand, variable-length quantization uses low-bit quantization for normal\nvalues and high-precision for a fraction of outlier values. Even though this\nline of work brings algorithmic benefits, it also introduces significant\nhardware overheads due to variable-length encoding and decoding.\nIn this work, we propose a fixed-length adaptive numerical data type called\nANT to achieve low-bit quantization with tiny hardware overheads. Our data type\nANT leverages two key innovations to exploit the intra-tensor and inter-tensor\nadaptive opportunities in DNN models. First, we propose a particular data type,\nflint, that combines the advantages of float and int for adapting to the\nimportance of different values within a tensor. Second, we propose an adaptive\nframework that selects the best type for each tensor according to its\ndistribution characteristics. We design a unified processing element\narchitecture for ANT and show its ease of integration with existing DNN\naccelerators.

Prefix DCJs cut the leftmost segment of a genome and any other\nsegment, and recombine the severed endpoints in one of two possible ways: one\nof these options corresponds to a prefix reversal, which reverses the order of\nelements between the two cuts (as well as their signs in the signed case).\nDepending on whether we consider both options or reversals only, our main\nresults are:\n(1) new structural lower bounds based on the breakpoint graph for sorting by\nunsigned prefix reversals, unsigned prefix DCJs, or signed prefix DCJs;\n(2) a polynomial-time algorithm for sorting by signed prefix DCJs, thus\nanswering an open question in [8];\n(3) a 3/2-approximation for sorting by unsigned prefix DCJs, which is, to the\nbest of our knowledge, the first sorting by {\\em prefix} rearrangements problem\nthat admits an approximation ratio strictly smaller than 2 (with the obvious\nexception of the polynomial-time solvable problems); and finally,\n(4) an FPT algorithm for sorting by unsigned prefix DCJs parameterised by the\nnumber of breakpoints in the genome.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in the development of a fully automated vehicle is to\nenable a large variety of users to use the vehicle independently and safely.\nParticular demands arise from user groups who rely on human assistance when\nusing conventional cars. For the independent use of a vehicle by such groups,\nthe vehicle must compensate for the absence of an accompanying person, whose\nactions and decisions ensure the accompanied person's safety even in unknown\nsituations. The resulting requirements cannot be fulfilled only by the\ngeometric design of the vehicle and the nature of its control elements. Special\nuser needs must be taken into account in the entire automation of the vehicle.\nIn this paper, we describe requirements for compensating for the absence of an\naccompanying person and show how required functions can be located in a\nhierarchical functional system architecture of an automated vehicle.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have gained prominence for their ability to learn\nrepresentations for uni-relational facts. Recently, research has focused on\nmodeling hyper-relational facts, which move beyond the restriction of\nuni-relational facts and allow us to represent more complex and real-world\ninformation. However, existing approaches for learning representations on\nhyper-relational KGs majorly focus on enhancing the communication from\nqualifiers to base triples while overlooking the flow of information from base\ntriple to qualifiers. This can lead to suboptimal qualifier representations,\nespecially when a large amount of qualifiers are presented. It motivates us to\ndesign a framework that utilizes multiple aggregators to learn representations\nfor hyper-relational facts: one from the perspective of the base triple and the\nother one from the perspective of the qualifiers. Experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework for hyper-relational knowledge graph completion\nacross multiple datasets. Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study that\nvalidates the importance of the various components in our framework.

    "abstract": "As an important biomarker for human identification, human gait can be\ncollected at a distance by passive sensors without subject cooperation, which\nplays an essential role in crime prevention, security detection and other human\nidentification applications. At present, most research works are based on\ncameras and computer vision techniques to perform gait recognition. However,\nvision-based methods are not reliable when confronting poor illuminations,\nleading to degrading performances. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal\ngait recognition method, namely GaitFi, which leverages WiFi signals and videos\nfor human identification. In GaitFi, Channel State Information (CSI) that\nreflects the multi-path propagation of WiFi is collected to capture human\ngaits, while videos are captured by cameras. To learn robust gait information,\nwe propose a Lightweight Residual Convolution Network (LRCN) as the backbone\nnetwork, and further propose the two-stream GaitFi by integrating WiFi and\nvision features for the gait retrieval task. The GaitFi is trained by the\ntriplet loss and classification loss on different levels of features. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted in the real world, which demonstrates that the GaitFi\noutperforms state-of-the-art gait recognition methods based on single WiFi or\ncamera, achieving 94.2% for human identification tasks of 12 subjects.",

However, collecting large-scale\ntask-specific unannotated data at scale can be challenging for individual labs.\nExisting online resources, such as digital books, publications, and search\nengines, provide a new resource for obtaining large-scale images. However,\npublished images in healthcare (e.g., radiology and pathology) consist of a\nconsiderable amount of compound figures with subplots. In order to extract and\nseparate compound figures into usable individual images for downstream\nlearning, we propose a simple compound figure separation (SimCFS) framework\nwithout using the traditionally required detection bounding box annotations,\nwith a new loss function and a hard case simulation. Our technical contribution\nis four-fold: (1) we introduce a simulation-based training framework that\nminimizes the need for resource extensive bounding box annotations; (2) we\npropose a new side loss that is optimized for compound figure separation; (3)\nwe propose an intra-class image augmentation method to simulate hard cases; and\n(4) to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the\nefficacy of leveraging self-supervised learning with compound image separation.\nFrom the results, the proposed SimCFS achieved state-of-the-art performance on\nthe ImageCLEF 2016 Compound Figure Separation Database.

In this work, we introduce AutoWS-Bench-101: a framework for evaluating\nautomated WS (AutoWS) techniques in challenging WS settings -- a set of diverse\napplication domains on which it has been previously difficult or impossible to\napply traditional WS techniques. While AutoWS is a promising direction toward\nexpanding the application-scope of WS, the emergence of powerful methods such\nas zero-shot foundation models reveals the need to understand how AutoWS\ntechniques compare or cooperate with modern zero-shot or few-shot learners.\nThis informs the central question of AutoWS-Bench-101: given an initial set of\n100 labels for each task, we ask whether a practitioner should use an AutoWS\nmethod to generate additional labels or use some simpler baseline, such as\nzero-shot predictions from a foundation model or supervised learning. We\nobserve that in many settings, it is necessary for AutoWS methods to\nincorporate signal from foundation models if they are to outperform simple\nfew-shot baselines, and AutoWS-Bench-101 promotes future research in this\ndirection. We conclude with a thorough ablation study of AutoWS methods.",

    "abstract": "Text-based person search is a challenging task that aims to search pedestrian\nimages with the same identity from the image gallery given a query text\ndescription. In recent years, text-based person search has made good progress,\nand state-of-the-art methods achieve superior performance by learning local\nfine-grained correspondence between images and texts. However, the existing\nmethods explicitly extract image parts and text phrases from images and texts\nby hand-crafted split or external tools and then conduct complex cross-modal\nlocal matching. Moreover, the existing methods seldom consider the problem of\ninformation inequality between modalities caused by image-specific information.\nIn this paper, we propose an efficient joint Information and Semantic Alignment\nNetwork (ISANet) for text-based person search. Specifically, we first design an\nimage-specific information suppression module, which suppresses image\nbackground and environmental factors by relation-guide localization and channel\nattention filtration respectively. This design can effectively alleviate the\nproblem of information inequality and realize the information alignment between\nimages and texts. Secondly, we propose an implicit local alignment module to\nadaptively aggregate image and text features to a set of modality-shared\nsemantic topic centers, and implicitly learn the local fine-grained\ncorrespondence between images and texts without additional supervision\ninformation and complex cross-modal interactions. Moreover, a global alignment\nis introduced as a supplement to the local perspective. Extensive experiments\non multiple databases demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the\nproposed ISANet.",

Specifically, at each time instant an adaptivity criterion\nselects new values of $\\alpha$ and $u$ based on the numerical solution of the\ndiscrete Vlasov-Poisson system obtained at that time step. Once the new values\nof the Hermite parameters $\\alpha$ and $u$ are fixed, the Hermite expansion is\nupdated and the discrete system is further evolved for the next time step. The\nprocedure is applied iteratively over the desired temporal interval. The key\naspects of the adaptive algorithm are: the map between approximation spaces\nassociated with different values of the Hermite parameters that preserves total\nmass, momentum and energy; and the adaptivity criterion to update $\\alpha$ and\n$u$ based on physics considerations relating the Hermite parameters to the\naverage velocity and temperature of each plasma species. For the discretization\nof the spatial coordinate, we rely on Fourier functions and use the implicit\nmidpoint rule for time stepping. The resulting numerical method possesses\nintrinsically the property of fluid-kinetic coupling, where the low-order terms\nof the expansion are akin to the fluid moments of a macroscopic description of\nthe plasma, while kinetic physics is retained by adding more spectral terms.\nMoreover, the scheme features conservation of total mass, momentum and energy\nassociated in the discrete, for periodic boundary conditions.

    "abstract": "Base stations (BSs) are the most energy-consuming segment of mobile networks.\nTo reduce BS energy consumption, different components of BSs can sleep when BS\nis not active. According to the activation/deactivation time of the BS\ncomponents, multiple sleep modes (SMs) are defined in the literature. In this\nstudy, we model the problem of BS energy saving utilizing multiple sleep modes\nas a sequential MDP and propose an online traffic-aware deep reinforcement\nlearning approach to maximize the long-term energy saving. However, there is a\nrisk that BS is not sleeping at the right time and incurs large delays to the\nusers. To tackle this issue, we propose to use a digital twin model to\nencapsulate the dynamics underlying the investigated system and estimate the\nrisk of decision-making (RDM) in advance. We define a novel metric to quantify\nRDM and predict the performance degradation. The RDM calculated by DT is\ncompared with a tolerable threshold set by the mobile operator. Based on this\ncomparison, BS can decide to deactivate the SMs, re-train when needed to avoid\ntaking high risks, or activate the SMs to benefit from energy savings. For deep\nreinforcement learning, we use long-short term memory (LSTM), to take into\naccount the long and short-term dependencies in input traffic, and approximate\nthe Q-function. We train the LSTM network using the experience replay method\nover a real traffic data set obtained from an operator BS in Stockholm. The\ndata set contains data rate information with very coarse-grained time\ngranularity. Thus, we propose a scheme to generate a new data set using the\nreal network data set which 1) has finer-grained time granularity and 2)\nconsiders the bursty behavior of traffic data. Simulation results show that\nusing proposed methods, considerable energy saving is obtained, compared to the\nbaselines at cost of negligible number of delayed users.",

Here we conduct a case study of a particularly\nimportant real-world platform design change: Twitter's decision to double the\ncharacter limit from 140 to 280 characters to soothe users' need to ''cram'' or\n''squeeze'' their tweets, informed by modeling of historical user behavior. In\nour analysis, we contrast Twitter's anticipated pre-intervention predictions\nabout user behavior with actual post-intervention user behavior: Did the\nplatform design change lead to the intended user behavior shifts, or did a gap\nbetween anticipated and actual behavior emerge? Did different user groups react\ndifferently? We find that even though users do not ''cram'' as much under 280\ncharacters as they used to under 140 characters, emergent ``cramming'' at the\nnew limit seems to not have been taken into account when designing the platform\nchange. Furthermore, investigating textual features, we find that, although\npost-intervention ''crammed'' tweets are longer, their syntactic and semantic\ncharacteristics remain similar and indicative of ''squeezing''. Applying the\nsame approach as Twitter policy-makers, we create updated counterfactual\nestimates and find that the character limit would need to be increased further\nto reduce cramming that re-emerged at the new limit.

To address upcoming strict criteria, a new\nopen radio access network (O-RAN) with distinguishing features such as flexible\ndesign, disaggregated virtual and programmable components, and intelligent\nclosed-loop control was developed. O-RAN slicing is being investigated as a\ncritical strategy for ensuring network quality of service (QoS) in the face of\nchanging circumstances. However, distinct network slices must be dynamically\ncontrolled to avoid service level agreement (SLA) variation caused by rapid\nchanges in the environment.

However, it remains\nunclear to what extent digital traces reflect real food consumption. The\npresent study aims to bridge this gap by quantifying the link between dietary\nbehaviors as captured via social media (Twitter) v.s. a food-tracking\napplication (MyFoodRepo). We focus on the case of Switzerland and contrast\nimages of foods collected through the two platforms, by designing and deploying\na novel crowdsourcing framework for estimating biases with respect to\nnutritional properties and appearance. We find that the food type distributions\nin social media v.s. food tracking diverge; e.g., bread is 2.5 times more\nfrequent among consumed and tracked foods than on Twitter, whereas cake is 12\ntimes more frequent on Twitter. Controlling for the different food type\ndistributions, we contrast consumed and tracked foods of a given type with\nfoods shared on Twitter. Across food types, food posted on Twitter is perceived\nas tastier, more caloric, less healthy, less likely to have been consumed at\nhome, more complex, and larger-portioned, compared to consumed and tracked\nfoods. The fact that there is a divergence between food consumption as measured\nvia the two platforms implies that at least one of the two is not a faithful\nrepresentation of the true food consumption in the general Swiss population.\nThus, researchers should be attentive and aim to establish evidence of validity\nbefore using digital traces as a proxy for the true food consumption of a\ngeneral population. We conclude by discussing the potential sources of these\nbiases and their implications, outlining pitfalls and threats to validity, and\nproposing actionable ways for overcoming them.",

    "abstract": "Perception of obstacles remains a critical safety concern for autonomous\nvehicles. Real-world collisions have shown that the autonomy faults leading to\nfatal collisions originate from obstacle existence detection. Open source\nautonomous driving implementations show a perception pipeline with complex\ninterdependent Deep Neural Networks. These networks are not fully verifiable,\nmaking them unsuitable for safety-critical tasks.\nIn this work, we present a safety verification of an existing LiDAR based\nclassical obstacle detection algorithm. We establish strict bounds on the\ncapabilities of this obstacle detection algorithm. Given safety standards, such\nbounds allow for determining LiDAR sensor properties that would reliably\nsatisfy the standards. Such analysis has as yet been unattainable for neural\nnetwork based perception systems. We provide a rigorous analysis of the\nobstacle detection system with empirical results based on real-world sensor\ndata.",

    "abstract": "Competition between traditional platforms is known to improve user utility by\naligning the platform's actions with user preferences. But to what extent is\nalignment exhibited in data-driven marketplaces? To study this question from a\ntheoretical perspective, we introduce a duopoly market where platform actions\nare bandit algorithms and the two platforms compete for user participation. A\nsalient feature of this market is that the quality of recommendations depends\non both the bandit algorithm and the amount of data provided by interactions\nfrom users. This interdependency between the algorithm performance and the\nactions of users complicates the structure of market equilibria and their\nquality in terms of user utility. Our main finding is that competition in this\nmarket does not perfectly align market outcomes with user utility.\nInterestingly, market outcomes exhibit misalignment not only when the platforms\nhave separate data repositories, but also when the platforms have a shared data\nrepository. Nonetheless, the data sharing assumptions impact what mechanism\ndrives misalignment and also affect the specific form of misalignment (e.g. the\nquality of the best-case and worst-case market outcomes). More broadly, our\nwork illustrates that competition in digital marketplaces has subtle\nconsequences for user utility that merit further investigation.",

Molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulation is the primary tool for the study of transition processes in\nbiomolecules, but it is hampered by a huge timescale gap between the processes\nof interest and atomic vibrations which dictate the time step size. Therefore,\nit is imperative to combine MD simulations with other techniques in order to\nquantify the transition processes taking place on large timescales. In this\nwork, the diffusion map with Mahalanobis kernel, a meshless approach for\napproximating the Backward Kolmogorov Operator (BKO) in collective variables,\nis upgraded to incorporate standard enhanced sampling techniques such as\nmetadynamics. The resulting algorithm, which we call the \"target measure\nMahalanobis diffusion map\" (tm-mmap), is suitable for a moderate number of\ncollective variables in which one can approximate the diffusion tensor and free\nenergy.Imposing appropriate boundary conditions allows use of the approximated\nBKO to solve for the committor function and utilization of transition path\ntheory to find the reactive current delineating the transition channels and the\ntransition rate.

A simple choice of this\nparameter is to use $\\theta f$ in order to exponentially tilt the distribution\nof the outcome of the search algorithm under the null distribution of no\ntuning, so that an exponential family of distributions is obtained. Such\nalgorithms are obtained by iterating a Metropolis-Hastings type of Markov\nchain, and this makes it possible to compute the their active information under\nequilibrium and non-equilibrium of the Markov chain, with or without stopping\nwhen the targeted set of fine-tuned states has been reached. Other choices of\ntuning parameters $\\theta$ are discussed as well. Nonparametric and parametric\nestimators of active information and tests of fine-tuning are developed when\nrepeated and independent outcomes of the algorithm are available. The theory is\nillustrated with examples from cosmology, student learning, reinforcement\nlearning, a Moran type model of population genetics, and evolutionary\nprogramming.",

Many scholars have attempted various ways to model the lung airway tree,\nwhich can be split into two major categories based on its nature.

The performance of a\ntypical model-based approach usually depends on the manual tuning of the model\nparameter, which can be its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is its\ndon't require a large amount of training data which can be beneficial for a\nsmall dataset like medical imaging.

There is a need for a portable and cost-effective device for\nlong-term monitoring and quantification of various bio-aerosols. To address\nthis need, we present a mobile and cost-effective label-free bio-aerosol sensor\nthat takes holographic images of flowing particulate matter concentrated by a\nvirtual impactor, which selectively slows down and guides particles larger than\n~6 microns to fly through an imaging window. The flowing particles are\nilluminated by a pulsed laser diode, casting their inline holograms on a CMOS\nimage sensor in a lens-free mobile imaging device. The illumination contains\nthree short pulses with a negligible shift of the flowing particle within one\npulse, and triplicate holograms of the same particle are recorded at a single\nframe before it exits the imaging field-of-view, revealing different\nperspectives of each particle. The particles within the virtual impactor are\nlocalized through a differential detection scheme, and a deep neural network\nclassifies the aerosol type in a label-free manner, based on the acquired\nholographic images. We demonstrated the success of this mobile bio-aerosol\ndetector with a virtual impactor using different types of pollen (i.e.,\nbermuda, elm, oak, pine, sycamore, and wheat) and achieved a blind\nclassification accuracy of 92.91%. This mobile and cost-effective device weighs\n~700 g and can be used for label-free sensing and quantification of various\nbio-aerosols over extended periods since it is based on a cartridge-free\nvirtual impactor that does not capture or immobilize particulate matter.",

These estimations exhibit high inter-observer variability due to the\nmanual process and varying video quality. Such sources of inaccuracy and the\nneed for rapid assessment necessitate reliable and explainable machine learning\ntechniques. In this work, we introduce EchoGNN, a model based on graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) to estimate EF from echo videos. Our model first infers a\nlatent echo-graph from the frames of one or multiple echo cine series. It then\nestimates weights over nodes and edges of this graph, indicating the importance\nof individual frames that aid EF estimation. A GNN regressor uses this weighted\ngraph to predict EF. We show, qualitatively and quantitatively, that the\nlearned graph weights provide explainability through identification of critical\nframes for EF estimation, which can be used to determine when human\nintervention is required. On EchoNet-Dynamic public EF dataset, EchoGNN\nachieves EF prediction performance that is on par with state of the art and\nprovides explainability, which is crucial given the high inter-observer\nvariability inherent in this task.",

Quantum neural networks (QNNs), which exert the power of modern\nquantum machines, have emerged as a leading protocol to conquer this issue. As\nsuch, how to enhance the performance of QNNs becomes a crucial topic in GSP.\nEmpirical evidence showed that QNNs with handcraft symmetric ansatzes generally\nexperience better trainability than those with asymmetric ansatzes, while\ntheoretical explanations have not been explored. To fill this knowledge gap,\nhere we propose the effective quantum neural tangent kernel (EQNTK) and connect\nthis concept with over-parameterization theory to quantify the convergence of\nQNNs towards the global optima. We uncover that the advance of symmetric\nansatzes attributes to their large EQNTK value with low effective dimension,\nwhich requests few parameters and quantum circuit depth to reach the\nover-parameterization regime permitting a benign loss landscape and fast\nconvergence. Guided by EQNTK, we further devise a symmetric pruning (SP) scheme\nto automatically tailor a symmetric ansatz from an over-parameterized and\nasymmetric one to greatly improve the performance of QNNs when the explicit\nsymmetry information of Hamiltonian is unavailable.

Once the\nnominal fidelity is sufficiently high, we approximate both the nominal fidelity\nand robustness measure as quadratics in the control increments. An optimal\nsolution is obtained by solving a convex optimization for the control\nincrements at each iteration to keep the nominal fidelity high and reduce the\nrobustness measure. Additionally, by separating fidelity from the robustness\nmeasure, more flexibility is available for uncertainty modeling.",

    "abstract": "Staining reveals the micro structure of the aspirate while creating\nhistopathology slides. Stain variation, defined as a chromatic difference\nbetween the source and the target, is caused by varying characteristics during\nstaining, resulting in a distribution shift and poor performance on the target.\nThe goal of stain normalization is to match the target's chromatic distribution\nto that of the source. However, stain normalisation causes the underlying\nmorphology to distort, resulting in an incorrect diagnosis. We propose FUSION,\na new method for promoting stain-adaption by adjusting the model to the target\nin an unsupervised test-time scenario, eliminating the necessity for\nsignificant labelling at the target end. FUSION works by altering the target's\nbatch normalization statistics and fusing them with source statistics using a\nweighting factor. The algorithm reduces to one of two extremes based on the\nweighting factor. Despite the lack of training or supervision, FUSION surpasses\nexisting equivalent algorithms for classification and dense predictions\n(segmentation), as demonstrated by comprehensive experiments on two public\ndatasets.",

    "abstract": "We formulate an effective numerical scheme that can readily, and accurately,\ncalculate the dynamics of weakly interacting multi-pulse solutions of the\nquintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (QCGLE) in one space dimension. The\nscheme is based on a global centre-manifold reduction where one considers the\nsolution of the QCGLE as the composition of individual pulses plus a remainder\nfunction, which is orthogonal to the adjoint eigenfunctions of the linearised\noperator about a single pulse. This centre-manifold projection overcomes the\ndifficulties of other, more orthodox, numerical schemes, by yielding a\nfast-slow system describing 'slow' ordinary differential equations for the\nlocations and phases of the individual pulses, and a 'fast' partial\ndifferential equation for the remainder function. With small parameter\n$\\epsilon=e^{-\\lambda_r d}$ where $\\lambda_r$ is a constant and $d>0$ is the\npulse separation distance, we write the fast-slow system in terms of\nfirst-order and second-order correction terms only, a formulation which is\nsolved more efficiently than the full system. This fast-slow system is\nintegrated numerically using adaptive time-stepping. Results are presented here\nfor two- and three-pulse interactions. For the two-pulse problem, cells of\nperiodic behaviour, separated by an infinite set of heteroclinic orbits, are\nshown to 'split' under perturbation creating complex spiral behaviour. For the\ncase of three pulse interaction a range of dynamics, including chaotic pulse\ninteraction, are found. While results are presented for pulse interaction in\nthe QCGLE, the numerical scheme can also be applied to a wider class of\nparabolic PDEs.",

    "abstract": "In recent year, quantum image processing got a lot of attention in the field\nof image processing due to opportunity to place huge image data in quantum\nHilbert space. Hilbert space or Euclidean space has infinite dimension to\nlocate and process the image data faster. Moreover, several researches show\nthat, the computational time of quantum process is faster than classical\ncomputer. By encoding and compressing the image in quantum domain is still\nchallenging issue. From literature survey, we have proposed a DCTEFRQI (Direct\nCosine Transform Efficient Flexible Representation of Quantum Image) algorithm\nto represent and compress gray image efficiently which save computational time\nand minimize the complexity of preparation. The objective of this work is to\nrepresent and compress various gray image size in quantum computer using\nDCT(Discrete Cosine Transform) and EFRQI (Efficient Flexible Representation of\nQuantum Image) approach together. Quirk simulation tool is used to design\ncorresponding quantum image circuit. Due to limitation of qubit, total 16\nnumbers of qubit are used to represent the gray scale image among those 8 are\nused to map the coefficient values and the rest 8 are used to generate the\ncorresponding coefficient position. Theoretical analysis and experimental\nresult show that, proposed DCTEFRQI scheme provides better representation and\ncompression compare to DCT-GQIR, DWT-GQIR and DWT-EFRQI in terms of PSNR(Peak\nSignal to Noise Ratio) and bit rate..",

To overcome the common problems of previous work in\ndiagnosing reactor accidents using deep learning theory, this paper proposes a\ndiagnostic process that ensures robustness to noisy and crippled data and is\ninterpretable. First, a novel Denoising Padded Autoencoder (DPAE) is proposed\nfor representation extraction of monitoring data, with representation extractor\nstill effective on disturbed data with signal-to-noise ratios up to 25.0 and\nmonitoring data missing up to 40.0%.

Finally, a hierarchical interpretation algorithm using\nSHAP and feature ablation is presented to analyze the importance of the input\nmonitoring parameters and validate the effectiveness of the high importance\nparameters.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new algorithm for numerically computing equilibrium\n(i.e. stationary) distributions for Markov chains and Markov jump processes\nwith either a very large finite state space or a countably infinite state\nspace. The algorithm is based on a ratio representation for equilibrium\nexpectations in which the numerator and denominator correspond to expectations\ndefined over paths that start and end within a given return set $K$. When $K$\nis a singleton, this representation is a well-known consequence of regenerative\nprocess theory. For computational tractability, we ignore contributions to the\npath expectations corresponding to excursions out of a given truncation set\n$A$. This yields a truncation algorithm that is provably convergent as $A$ gets\nlarge. Furthermore, in the presence of a suitable Lyapunov function, we can\nbound the path expectations, thereby providing computable and convergent error\nbounds for our numerical procedure. Our paper also provides a computational\ncomparison with two other truncation methods that come with computable error\nbounds. The results are in alignment with the observation that our bounds have\nassociated computational complexities that typically scale better as the\ntruncation set gets bigger.",

    "title": "On the first-order transduction quasiorder of hereditary classes of  graphs",
    "abstract": "Logical transductions provide a very useful tool to encode classes of\nstructures inside other classes of structures, and several important class\nproperties can be defined in terms of transductions. In this paper we study\nfirst-order (FO) transductions and the quasiorder they induce on infinite\nclasses of finite graphs. Surprisingly, this quasiorder is very complex, though\nshaped by the locality properties of first-order logic. This contrasts with the\nconjectured simplicity of the monadic second order (MSO) transduction\nquasiorder. We first establish a local normal form for FO transductions, which\nis of independent interest. This normal form allows to prove, among other\nresults, that the local variants of (monadic) stability and (monadic)\ndependence are equivalent to their non-local versions. Then we prove that the\nquotient partial order is a bounded distributive join-semilattice, and that the\nsubposet of additive classes is also a bounded distributive join-semilattice.\nWe characterize transductions of paths, cubic graphs, and cubic trees in terms\nof bandwidth, bounded degree, and treewidth. We establish that the classes of\nall graphs with pathwidth at most $k$, for $k\\geq 1$ form a strict hierarchy in\nthe FO transduction quasiorder and leave open whether the same holds for the\nclasses of all graphs with treewidth at most $k$. We identify the obstructions\nfor a class to be a transduction of a class with bounded degree, leading to an\ninteresting transduction duality formulation. Eventually, we discuss a notion\nof dense analogs of sparse transduction-preserved class properties, and propose\nseveral related conjectures.",
