    "abstract": "The numerical modeling of thin shell structures is a challenge, which has\nbeen met by a variety of finite element (FE) and other formulations -- many of\nwhich give rise to new challenges, from complex implementations to artificial\nlocking. As a potential alternative, we use machine learning and present a\nPhysics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to predict the small-strain response of\narbitrarily curved shells. To this end, the shell midsurface is described by a\nchart, from which the mechanical fields are derived in a curvilinear coordinate\nframe by adopting Naghdi's shell theory. Unlike in typical PINN applications,\nthe corresponding strong or weak form must therefore be solved in a\nnon-Euclidean domain. We investigate the performance of the proposed PINN in\nthree distinct scenarios, including the well-known Scordelis-Lo roof setting\nwidely used to test FE shell elements against locking. Results show that the\nPINN can accurately identify the solution field in all three benchmarks if the\nequations are presented in their weak form, while it may fail to do so when\nusing the strong form. In the thin-thickness limit, where classical methods are\nsusceptible to locking, training time notably increases as the differences in\nscaling of the membrane, shear, and bending energies lead to adverse numerical\nstiffness in the gradient flow dynamics. Nevertheless, the PINN can accurately\nmatch the ground truth and performs well in the Scordelis-Lo roof benchmark,\nhighlighting its potential for a drastically simplified alternative to\ndesigning locking-free shell FE formulations.",

Particular\nemphasis is put on its computational implementation in a multiphysics finite\nelement code. The algorithm is based on the method of partial Dirichlet-Neumann\nboundary conditions and is capable to solve numerically a nonlinear contact\nproblem between rigid and deformable bodies in a whole parallel framework. Its\ndistinctive characteristic is that the contact is tackled as a coupled problem,\nin which the contacting bodies are treated separately, in a staggered way.\nThen, the coupling is performed through the exchange of boundary conditions at\nthe contact interface following a Gauss-Seidel strategy. To validate this\nalgorithm we conducted several benchmark tests by comparing the proposed\nsolution against theoretical and other numerical solutions. Finally, we\nevaluated the parallel performance of the proposed algorithm in a real impact\ntest to show its capabilities for large-scale applications.",

    "abstract": "Generating representations that precisely reflect customers' behavior is an\nimportant task for providing personalized skill routing experience in Alexa.\nCurrently, Dynamic Routing (DR) team, which is responsible for routing Alexa\ntraffic to providers or skills, relies on two features to be served as personal\nsignals: absolute traffic count and normalized traffic count of every skill\nusage per customer. Neither of them considers the network based structure for\ninteractions between customers and skills, which contain richer information for\ncustomer preferences. In this work, we first build a heterogeneous edge\nattributed graph based customers' past interactions with the invoked skills, in\nwhich the user requests (utterances) are modeled as edges. Then we propose a\ngraph convolutional network(GCN) based model, namely Personalized Dynamic\nRouting Feature Encoder(PDRFE), that generates personalized customer\nrepresentations learned from the built graph. Compared with existing models,\nPDRFE is able to further capture contextual information in the graph\nconvolutional function. The performance of our proposed model is evaluated by a\ndownstream task, defect prediction, that predicts the defect label from the\nlearned embeddings of customers and their triggered skills. We observe up to\n41% improvements on the cross entropy metric for our proposed models compared\nto the baselines.",

    "abstract": "Research on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) from third-person videos has\nshown encouraging results on removing the need for manual reward design for\nrobotic tasks. However, most prior works are still limited by training from a\nrelatively restricted domain of videos. In this paper, we argue that the true\npotential of third-person IRL lies in increasing the diversity of videos for\nbetter scaling. To learn a reward function from diverse videos, we propose to\nperform graph abstraction on the videos followed by temporal matching in the\ngraph space to measure the task progress. Our insight is that a task can be\ndescribed by entity interactions that form a graph, and this graph abstraction\ncan help remove irrelevant information such as textures, resulting in more\nrobust reward functions. We evaluate our approach, GraphIRL, on\ncross-embodiment learning in X-MAGICAL and learning from human demonstrations\nfor real-robot manipulation. We show significant improvements in robustness to\ndiverse video demonstrations over previous approaches, and even achieve better\nresults than manual reward design on a real robot pushing task.

Despite their effectiveness, however, most of the\ncurrent recommendation models rely on sufficient and high-quality training\ndata, such that the learned representations can well capture accurate user\npreference. User behavior data in many practical recommendation scenarios is\noften noisy and exhibits skewed distribution, which may result in suboptimal\nrepresentation performance in GNN-based models. In this paper, we propose SHT,\na novel Self-Supervised Hypergraph Transformer framework (SHT) which augments\nuser representations by exploring the global collaborative relationships in an\nexplicit way. Specifically, we first empower the graph neural CF paradigm to\nmaintain global collaborative effects among users and items with a hypergraph\ntransformer network. With the distilled global context, a cross-view generative\nself-supervised learning component is proposed for data augmentation over the\nuser-item interaction graph, so as to enhance the robustness of recommender\nsystems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHT can significantly improve\nthe performance over various state-of-the-art baselines.

    "abstract": "We share our recent findings in an attempt to train a universal segmentation\nnetwork for various cell types and imaging modalities. Our method was built on\nthe generalized U-Net architecture, which allows the evaluation of each\ncomponent individually. We modified the traditional binary training targets to\ninclude three classes for direct instance segmentation. Detailed experiments\nwere performed regarding training schemes, training settings, network\nbackbones, and individual modules on the segmentation performance. Our proposed\ntraining scheme draws minibatches in turn from each dataset, and the gradients\nare accumulated before an optimization step. We found that the key to training\na universal network is all-time supervision on all datasets, and it is\nnecessary to sample each dataset in an unbiased way. Our experiments also\nsuggest that there might exist common features to define cell boundaries across\ncell types and imaging modalities, which could allow application of trained\nmodels to totally unseen datasets. A few training tricks can further boost the\nsegmentation performance, including uneven class weights in the cross-entropy\nloss function, well-designed learning rate scheduler, larger image crops for\ncontextual information, and additional loss terms for unbalanced classes. We\nalso found that segmentation performance can benefit from group normalization\nlayer and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, thanks to their more reliable\nstatistics estimation and improved semantic understanding, respectively.

The\nmost common definition is that of partial equivalence, namely that the two\nfunctions emit the same output if they are fed with the same input and they\nboth terminate. The strategy used by the Regression Verification Tool (RVT) is\nto progress bottom up on the call graphs of $P_1,P_2$, abstract those functions\nthat were already proven to be equivalent with uninterpreted functions, turn\nloops into recursion, and abstract the recursive calls also with uninterpreted\nfunctions. This enables it to create verification conditions in the form of\nsmall programs that are loop- and recursion-free. This method works well for\nrecursive functions as long as they are in sync, and typically fails otherwise.\nIn this work we study the problem of proving equivalence when the two recursive\nfunctions are not in sync. Effectively we extend previous work that studied\nthis problem for functions with a single recursive call site, to the general\ncase. We also introduce a method for detecting automatically the unrolling that\nis necessary for making two recursive functions synchronize, when possible.

    "title": "Improving Few-shot News Recommendation via Cross-lingual Transfer",
    "abstract": "The cold-start problem has been commonly recognized in recommendation systems\nand studied by following a general idea to leverage the abundant interaction\nrecords of warm users to infer the preference of cold users. However, the\nperformance of these solutions is limited by the amount of records available\nfrom warm users to use. Thus, building a recommendation system based on few\ninteraction records from a few users still remains a challenging problem for\nunpopular or early-stage recommendation platforms. This paper focuses on\nsolving the few-shot recommendation problem for news recommendation based on\ntwo observations. First, news at different platforms (even in different\nlanguages) may share similar topics. Second, the user preference over these\ntopics is transferable across different platforms. Therefore, we propose to\nsolve the few-shot news recommendation problem by transferring the user-news\npreference from a rich source domain to a low-resource target domain. To bridge\ntwo domains in different languages without any overlapping users and news, we\npropose a novel unsupervised cross-lingual transfer model as the news encoder\nthat aligns semantically similar news in two domains. A user encoder is\nconstructed on top of the aligned news encoding and transfers the user\npreference from the source to the target domain. Experimental results on two\nreal-world news recommendation datasets show the superior performance of our\nproposed method on addressing few-shot news recommendation, comparing to the\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

However, deploying it in\npractice is quite challenging, due to adopting parameter inefficient global\nupdate and heavily relying on high-quality downstream data. Recently,\nprompt-based learning, which adds a task-relevant prompt to adapt the\ndownstream tasks to pre-trained models, has drastically boosted the performance\nof many natural language downstream tasks. In this work, we extend this notable\ntransfer ability benefited from prompt into vision models as an alternative to\nfine-tuning. To this end, we propose parameter-efficient Prompt tuning\n(Pro-tuning) to adapt frozen vision models to various downstream vision tasks.\nThe key to Pro-tuning is prompt-based tuning, i.e., learning task-specific\nvision prompts for downstream input images with the pre-trained model frozen.\nBy only training a few additional parameters, it can work on diverse CNN-based\nand Transformer-based architectures. Extensive experiments evidence that\nPro-tuning outperforms fine-tuning in a broad range of vision tasks and\nscenarios, including image classification (generic objects, class imbalance,\nimage corruption, adversarial robustness, and out-of-distribution\ngeneralization), and dense prediction tasks such as object detection and\nsemantic segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven reduced-order models often fail to make accurate forecasts of\nhigh-dimensional nonlinear systems that are sensitive along coordinates with\nlow-variance because such coordinates are often truncated, e.g., by proper\northogonal decomposition, kernel principal component analysis, and\nautoencoders. Such systems are encountered frequently in shear-dominated fluid\nflows where non-normality plays a significant role in the growth of\ndisturbances. In order to address these issues, we employ ideas from active\nsubspaces to find low-dimensional systems of coordinates for model reduction\nthat balance adjoint-based information about the system's sensitivity with the\nvariance of states along trajectories. The resulting method, which we refer to\nas covariance balancing reduction using adjoint snapshots (CoBRAS), is\nidentical to balanced truncation with state and adjoint-based gradient\ncovariance matrices replacing the system Gramians and obeying the same key\ntransformation laws. Here, the extracted coordinates are associated with an\noblique projection that can be used to construct Petrov-Galerkin reduced-order\nmodels. We provide an efficient snapshot-based computational method analogous\nto balanced proper orthogonal decomposition. This also leads to the observation\nthat the reduced coordinates can be computed relying on inner products of state\nand gradient samples alone, allowing us to find rich nonlinear coordinates by\nreplacing the inner product with a kernel function. In these coordinates,\nreduced-order models can be learned using regression. We demonstrate these\ntechniques and compare to a variety of other methods on a simple, yet\nchallenging three-dimensional system and an axisymmetric jet flow simulation\nwith $10^5$ state variables.",

    "abstract": "While value iteration (VI) is a standard solution approach to simple\nstochastic games (SSGs), it suffered from the lack of a stopping criterion.\nRecently, several solutions have appeared, among them also \"optimistic\" VI\n(OVI). However, OVI is applicable only to one-player SSGs with no end\ncomponents. We lift these two assumptions, making it available to general SSGs.\nFurther, we utilize the idea in the context of topological VI, where we provide\nan efficient precise solution. In order to compare the new algorithms with the\nstate of the art, we use not only the standard benchmarks, but we also design a\nrandom generator of SSGs, which can be biased towards various types of models,\naiding in understanding the advantages of different algorithms on SSGs.",

As a result, the proposed scheme enables a novel transmission of\nthree signal domains: SS and sub-carrier indices, and a single M-ary symbol.\nFor practical implementations, two reduced-complexity near-optimal detectors\nare proposed, which have complexities less depending on the M-ary modulation\nsize. Then, the bit error probability and its upper bound are analyzed to gain\nan insight into the diversity gain, which is shown to be strongly affected by\nthe order of sub-carrier indices. Based on this observation, we propose two\nnovel sub-carrier index mapping methods, which significantly increase the\ndiversity gain of SSSIM-OFDM.

    "abstract": "The success of neural fields for 3D vision tasks is now indisputable.\nFollowing this trend, several methods aiming for visual localization (e.g.,\nSLAM) have been proposed to estimate distance or density fields using neural\nfields. However, it is difficult to achieve high localization performance by\nonly density fields-based methods such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) since\nthey do not provide density gradient in most empty regions. On the other hand,\ndistance field-based methods such as Neural Implicit Surface (NeuS) have\nlimitations in objects' surface shapes. This paper proposes Neural\nDensity-Distance Field (NeDDF), a novel 3D representation that reciprocally\nconstrains the distance and density fields. We extend distance field\nformulation to shapes with no explicit boundary surface, such as fur or smoke,\nwhich enable explicit conversion from distance field to density field.\nConsistent distance and density fields realized by explicit conversion enable\nboth robustness to initial values and high-quality registration. Furthermore,\nthe consistency between fields allows fast convergence from sparse point\nclouds. Experiments show that NeDDF can achieve high localization performance\nwhile providing comparable results to NeRF on novel view synthesis.

    "title": "Locally-iterative $(\u0394+1)$-Coloring in Sublinear (in $\u0394$)  Rounds",
    "abstract": "Distributed graph coloring is one of the most extensively studied problems in\ndistributed computing. There is a canonical family of distributed graph\ncoloring algorithms known as the locally-iterative coloring algorithms, first\nformalized in the seminal work of [Szegedy and Vishwanathan, STOC'93]. In such\nalgorithms, every vertex iteratively updates its own color according to a\npredetermined function of the current coloring of its local neighborhood. Due\nto the simplicity and naturalness of its framework, locally-iterative coloring\nalgorithms are of great significance both in theory and practice. In this\npaper, we give a locally-iterative $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithm with\n$O(\\Delta^{3/4}\\log\\Delta)+\\log^*n$ running time. This is the first\nlocally-iterative $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithm with sublinear-in-$\\Delta$\nrunning time, and answers the main open question raised in a recent\nbreakthrough [Barenboim, Elkin, and Goldberg, JACM'21]. A key component of our\nalgorithm is a locally-iterative procedure that transforms an\n$O(\\Delta^2)$-coloring to a $(\\Delta+O(\\Delta^{3/4}\\log\\Delta))$-coloring in\n$o(\\Delta)$ time. Inside this procedure we work on special proper colorings\nthat encode (arb)defective colorings, and reduce the number of used colors\nquadratically in a locally-iterative fashion. As a main application of our\nresult, we also give a self-stabilizing distributed algorithm for\n$(\\Delta+1)$-coloring with $O(\\Delta^{3/4}\\log\\Delta)+\\log^*n$ stabilization\ntime. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first self-stabilizing\nalgorithm for $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring with sublinear-in-$\\Delta$ stabilization\ntime.",

Particularly, we propose a generalized framework to\nderive the BER for both the low-complexity greedy detector (GD) and maximum\nlikelihood (ML) detector. Based on this, closedform expressions for the BERs of\nMCIK-OFDM with the SC using either the ML or the GD are derived in presence of\nthe channel state information (CSI) imperfection. The asymptotic analysis is\npresented to gain helpful insights into effects of different CSI conditions on\nthe BERs of these two detectors.

    "title": "Fine-grained Retrieval Prompt Tuning",
    "abstract": "Fine-grained object retrieval aims to learn discriminative representation to\nretrieve visually similar objects. However, existing top-performing works\nusually impose pairwise similarities on the semantic embedding spaces to\ncontinually fine-tune the entire model in limited-data regimes, thus resulting\nin easily converging to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we develop\nFine-grained Retrieval Prompt Tuning (FRPT), which steers a frozen pre-trained\nmodel to perform the fine-grained retrieval task from the perspectives of\nsample prompt and feature adaptation. Specifically, FRPT only needs to learn\nfewer parameters in the prompt and adaptation instead of fine-tuning the entire\nmodel, thus solving the convergence to suboptimal solutions caused by\nfine-tuning the entire model. Technically, as sample prompts, a structure\nperturbation prompt (SPP) is introduced to zoom and even exaggerate some pixels\ncontributing to category prediction via a content-aware inhomogeneous sampling\noperation. In this way, SPP can make the fine-grained retrieval task aided by\nthe perturbation prompts close to the solved task during the original\npre-training. Besides, a category-specific awareness head is proposed and\nregarded as feature adaptation, which removes the species discrepancies in the\nfeatures extracted by the pre-trained model using instance normalization, and\nthus makes the optimized features only include the discrepancies among\nsubcategories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FRPT with fewer\nlearnable parameters achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three\nwidely-used fine-grained datasets.",

    "abstract": "Non-orthogonal communications are expected to play a key role in future\nwireless systems. In downlink transmissions, the data symbols are broadcast\nfrom a base station to different users, which are superimposed with different\npower to facilitate high-integrity detection using successive interference\ncancellation (SIC). However, SIC requires accurate knowledge of both the\nchannel model and channel state information (CSI), which may be difficult to\nacquire. We propose a deep learningaided SIC detector termed SICNet, which\nreplaces the interference cancellation blocks of SIC by deep neural networks\n(DNNs). Explicitly, SICNet jointly trains its internal DNN-aided blocks for\ninferring the soft information representing the interfering symbols in a\ndata-driven fashion, rather than using hard-decision decoders as in classical\nSIC. As a result, SICNet reliably detects the superimposed symbols in the\ndownlink of non-orthogonal systems without requiring any prior knowledge of the\nchannel model, while being less sensitive to CSI uncertainty than its\nmodel-based counterpart. SICNet is also robust to changes in the number of\nusers and to their power allocation. Furthermore, SICNet learns to produce\naccurate soft outputs, which facilitates improved soft-input error correction\ndecoding compared to model-based SIC. Finally, we propose an online training\nmethod for SICNet under block fading, which exploits the channel decoding for\naccurately recovering online data labels for retraining, hence, allowing it to\nsmoothly track the fading envelope without requiring dedicated pilots. Our\nnumerical results show that SICNet approaches the performance of classical SIC\nunder perfect CSI, while outperforming it under realistic CSI uncertainty.",

Most existing solutions are based on an ideal assumption\nthat the label noise is class-conditional, i.e., instances of the same class\nshare the same noise model, and are independent of features. While in practice,\nthe real-world noise patterns are usually more fine-grained as\ninstance-dependent ones, which poses a big challenge, especially in the\npresence of inter-class imbalance. In this paper, we propose a two-stage clean\nsamples identification method to address the aforementioned challenge. First,\nwe employ a class-level feature clustering procedure for the early\nidentification of clean samples that are near the class-wise prediction\ncenters. Notably, we address the class imbalance problem by aggregating rare\nclasses according to their prediction entropy. Second, for the remaining clean\nsamples that are close to the ground truth class boundary (usually mixed with\nthe samples with instance-dependent noises), we propose a novel\nconsistency-based classification method that identifies them using the\nconsistency of two classifier heads: the higher the consistency, the larger the\nprobability that a sample is clean.

In this paper, we shed light on the behavior of\nthese algorithms in the full-batch and sufficiently large batch settings.\nSpecifically, we empirically demonstrate that during full-batch training, the\nmaximum eigenvalue of the preconditioned Hessian typically equilibrates at a\ncertain numerical value -- the stability threshold of a gradient descent\nalgorithm. For Adam with step size $\\eta$ and $\\beta_1 = 0.9$, this stability\nthreshold is $38/\\eta$. Similar effects occur during minibatch training,\nespecially as the batch size grows.

However, the annotation of NR-IQA is\nlabor-intensive and time-consuming, which severely limits their application\nespecially for authentic images. To relieve the dependence on quality\nannotation, some works have applied unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to\nNR-IQA. However, the above methods ignore that the alignment space used in\nclassification is sub-optimal, since the space is not elaborately designed for\nperception. To solve this challenge, we propose an effective\nperception-oriented unsupervised domain adaptation method StyleAM for NR-IQA,\nwhich transfers sufficient knowledge from label-rich source domain data to\nlabel-free target domain images via Style Alignment and Mixup. Specifically, we\nfind a more compact and reliable space i.e., feature style space for\nperception-oriented UDA based on an interesting/amazing observation, that the\nfeature style (i.e., the mean and variance) of the deep layer in DNNs is\nexactly associated with the quality score in NR-IQA. Therefore, we propose to\nalign the source and target domains in a more perceptual-oriented space i.e.,\nthe feature style space, to reduce the intervention from other\nquality-irrelevant feature factors. Furthermore, to increase the consistency\nbetween quality score and its feature style, we also propose a novel feature\naugmentation strategy Style Mixup, which mixes the feature styles (i.e., the\nmean and variance) before the last layer of DNNs together with mixing their\nlabels.

    "abstract": "Long-tailed datasets are very frequently encountered in real-world use cases\nwhere few classes or categories (known as majority or head classes) have higher\nnumber of data samples compared to the other classes (known as minority or tail\nclasses). Training deep neural networks on such datasets gives results biased\ntowards the head classes. So far, researchers have come up with multiple\nweighted loss and data re-sampling techniques in efforts to reduce the bias.\nHowever, most of such techniques assume that the tail classes are always the\nmost difficult classes to learn and therefore need more weightage or attention.\nHere, we argue that the assumption might not always hold true. Therefore, we\npropose a novel approach to dynamically measure the instantaneous difficulty of\neach class during the training phase of the model. Further, we use the\ndifficulty measures of each class to design a novel weighted loss technique\ncalled `class-wise difficulty based weighted (CDB-W) loss' and a novel data\nsampling technique called `class-wise difficulty based sampling (CDB-S)'. To\nverify the wide-scale usability of our CDB methods, we conducted extensive\nexperiments on multiple tasks such as image classification, object detection,\ninstance segmentation and video-action classification. Results verified that\nCDB-W loss and CDB-S could achieve state-of-the-art results on many\nclass-imbalanced datasets such as ImageNet-LT, LVIS and EGTEA, that resemble\nreal-world use cases.",

    "abstract": "Video stabilization is an in-camera processing commonly applied by modern\nacquisition devices. While significantly improving the visual quality of the\nresulting videos, it has been shown that such operation typically hinders the\nforensic analysis of video signals. In fact, the correct identification of the\nacquisition source usually based on Photo Response non-Uniformity (PRNU) is\nsubject to the estimation of the transformation applied to each frame in the\nstabilization phase. A number of techniques have been proposed for dealing with\nthis problem, which however typically suffer from a high computational burden\ndue to the grid search in the space of inversion parameters. Our work attempts\nto alleviate these shortcomings by exploiting the parallelization capabilities\nof Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), typically used for deep learning\napplications, in the framework of stabilised frames inversion. Moreover, we\npropose to exploit SIFT features {to estimate the camera momentum and} %to\nidentify less stabilized temporal segments, thus enabling a more accurate\nidentification analysis, and to efficiently initialize the frame-wise parameter\nsearch of consecutive frames.

Different from the typical\nformation control strategies where robots are steered to satisfy the predefined\ncontrol variables, such as pairwise distances, relative positions and bearings,\nthe foremost idea of this paper is to achieve polygon formations by injecting\ncontrol inputs randomly to a few robots (say, vertex robots) of the group, and\nthe rest follow the simple principles of moving towards the midpoint of their\ntwo nearest neighbors in the ring graph without any external inputs. In our\nproblem, a fleet of robots is initially distributed in the plane. The socalled\nvertex robots take the responsibility of determining the geometric shape of the\nentire formation and its overall size, while the others move so as to minimize\nthe differences with two direct neighbors. In the first step, each vertex robot\nestimates the number of robots in its associated chain. Two types of control\ninputs that serve for the estimation are designed using the measurements from\nthe latest and the last two time instants respectively. In the second step, the\nself-organized formation control law is proposed where only vertex robots\nreceive external information.

    "abstract": "Pre-training trajectory embeddings is a fundamental and critical procedure in\nspatial-temporal trajectory mining, and is beneficial for a wide range of\ndownstream tasks. The key for generating effective trajectory embeddings is to\nextract high-level travel semantics from trajectories, including movement\npatterns and travel purposes, with consideration of the trajectories' long-term\nspatial-temporal correlations. Despite the existing efforts, there are still\nmajor challenges in pre-training trajectory embeddings. First, commonly used\ngenerative pretext tasks are not suitable for extracting high-level semantics\nfrom trajectories. Second, existing data augmentation methods fit badly on\ntrajectory datasets. Third, current encoder designs fail to fully incorporate\nlong-term spatial-temporal correlations hidden in trajectories. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a novel Contrastive Spatial-Temporal Trajectory\nEmbedding (CSTTE) model for learning comprehensive trajectory embeddings. CSTTE\nadopts the contrastive learning framework so that its pretext task is robust to\nnoise. A specially designed data augmentation method for trajectories is\ncoupled with the contrastive pretext task to preserve the high-level travel\nsemantics. We also build an efficient spatial-temporal trajectory encoder to\nefficiently and comprehensively model the long-term spatial-temporal\ncorrelations in trajectories.

However, we found that the loss due to tile\npruning, which can eliminate important elements together with unimportant\nelements, is large on trained DNNs. In this study, we propose a one-shot\nreparameterization method, called TileTrans, to reduce the loss of tile\npruning. Specifically, we repermute the rows or columns of the weight matrix\nsuch that the model architecture can be kept unchanged after\nreparameterization. This repermutation realizes the reparameterization of the\nDNN model without any retraining. The proposed reparameterization method\ncombines important elements into the same tile; thus, preserving the important\nelements after the tile pruning. Furthermore, TileTrans can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing tile pruning methods because it is a pre-processing\nmethod executed before pruning, which is orthogonal to most existing methods.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that our method is essential in reducing\nthe loss of tile pruning on DNNs.

To be more specific, we show that for\nnon-degenerate locally observable games, the regret in the stochastic regime is\nbounded by $O(k^3 m^2 \\log(T) \\log(k_{\\Pi} T) / \\Delta_{\\mathrm{\\min}})$ and in\nthe adversarial regime by $O(k^{2/3} m \\sqrt{T \\log(T) \\log k_{\\Pi}})$, where\n$T$ is the number of rounds, $m$ is the maximum number of distinct observations\nper action, $\\Delta_{\\min}$ is the minimum optimality gap, and $k_{\\Pi}$ is the\nnumber of Pareto optimal actions. Moreover, we show that for non-degenerate\nglobally observable games, the regret in the stochastic regime is bounded by\n$O(\\max\\{c_{\\mathcal{G}}^2 / k,\\, c_{\\mathcal{G}}\\} \\log(T) \\log(k_{\\Pi} T) /\n\\Delta_{\\min}^2)$ and in the adversarial regime by $O((\\max\\{c_{\\mathcal{G}}^2\n/ k,\\, c_{\\mathcal{G}}\\} \\log(T) \\log(k_{\\Pi} T)))^{1/3} T^{2/3})$, where\n$c_{\\mathcal{G}}$ is a game-dependent constant. Our algorithms are based on the\nfollow-the-regularized-leader framework that takes into account the nature of\nthe partial monitoring problem, inspired by algorithms in the field of online\nlearning with feedback graphs.",

    "title": "ScaleFormer: Revisiting the Transformer-based Backbones from a  Scale-wise Perspective for Medical Image Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Recently, a variety of vision transformers have been developed as their\ncapability of modeling long-range dependency. In current transformer-based\nbackbones for medical image segmentation, convolutional layers were replaced\nwith pure transformers, or transformers were added to the deepest encoder to\nlearn global context. However, there are mainly two challenges in a scale-wise\nperspective: (1) intra-scale problem: the existing methods lacked in extracting\nlocal-global cues in each scale, which may impact the signal propagation of\nsmall objects; (2) inter-scale problem: the existing methods failed to explore\ndistinctive information from multiple scales, which may hinder the\nrepresentation learning from objects with widely variable size, shape and\nlocation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backbone, namely\nScaleFormer, with two appealing designs: (1) A scale-wise intra-scale\ntransformer is designed to couple the CNN-based local features with the\ntransformer-based global cues in each scale, where the row-wise and column-wise\nglobal dependencies can be extracted by a lightweight Dual-Axis MSA. (2) A\nsimple and effective spatial-aware inter-scale transformer is designed to\ninteract among consensual regions in multiple scales, which can highlight the\ncross-scale dependency and resolve the complex scale variations. Experimental\nresults on different benchmarks demonstrate that our Scale-Former outperforms\nthe current state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Quantifying the safety of the human body orientation is an important issue in\nhuman-robot interaction. Knowing the changing physical constraints on human\nmotion can improve inspection of safe human motions and bring essential\ninformation about stability and normality of human body orientations with\nreal-time risk assessment. Also, this information can be used in cooperative\nrobots and monitoring systems to evaluate and interact in the environment more\nfreely. Furthermore, the workspace area can be more deterministic with the\nknown physical characteristics of safety. Based on this motivation, we propose\na novel predictive safety model (PSM) that relies on the information of an\ninertial measurement unit on the human chest. The PSM encompasses a 3-Dofs\nspring-damper pendulum model that predicts human motion based on a safe motion\ndataset. The estimated safe orientation of humans is obtained by integrating a\nsafety dataset and an elastic spring-damper model in a way that the proposed\napproach can realize complex motions at different safety levels. We did\nexperiments in a real-world scenario to verify our novel proposed model. This\nnovel approach can be used in different guidance/assistive robots and health\nmonitoring systems to support and evaluate the human condition, particularly\nelders.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning with domain randomization learns a control policy\nin various simulations with randomized physical and sensor model parameters to\nbecome transferable to the real world in a zero-shot setting. However, a huge\nnumber of samples are often required to learn an effective policy when the\nrange of randomized parameters is extensive due to the instability of policy\nupdates. To alleviate this problem, we propose a sample-efficient method named\nCyclic Policy Distillation (CPD). CPD divides the range of randomized\nparameters into several small sub-domains and assigns a local policy to each\nsub-domain. Then, the learning of local policies is performed while {\\it\ncyclically} transitioning the target sub-domain to neighboring sub-domains and\nexploiting the learned values/policies of the neighbor sub-domains with a\nmonotonic policy-improvement scheme. Finally, all of the learned local policies\nare distilled into a global policy for sim-to-real transfer. The effectiveness\nand sample efficiency of CPD are demonstrated through simulations with four\ntasks (Pendulum from OpenAIGym and Pusher, Swimmer, and HalfCheetah from\nMujoco), and a real-robot ball-dispersal task.",

The\nquasi-incompressible and quasiinextensible limits of transversely isotropic\nmaterials were considered. A numerical example was solved by implementing the\nT2P0F0 element on an automated differential equation solver platform, FEniCS.\nIt was shown that both the wavelength and critical growth parameter g decrease\nby increasing the fiber stiffness for the first instability, which is obtained\nalong the stiff fiber direction. The effect of the fiber stiffness is minor on\nthe secondary buckling, which was observed perpendicular to the fiber\ndirection. For a range of fiber stiffnesses, bifurcation points of\ninstabilities were also determined by monitoring displacements and energies.\nThe energy contributions of layerswith different ranges of fiber stiffnesses\nwere examined. It is concluded that the energy release mechanism at the\ninitiation of the primary buckling is mainly due to isotropic and anisotropic\ncontributions of the stiff filmlayer. For high fiber stiffnesses, the effect of\nthe anisotropic energy on the first buckling becomes more dominant over other\ntypes.

First, neural schedulers designed for cluster computing\ndomain do not work well for SoC due to i) heterogeneity of SoC computing\nresources and ii) variable action set caused by randomness in incoming jobs.\nSecond, our novel neural scheduler technique, Eclectic Interaction Matching\n(EIM), overcomes the above challenges, thus significantly improving the\nexisting neural schedulers. Specifically, we rationalize the underlying reasons\nbehind the performance gain by the EIM-based neural scheduler. Third, we\ndiscover that the ratio of the average processing elements (PE) switching delay\nand the average PE computation time significantly impacts the performance of\nneural SoC schedulers even with EIM. Consequently, future neural SoC scheduler\ndesign must consider this metric as well as its implementation overhead for\npractical utility.",

    "abstract": "Image-based artistic rendering can synthesize a variety of expressive styles\nusing algorithmic image filtering. In contrast to deep learning-based methods,\nthese heuristics-based filtering techniques can operate on high-resolution\nimages, are interpretable, and can be parameterized according to various design\naspects. However, adapting or extending these techniques to produce new styles\nis often a tedious and error-prone task that requires expert knowledge. We\npropose a new paradigm to alleviate this problem: implementing algorithmic\nimage filtering techniques as differentiable operations that can learn\nparametrizations aligned to certain reference styles. To this end, we present\nWISE, an example-based image-processing system that can handle a multitude of\nstylization techniques, such as watercolor, oil or cartoon stylization, within\na common framework. By training parameter prediction networks for global and\nlocal filter parameterizations, we can simultaneously adapt effects to\nreference styles and image content, e.g., to enhance facial features. Our\nmethod can be optimized in a style-transfer framework or learned in a\ngenerative-adversarial setting for image-to-image translation. We demonstrate\nthat jointly training an XDoG filter and a CNN for postprocessing can achieve\ncomparable results to a state-of-the-art GAN-based method.",

While the application to categorical data is straightforward, its\nusability in the context of images has been limited. Contrary to categorical\ndata the meaning of an image is inherent in the spatial correlation of\nneighboring pixels making the simple application of noise infeasible.\nInvertible Neural Networks (INN) have shown excellent generative performance\nwhile still providing the ability to quantify the exact likelihood.

    "abstract": "Vertical federated learning (VFL) is an emerging paradigm that allows\ndifferent parties (e.g., organizations or enterprises) to collaboratively build\nmachine learning models with privacy protection. In the training phase, VFL\nonly exchanges the intermediate statistics, i.e., forward activations and\nbackward derivatives, across parties to compute model gradients. Nevertheless,\ndue to its geo-distributed nature, VFL training usually suffers from the low\nWAN bandwidth.\nIn this paper, we introduce CELU-VFL, a novel and efficient VFL training\nframework that exploits the local update technique to reduce the cross-party\ncommunication rounds. CELU-VFL caches the stale statistics and reuses them to\nestimate model gradients without exchanging the ad hoc statistics. Significant\ntechniques are proposed to improve the convergence performance. First, to\nhandle the stochastic variance problem, we propose a uniform sampling strategy\nto fairly choose the stale statistics for local updates. Second, to harness the\nerrors brought by the staleness, we devise an instance weighting mechanism that\nmeasures the reliability of the estimated gradients. Theoretical analysis\nproves that CELU-VFL achieves a similar sub-linear convergence rate as vanilla\nVFL training but requires much fewer communication rounds. Empirical results on\nboth public and real-world workloads validate that CELU-VFL can be up to six\ntimes faster than the existing works.",

Beyond\nformal approaches, various attempts have been made to estimate the termination\nbehavior of programs using neural networks.

In this paper, we\nmove away from formal methods and embrace the stochastic nature of machine\nlearning models. Instead of aiming for rigorous guarantees that can be\ninterpreted by solvers, our objective is to provide an estimation of a\nprogram's termination behavior and of the likely reason for nontermination\n(when applicable) that a programmer can use for debugging purposes. Compared to\nprevious approaches using neural networks for program termination, we also take\nadvantage of the graph representation of programs by employing Graph Neural\nNetworks. To further assist programmers in understanding and debugging\nnontermination bugs, we adapt the notions of attention and semantic\nsegmentation, previously used for other application domains, to programs.\nOverall, we designed and implemented classifiers for program termination based\non Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks, as well as a\nsemantic segmentation Graph Neural Network that localizes AST nodes likely to\ncause nontermination.

For this purpose, a general state-space model for\nmobile platforms with several kinematic chains is defined, which considers\nnon-linearities and constraints. The proposed motion planner is based on a\nsequential multi-stage approach that takes advantage of the warm start on each\nstep. Firstly, a globally optimal and smooth 2D/3D trajectory is generated\nusing the Fast Marching Method. This trajectory is fed as a warm start to a\nsequential linear quadratic regulator that is able to generate an optimal\nmotion plan without constraints for all the platform actuators. Finally, a\nfeasible motion plan is generated considering the constraints defined in the\nmodel. In this respect, the sequential linear quadratic regulator is employed\nagain, taking the previously generated unconstrained motion plan as a warm\nstart. This novel approach has been deployed into the Exomars Testing Rover of\nthe European Space Agency. This rover is an Ackermann-capable planetary\nexploration testbed that is equipped with a robotic arm. Several experiments\nwere carried out demonstrating that the proposed approach speeds up the\ncomputation time, increasing the success ratio for a martian sample retrieval\nmission, which can be considered as a representative use case of an\nover-actuated mobile platform.",

The second innovation of ICET is to infer the output error\ncovariance associated with the position and orientation transformation between\nsuccessive point clouds; the error covariance is particularly useful when ICET\nis incorporated into a state-estimation routine such as an extended Kalman\nfilter.

Richer and more meaningful gradients updates are key to allow\nself-supervised methods to learn better and in a more efficient manner. In a\ntypical self-distillation framework, the representation of two augmented images\nare enforced to be coherent at the global level. Nonetheless, incorporating\nlocal cues in the proxy task can be beneficial and improve the model accuracy\non downstream tasks. This leads to a dual objective in which, on the one hand,\ncoherence between global-representations is enforced and on the other,\ncoherence between local-representations is enforced. Unfortunately, an exact\ncorrespondence mapping between two sets of local-representations does not exist\nmaking the task of matching local-representations from one augmentation to\nanother non-trivial. We propose to leverage the spatial information in the\ninput images to obtain geometric matchings and compare this geometric approach\nagainst previous methods based on similarity matchings.

In this work, we propose a side-informed\nTransformer architecture that embeds knowledge on the input compression level\nto improve recognition under strong compression. We show the effectiveness of\nTransformers for license plate recognition (LPR) on a low-quality real-world\ndataset. We also provide a synthetic dataset that includes strongly degraded,\nillegible LP images and analyze the impact of knowledge embedding on it. The\nnetwork outperforms existing FLPR methods and standard state-of-the art image\nrecognition models while requiring less parameters.

    "abstract": "With the advent and popularity of big data mining and huge text analysis in\nmodern times, automated text summarization became prominent for extracting and\nretrieving important information from documents. This research investigates\naspects of automatic text summarization from the perspectives of single and\nmultiple documents. Summarization is a task of condensing huge text articles\ninto short, summarized versions. The text is reduced in size for summarization\npurpose but preserving key vital information and retaining the meaning of the\noriginal document. This study presents the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\napproach used to perform topic modelling from summarised medical science\njournal articles with topics related to genes and diseases. In this study,\nPyLDAvis web-based interactive visualization tool was used to visualise the\nselected topics. The visualisation provides an overarching view of the main\ntopics while allowing and attributing deep meaning to the prevalence individual\ntopic. This study presents a novel approach to summarization of single and\nmultiple documents. The results suggest the terms ranked purely by considering\ntheir probability of the topic prevalence within the processed document using\nextractive summarization technique. PyLDAvis visualization describes the\nflexibility of exploring the terms of the topics' association to the fitted LDA\nmodel. The topic modelling result shows prevalence within topics 1 and 2. This\nassociation reveals that there is similarity between the terms in topic 1 and 2\nin this study. The efficacy of the LDA and the extractive summarization methods\nwere measured using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Recall-Oriented\nUnderstudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) metrics to evaluate the reliability\nand validity of the model.",

    "abstract": "We consider the setting where a service is hosted on a third-party edge\nserver deployed close to the users and a cloud server at a greater distance\nfrom the users. Due to the proximity of the edge servers to the users, requests\ncan be served at the edge with low latency. However, as the computation\nresources at the edge are limited, some requests must be routed to the cloud\nfor service and incur high latency. The system's overall performance depends on\nthe rent cost incurred to use the edge server, the latency experienced by the\nusers, and the cost incurred to change the amount of edge computation resources\nrented over time. The algorithmic challenge is to determine the amount of edge\ncomputation power to rent over time. We propose a deterministic online policy\nand characterize its performance for adversarial and stochastic i.i.d. request\narrival processes. We also characterize a fundamental bound on the performance\nof any deterministic online policy.

    "abstract": "When machine learning (ML) models are supplied with data outside their\ntraining distribution, they are more likely to make inaccurate predictions; in\na cyber-physical system (CPS), this could lead to catastrophic system failure.\nTo mitigate this risk, an out-of-distribution (OOD) detector can run in\nparallel with an ML model and flag inputs that could lead to undesirable\noutcomes. Although OOD detectors have been well studied in terms of accuracy,\nthere has been less focus on deployment to resource constrained CPSs. In this\nstudy, a design methodology is proposed to tune deep OOD detectors to meet the\naccuracy and response time requirements of embedded applications. The\nmethodology uses genetic algorithms to optimize the detector's preprocessing\npipeline and selects a quantization method that balances robustness and\nresponse time. It also identifies several candidate task graphs under the Robot\nOperating System (ROS) for deployment of the selected design. The methodology\nis demonstrated on two variational autoencoder based OOD detectors from the\nliterature on two embedded platforms. Insights into the trade-offs that occur\nduring the design process are provided, and it is shown that this design\nmethodology can lead to a drastic reduction in response time in relation to an\nunoptimized OOD detector while maintaining comparable accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is a promising approach for applications with\nnonEuclidean data. However, training GNNs on large scale graphs with hundreds\nof millions nodes is both resource and time consuming. Different from DNNs,\nGNNs usually have larger memory footprints, and thus the GPU memory capacity\nand PCIe bandwidth are the main resource bottlenecks in GNN training. To\naddress this problem, we present BiFeat: a graph feature quantization\nmethodology to accelerate GNN training by significantly reducing the memory\nfootprint and PCIe bandwidth requirement so that GNNs can take full advantage\nof GPU computing capabilities. Our key insight is that unlike DNN, GNN is less\nprone to the information loss of input features caused by quantization. We\nidentify the main accuracy impact factors in graph feature quantization and\ntheoretically prove that BiFeat training converges to a network where the loss\nis within $\\epsilon$ of the optimal loss of uncompressed network. We perform\nextensive evaluation of BiFeat using several popular GNN models and datasets,\nincluding GraphSAGE on MAG240M, the largest public graph dataset. The results\ndemonstrate that BiFeat achieves a compression ratio of more than 30 and\nimproves GNN training speed by 200%-320% with marginal accuracy loss.

    "abstract": "Temporal grounding aims to locate a target video moment that semantically\ncorresponds to the given sentence query in an untrimmed video. However, recent\nworks find that existing methods suffer a severe temporal bias problem. These\nmethods do not reason the target moment locations based on the visual-textual\nsemantic alignment but over-rely on the temporal biases of queries in training\nsets. To this end, this paper proposes a novel training framework for grounding\nmodels to use shuffled videos to address temporal bias problem without losing\ngrounding accuracy. Our framework introduces two auxiliary tasks, cross-modal\nmatching and temporal order discrimination, to promote the grounding model\ntraining. The cross-modal matching task leverages the content consistency\nbetween shuffled and original videos to force the grounding model to mine\nvisual contents to semantically match queries. The temporal order\ndiscrimination task leverages the difference in temporal order to strengthen\nthe understanding of long-term temporal contexts. Extensive experiments on\nCharades-STA and ActivityNet Captions demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod for mitigating the reliance on temporal biases and strengthening the\nmodel's generalization ability against the different temporal distributions.\nCode is available at https://github.com/haojc/ShufflingVideosForTSG.",

Consequently,\ndevelopers are faced with the difficult challenge of maintaining their project\ndependencies by keeping them up-to-date and free of security vulnerabilities.\nHowever, how often are project dependencies used in production where they could\npose a threat to their project's security?\nWe conduct an empirical study on 100 JavaScript projects using the Node\nPackage Manager (npm) to quantify how often project dependencies are released\nto production and analyze their characteristics and their impact on security.\nOur results indicate that most project dependencies are not released to\nproduction. In fact, the majority of dependencies declared as runtime\ndependencies are not used in production, while some development dependencies\nare used in production, debunking two common assumptions of dependency\nmanagement. Our analysis reveals that the functionality of a package is not\nenough to determine if it will be shipped to production or not. Findings also\nindicate that most security alerts target dependencies not used in production,\nmaking them highly unlikely to be a risk for the security of the software.

    "abstract": "Reward design is a critical part of the application of reinforcement\nlearning, the performance of which strongly depends on how well the reward\nsignal frames the goal of the designer and how well the signal assesses\nprogress in reaching that goal.

Researchers usually assist the learning of\nagents by adding some auxiliary rewards in practice. However, designing\nauxiliary rewards is often turned to a trial-and-error search for reward\nsettings that produces acceptable results. In this paper, we propose to\nautomatically generate goal-consistent intrinsic rewards for the agent to\nlearn, by maximizing which the expected accumulative extrinsic rewards can be\nmaximized. To this end, we introduce the concept of motivation which captures\nthe underlying goal of maximizing certain rewards and propose the motivation\nbased reward design method.

    "abstract": "Image-text matching is gaining a leading role among tasks involving the joint\nunderstanding of vision and language. In literature, this task is often used as\na pre-training objective to forge architectures able to jointly deal with\nimages and texts. Nonetheless, it has a direct downstream application:\ncross-modal retrieval, which consists in finding images related to a given\nquery text or vice-versa. Solving this task is of critical importance in\ncross-modal search engines. Many recent methods proposed effective solutions to\nthe image-text matching problem, mostly using recent large vision-language (VL)\nTransformer networks. However, these models are often computationally\nexpensive, especially at inference time. This prevents their adoption in\nlarge-scale cross-modal retrieval scenarios, where results should be provided\nto the user almost instantaneously. In this paper, we propose to fill in the\ngap between effectiveness and efficiency by proposing an ALign And DIstill\nNetwork (ALADIN). ALADIN first produces high-effective scores by aligning at\nfine-grained level images and texts. Then, it learns a shared embedding space -\nwhere an efficient kNN search can be performed - by distilling the relevance\nscores obtained from the fine-grained alignments. We obtained remarkable\nresults on MS-COCO, showing that our method can compete with state-of-the-art\nVL Transformers while being almost 90 times faster.

Early methods adopted oversegmentation-based strategies\nbut suffered from low speed, insufficient accuracy, and high cost of character\nsegmentation annotations. Recently, segmentation-free methods based on\nconnectionist temporal classification (CTC) and attention mechanism, have\ndominated the field of HCTR. However, people actually read text character by\ncharacter, especially for ideograms such as Chinese. This raises the question:\nare segmentation-free strategies really the best solution to HCTR? To explore\nthis issue, we propose a new segmentation-based method for recognizing\nhandwritten Chinese text that is implemented using a simple yet efficient fully\nconvolutional network. A novel weakly supervised learning method is proposed to\nenable the network to be trained using only transcript annotations; thus, the\nexpensive character segmentation annotations required by previous\nsegmentation-based methods can be avoided.

While plasma can\nsometimes be modeled as a charged fluid, a kinetic description is useful\ntowards the study of nonlinear effects in the higher dimensional\nmomentum-position phase-space that describes the full complexity of plasma\ndynamics. We create a differentiable solver for the plasma kinetics 3D\npartial-differential-equation and introduce a domain-specific objective\nfunction.

    "abstract": "Background \\& purpose: The recent emergence of neural networks models for the\nanalysis of breast images has been a breakthrough in computer aided diagnostic.\nThis approach was not yet developed in Contrast Enhanced Spectral Mammography\n(CESM) where access to large databases is complex. This work proposes a\ndeep-learning-based Computer Aided Diagnostic development for CESM recombined\nimages able to detect lesions and classify cases. Material \\& methods: A large\nCESM diagnostic dataset with biopsy-proven lesions was collected from various\nhospitals and different acquisition systems. The annotated data were split on a\npatient level for the training (55%), validation (15%) and test (30%) of a deep\nneural network with a state-of-the-art detection architecture. Free Receiver\nOperating Characteristic (FROC) was used to evaluate the model for the\ndetection of 1) all lesions, 2) biopsied lesions and 3) malignant lesions. ROC\ncurve was used to evaluate breast cancer classification. The metrics were\nfinally compared to clinical results. Results: For the evaluation of the\nmalignant lesion detection, at high sensitivity (Se>0.95), the false positive\nrate was at 0.61 per image. For the classification of malignant cases, the\nmodel reached an Area Under the Curve (AUC) in the range of clinical CESM\ndiagnostic results. Conclusion: This CAD is the first development of a lesion\ndetection and classification model for CESM images. Trained on a large dataset,\nit has the potential to be used for helping the management of biopsy decision\nand for helping the radiologist detecting complex lesions that could modify the\nclinical treatment.",

    "abstract": "Optical imaging is commonly used for both scientific and technological\napplications across industry and academia. In image sensing, a measurement,\nsuch as of an object's position, is performed by computational analysis of a\ndigitized image. An emerging image-sensing paradigm breaks this delineation\nbetween data collection and analysis by designing optical components to perform\nnot imaging, but encoding. By optically encoding images into a compressed,\nlow-dimensional latent space suitable for efficient post-analysis, these image\nsensors can operate with fewer pixels and fewer photons, allowing\nhigher-throughput, lower-latency operation. Optical neural networks (ONNs)\noffer a platform for processing data in the analog, optical domain. ONN-based\nsensors have however been limited to linear processing, but nonlinearity is a\nprerequisite for depth, and multilayer NNs significantly outperform shallow NNs\non many tasks. Here, we realize a multilayer ONN pre-processor for image\nsensing, using a commercial image intensifier as a parallel optoelectronic,\noptical-to-optical nonlinear activation function. We demonstrate that the\nnonlinear ONN pre-processor can achieve compression ratios of up to 800:1 while\nstill enabling high accuracy across several representative computer-vision\ntasks, including machine-vision benchmarks, flow-cytometry image\nclassification, and identification of objects in real scenes. In all cases we\nfind that the ONN's nonlinearity and depth allowed it to outperform a purely\nlinear ONN encoder. Although our experiments are specialized to ONN sensors for\nincoherent-light images, alternative ONN platforms should facilitate a range of\nONN sensors. These ONN sensors may surpass conventional sensors by\npre-processing optical information in spatial, temporal, and/or spectral\ndimensions, potentially with coherent and quantum qualities, all natively in\nthe optical domain.",

Currently, the only definitive treatment of preeclampsia is delivery\nof the placenta, which is central to the pathogenesis of the disease.\nTranscriptional profiling of human placenta from pregnancies complicated by\npreeclampsia has been extensively performed to identify differentially\nexpressed genes (DEGs). DEGs are identified using unbiased assays, however, the\ndecisions to investigate DEGs experimentally are biased by many factors,\ncausing many DEGs to remain uninvestigated. A set of DEGs which are associated\nwith a disease experimentally, but which have no known association with the\ndisease in the literature is known as the ignorome. Preeclampsia has an\nextensive body of scientific literature, a large pool of DEG data, and only one\ndefinitive treatment. Tools facilitating knowledge-based analyses, which are\ncapable of combining disparate data from many sources in order to suggest\nunderlying mechanisms of action, may be a valuable resource to support\ndiscovery and improve our understanding of this disease. In this work we\ndemonstrate how a biomedical knowledge graph (KG) can be used to identify novel\npreeclampsia molecular mechanisms. Existing open source biomedical resources\nand publicly available high-throughput transcriptional profiling data were used\nto identify and annotate the function of currently uninvestigated\npreeclampsia-associated DEGs.

    "abstract": "A human is a thing that moves in space. Like all things that move in space,\nwe can in principle use differential equations to describe their motion as a\nset of functions that maps time to position (and velocity, acceleration, and so\non). With inanimate objects, we can reliably predict their trajectories by\nusing differential equations that account for up to the second-order time\nderivative of their position, as is commonly done in analytical mechanics. With\nanimate objects, though, and with humans, in particular, we do not know the\ncardinality of the set of equations that define their trajectory. We may be\ntempted to think, for example, that by reason of their complexity in cognition\nor behaviour as compared to, say, a rock, then the motion of humans requires a\nmore complex description than the one generally used to describe the motion of\nphysical systems. In this paper, we examine a real-world dataset on human\nmobility and consider the information that is added by each (computed, but\ndenoised) additional time derivative, and find the maximum order of derivatives\nof the position that, for that particular dataset, cannot be expressed as a\nlinear transformation of the previous. In this manner, we identify the\ndimensionality of a minimal model that correctly describes the observed\ntrajectories. We find that every higher-order derivative after the acceleration\nis linearly dependent upon one of the previous time-derivatives. This measure\nis robust against noise and the choice for differentiation techniques that we\nuse to compute the time-derivatives numerically as a function of the measured\nposition. This result imposes empirical constraints on the possible sets of\ndifferential equations that can be used to describe the kinematics of a moving\nhuman.",

    "abstract": "In the growing field of virtual auditory display, personalized head-related\ntransfer functions (HRTFs) play a vital role in establishing an accurate sound\nimage. In this work, we propose an HRTF personalization method employing\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict a subject's HRTFs for all\ndirections from their scanned head geometry. To ease the training of the CNN\nmodels, we propose novel pre-processing methods for both the head scans and\nHRTF data to achieve compact representations. For the head scan, we use\ntruncated spherical cap harmonic (SCH) coefficients to represent the pinna\narea, which is important in the acoustic scattering process. For the HRTF data,\nwe use truncated spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients to represent the HRTF\nmagnitudes and onsets. One CNN model is trained to predict the SH coefficients\nof the HRTF magnitudes from the SCH coefficients of the scanned ear geometry\nand other anthropometric measurements of the head. The other CNN model is\ntrained to predict SH coefficients of the HRTF onsets from only the\nanthropometric measurements of the ear, head, and torso. Combining the\nmagnitude and onset predictions, our method is able to predict the complete and\nglobal HRTF data. A leave-one-out validation with the log-spectral distortion\n(LSD) metric is used for objective evaluation. The results show a decent LSD\nlevel at both spatial \\& temporal dimensions compared to the ground-truth HRTFs\nand a lower LSD than the boundary element method (BEM) simulation of HRTFs that\nthe database provides. The localization simulation results with an auditory\nmodel are also consistent with the objective evaluation metrics, showing the\nlocalization responses with our predicted HRTFs are significantly better than\nwith the BEM calculated ones.",

To locate, fix and\ncompute the free-boundary simultaneously with option and delta sensitivity, we\nintroduce a Landau transformation. Furthermore, we remove the convective term\nin the pricing model which could further introduce errors. Hence, an efficient\nsixth-order compact scheme can easily be implemented. The main challenge in\ncoupling the sixth order compact scheme in discrete form is to efficiently\naccount for the near-boundary scheme. In this work, we introduce novel fifth-\nand sixth-order Dirichlet near-boundary schemes suitable for solving our model.\nThe optimal exercise boundary and other boundary values are approximated using\na high-order analytical approximation obtained from a novel fifth-order\nstaggered boundary scheme. Furthermore, we investigate the smoothness of the\nfirst and second derivatives of the optimal exercise boundary which is obtained\nfrom this high-order analytical approximation. Coupled with the 3(2) RK-Bogacki\nand Shampine time integration method, the interior values are then approximated\nusing the sixth order compact operator.

Unfortunately, these neural networks are\nconsidered black-box algorithms, i.e. it is impossible to understand how the\nalgorithm has achieved the final result.

The main contribution of this\npaper is a Deep Learning methodology for imbalanced, multilabel chest X-ray\ndatasets. It establishes a baseline for the currently underutilised PadChest\ndataset and a new eXplainable AI technique based on heatmaps. This technique\nalso includes probabilities and inter-model matching.

We first revisit a known lower bound due to Haah et al.\n(2017) on quantum tomography with accuracy $\\epsilon$ in trace distance, when\nthe measurements choices are independent of previously observed outcomes (i.e.,\nthey are nonadaptive). We give a succinct proof of this result. This leads to\nstronger lower bounds when the learner uses measurements with a constant number\nof outcomes. In particular, this rigorously establishes the optimality of the\nfolklore ``Pauli tomography\" algorithm in terms of its sample complexity. We\nalso derive novel bounds of $\\Omega(r^2 d/\\epsilon^2)$ and $\\Omega(r^2\nd^2/\\epsilon^2)$ for learning rank $r$ states using arbitrary and\nconstant-outcome measurements, respectively, in the nonadaptive case.\nIn addition to the sample complexity, a resource of practical significance\nfor learning quantum states is the number of different measurements used by an\nalgorithm. We extend our lower bounds to the case where the learner performs\npossibly adaptive measurements from a fixed set of $\\exp(O(d))$ measurements.\nThis implies in particular that adaptivity does not give us any advantage using\nsingle-copy measurements that are efficiently implementable. We also obtain a\nsimilar bound in the case where the goal is to predict the expectation values\nof a given sequence of observables, a task known as shadow tomography.

Most of the available deep learning-based pan-sharpening methods\nsharpen the multispectral images through a one-step scheme, which strongly\ndepends on the reconstruction ability of the network. However, remote sensing\nimages always have large variations, as a result, these one-step methods are\nvulnerable to the error accumulation and thus incapable of preserving spatial\ndetails as well as the spectral information. In this paper, we propose a novel\ntwo-step model for pan-sharpening that sharpens the MS image through the\nprogressive compensation of the spatial and spectral information. Firstly, a\ndeep multiscale guided generative adversarial network is used to preliminarily\nenhance the spatial resolution of the MS image. Starting from the pre-sharpened\nMS image in the coarse domain, our approach then progressively refines the\nspatial and spectral residuals over a couple of generative adversarial networks\n(GANs) that have reverse architectures. The whole model is composed of triple\nGANs, and based on the specific architecture, a joint compensation loss\nfunction is designed to enable the triple GANs to be trained simultaneously.\nMoreover, the spatial-spectral residual compensation structure proposed in this\npaper can be extended to other pan-sharpening methods to further enhance their\nfusion results. Extensive experiments are performed on different datasets and\nthe results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed\nmethod.",

    "abstract": "Suppose that $K_n$ is the complete graph on vertex set $[n]$, and $\\D$ is a\ndistribution on subsets of its edges. The $\\mathcal{D}$-adaptive random graph\nprocess (or $\\mathcal{D}$-process) is a single player game in which the player\nis initially presented the empty graph on $[n]$. In each step, a subset of\nedges of $K_n$, say $X$, is independently sampled from $\\mathcal{D}$ and\npresented to the player. The player then adaptively selects precisely one edge\n$e$ from $X$, and adds $e$ to its current graph. For a fixed (edge) monotone\ngraph property, the objective of the player is to force the graph to satisfy\nthe property in as few steps as possible. Through appropriate choices of\n$\\mathcal{D}$, the $\\mathcal{D}$-process generalizes well-studied adaptive\nprocesses, such as the Achlioptas process and the semi-random graph process.\nWe prove a theorem which gives a sufficient condition for the existence of a\nsharp threshold for the property $\\mathcal{P}$ in the $\\mathcal{D}$-process. We\napply our theorem to the semi-random graph process and prove the existence of a\nsharp threshold when $\\mathcal{P}$ corresponds to being Hamiltonian or to\ncontaining a perfect matching. These are the first results for the semi-random\ngraph process which show the existence of a sharp threshold when $\\mathcal{P}$\ncorresponds to containing a \\textit{sparse} spanning graph. Using a separate\nanalytic argument, we show that each sharp threshold is of the form\n$C_{\\mathcal{P}}n$ for some fixed constant $C_{\\mathcal{P}}>0$. This answers\ntwo of the open problems proposed by Ben-Eliezer et al. (SODA 2020) in the\naffirmative. Unlike similar results which establish sharp thresholds for\ncertain distributions and properties, we establish the existence of sharp\nthresholds without explicitly identifying asymptotically optimal strategies.",

    "abstract": "Automatic tumor or lesion segmentation is a crucial step in medical image\nanalysis for computer-aided diagnosis. Although the existing methods based on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved the state-of-the-art\nperformance, many challenges still remain in medical tumor segmentation. This\nis because, although the human visual system can detect symmetries in 2D images\neffectively, regular CNNs can only exploit translation invariance, overlooking\nfurther inherent symmetries existing in medical images such as rotations and\nreflections. To solve this problem, we propose a novel group equivariant\nsegmentation framework by encoding those inherent symmetries for learning more\nprecise representations. First, kernel-based equivariant operations are devised\non each orientation, which allows it to effectively address the gaps of\nlearning symmetries in existing approaches. Then, to keep segmentation networks\nglobally equivariant, we design distinctive group layers with layer-wise\nsymmetry constraints. Finally, based on our novel framework, extensive\nexperiments conducted on real-world clinical data demonstrate that a Group\nEquivariant Res-UNet (named GER-UNet) outperforms its regular CNN-based\ncounterpart and the state-of-the-art segmentation methods in the tasks of\nhepatic tumor segmentation, COVID-19 lung infection segmentation and retinal\nvessel detection. More importantly, the newly built GER-UNet also shows\npotential in reducing the sample complexity and the redundancy of filters,\nupgrading current segmentation CNNs and delineating organs on other medical\nimaging modalities.",

    "abstract": "The encoder-decoder model is a commonly used Deep Neural Network (DNN) model\nfor medical image segmentation. Conventional encoder-decoder models make\npixel-wise predictions focusing heavily on local patterns around the pixel.\nThis makes it challenging to give segmentation that preserves the object's\nshape and topology, which often requires an understanding of the global context\nof the object. In this work, we propose a Fourier Coefficient Segmentation\nNetwork~(FCSN) -- a novel DNN-based model that segments an object by learning\nthe complex Fourier coefficients of the object's masks. The Fourier\ncoefficients are calculated by integrating over the whole contour. Therefore,\nfor our model to make a precise estimation of the coefficients, the model is\nmotivated to incorporate the global context of the object, leading to a more\naccurate segmentation of the object's shape. This global context awareness also\nmakes our model robust to unseen local perturbations during inference, such as\nadditive noise or motion blur that are prevalent in medical images. When FCSN\nis compared with other state-of-the-art models (UNet+, DeepLabV3+, UNETR) on 3\nmedical image segmentation tasks (ISIC\\_2018, RIM\\_CUP, RIM\\_DISC), FCSN\nattains significantly lower Hausdorff scores of 19.14 (6\\%), 17.42 (6\\%), and\n9.16 (14\\%) on the 3 tasks, respectively. Moreover, FCSN is lightweight by\ndiscarding the decoder module, which incurs significant computational overhead.\nFCSN only requires 22.2M parameters, 82M and 10M fewer parameters than UNETR\nand DeepLabV3+. FCSN attains inference and training speeds of 1.6ms/img and\n6.3ms/img, that is 8$\\times$ and 3$\\times$ faster than UNet and UNETR.",

We propose a transition path sampling scheme based on neural-network\ngenerated configurations. These are obtained employing normalizing flows, a\nneural network class able to generate decorrelated samples from a given\ndistribution. With this approach, not only are correlations between visited\npaths removed, but the sampling process becomes easily parallelizable.\nMoreover, by conditioning the normalizing flow, the sampling of configurations\ncan be steered towards the regions of interest.

    "abstract": "Enhanced sampling methods are indispensable in computational physics and\nchemistry, where atomistic simulations cannot exhaustively sample the\nhigh-dimensional configuration space of dynamical systems due to the sampling\nproblem. A class of such enhanced sampling methods works by identifying a few\nslow degrees of freedom, termed collective variables (CVs), and enhancing the\nsampling along these CVs. Selecting CVs to analyze and drive the sampling is\nnot trivial and often relies on physical and chemical intuition. Despite\nroutinely circumventing this issue using manifold learning to estimate CVs\ndirectly from standard simulations, such methods cannot provide mappings to a\nlow-dimensional manifold from enhanced sampling simulations as the geometry and\ndensity of the learned manifold are biased. Here, we address this crucial issue\nand provide a general reweighting framework based on anisotropic diffusion maps\nfor manifold learning that takes into account that the learning data set is\nsampled from a biased probability distribution. We consider manifold learning\nmethods based on constructing a Markov chain describing transition\nprobabilities between high-dimensional samples. We show that our framework\nreverts the biasing effect yielding CVs that correctly describe the equilibrium\ndensity.

Summarizing\nlarge graphs by their high level properties is helpful in solving problems in\nthese settings. In spectral clustering, we aim to identify clusters of nodes\nwhere most edges fall within clusters and only few edges fall between clusters.\nThis task is important for many downstream applications and exploratory\nanalysis. A core step of spectral clustering is performing an\neigendecomposition of the corresponding graph Laplacian matrix (or\nequivalently, a singular value decomposition, SVD, of the incidence matrix).\nThe convergence of iterative singular value decomposition approaches depends on\nthe eigengaps of the spectrum of the given matrix, i.e., the difference between\nconsecutive eigenvalues. For a graph Laplacian corresponding to a\nwell-clustered graph, the eigenvalues will be non-negative but very small (much\nless than $1$) slowing convergence. This paper introduces a parallelizable\napproach to dilating the spectrum in order to accelerate SVD solvers and in\nturn, spectral clustering. This is accomplished via polynomial approximations\nto matrix operations that favorably transform the spectrum of a matrix without\nchanging its eigenvectors. Experiments demonstrate that this approach\nsignificantly accelerates convergence, and we explain how this transformation\ncan be parallelized and stochastically approximated to scale with available\ncompute.",

    "abstract": "A methodological framework for ensemble-based estimation and simulation of\nhigh dimensional dynamical systems such as the oceanic or atmospheric flows is\nproposed. To that end, the dynamical system is embedded in a family of\nreproducing kernel Hilbert spaces with kernel functions driven by the dynamics.\nThis family is nicknamed Wonderland for its appealing properties. In Wonderland\nthe Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators are unitary and uniformly\ncontinuous. This property warrants they can be expressed in exponential series\nof diagonalizable bounded infinitesimal generators. Access to Lyapunov\nexponents and to exact ensemble based expressions of the tangent linear\ndynamics are directly available as well. Wonderland enables us the devise of\nstrikingly simple ensemble data assimilation methods for trajectory\nreconstructions in terms of constant-in-time linear combinations of trajectory\nsamples. Such an embarrassingly simple strategy is made possible through a\nfully justified superposition principle ensuing from several fundamental\ntheorems.",

    "abstract": "Personalised 3D vascular models are valuable for diagnosis, prognosis and\ntreatment planning in patients with cardiovascular disease. Traditionally, such\nmodels have been constructed with explicit representations such as meshes and\nvoxel masks, or implicit representations such as radial basis functions or\natomic (tubular) shapes. Here, we propose to represent surfaces by the zero\nlevel set of their signed distance function (SDF) in a differentiable implicit\nneural representation (INR). This allows us to model complex vascular\nstructures with a representation that is implicit, continuous, light-weight,\nand easy to integrate with deep learning algorithms. We here demonstrate the\npotential of this approach with three practical examples. First, we obtain an\naccurate and watertight surface for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) from CT\nimages and show robust fitting from as little as 200 points on the surface.\nSecond, we simultaneously fit nested vessel walls in a single INR without\nintersections. Third, we show how 3D models of individual arteries can be\nsmoothly blended into a single watertight surface. Our results show that INRs\nare a flexible representation with potential for minimally interactive\nannotation and manipulation of complex vascular structures.",

    "abstract": "Since 2015, the United Nations have called for a global effort to reach\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Firms play a vital role in contributing\nto SDGs. While many empirical approaches were used to map firms' contributions\nto SDGs, online social networks are an underexplored but promising setting.\nThis paper maps large UK firms' discussions on Twitter, specifically focusing\non their SDG-related discussions, with complex network methods from statistical\nphysics. Results show that: 1) SDGs are the topics that tie conversations among\nmajor UK firms together; 2) compared to the environmental and economic\ndimensions, the social dimension is predominant; 3) the attention to different\nSDGs varies depending on the community and sector firms belong to; 4) the use\nof retweets on SDGs-related tweets highlights a high stakeholder engagement on\nglobal challenges; 5) large UK companies and stakeholders generally behave\ndifferently from Italian ones. This paper provides theoretical contributions,\ncombining institutional, stakeholder and legitimacy theories. It also\ncontributes to developing the literature on businesses and SDGs with an\ninterdisciplinary approach. It offers practical implications and a big-data\nbased tool to monitor firms' discussions on SDGs on Twitter. Last, the paper\nproposes new avenues for further research.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To create and evaluate the accuracy of an artificial intelligence\nDeep learning platform (ORAiCLE) capable of using only retinal fundus images to\npredict both an individuals overall 5 year cardiovascular risk (CVD) and the\nrelative contribution of the component risk factors that comprise this risk.\nMethods: We used 165,907 retinal images from a database of 47,236 patient\nvisits. Initially, each image was paired with biometric data age, ethnicity,\nsex, presence and duration of diabetes a HDL/LDL ratios as well as any CVD\nevent wtihin 5 years of the retinal image acquisition. A risk score based on\nFramingham equations was calculated. The real CVD event rate was also\ndetermined for the individuals and overall population. Finally, ORAiCLE was\ntrained using only age, ethnicity, sex plus retinal images. Results: Compared\nto Framingham-based score, ORAiCLE was up to 12% more accurate in prediciting\ncardiovascular event in he next 5-years, especially for the highest risk group\nof people. The reliability and accuracy of each of the restrictive models was\nsuboptimal to ORAiCLE performance ,indicating that it was using data from both\nsets of data to derive its final results. Conclusion: Retinal photography is\ninexpensive and only minimal training is required to acquire them as fully\nautomated, inexpensive camera systems are now widely available. As such,\nAI-based CVD risk algorithms such as ORAiCLE promise to make CV health\nscreening more accurate, more afforadable and more accessible for all.\nFurthermore, ORAiCLE unique ability to assess the relative contribution of the\ncomponents that comprise an individuals overall risk would inform treatment\ndecisions based on the specific needs of an individual, thereby increasing the\nlikelihood of positive health outcomes.",

One approach to improve\nsmall lesion segmentation is to reduce the region of interest and inspect it at\na higher sensitivity rather than performing it for the entire region. It is\nusually implemented as sequential or joint segmentation of organ and lesion,\nwhich requires additional supervision on organ segmentation. Instead, we\npropose to utilize an intensity distribution of a target lesion at no\nadditional labeling cost to effectively separate regions where the lesions are\npossibly located from the background.

    "abstract": "Purpose: It has been challenging to recover QSM in the presence of phase\nerrors, which could be caused by the noise or strong local susceptibility\nshifts in cases of brain hemorrhage and calcification. We propose a Bayesian\nformulation for QSM where a two-component Gaussian-mixture distribution is used\nto model the long-tailed noise (error) distribution, and design an approximate\nmessage passing (AMP) algorithm with automatic and adaptive parameter\nestimation.\nTheory: Wavelet coefficients of the susceptibility map follow the Laplace\ndistribution. The measurement noise follows a two-component Gaussian-mixture\ndistribution where the second Gaussian component models the noise outliers. The\ndistribution parameters are treated as unknown variables and jointly recovered\nwith the susceptibility using AMP.\nMethods: The proposed AMP with parameter estimation (AMP-PE) is compared with\nthe state-of-the-art nonlinear L1-QSM and MEDI approaches that adopt the\nL1-norm and L2-norm data-fidelity terms respectively. The three approaches are\ntested on the Sim2Snr1 data from QSM challenge 2.0, the in vivo data from both\nhealthy and hemorrhage scans.\nResults: On the simulated Sim2Snr1 dataset, AMP-PE achieved the lowest NRMSE\nand SSIM, MEDI achieved the lowest HFEN, and each approach also has its own\nstrong suit when it comes to various local evaluation metrics. On the in vivo\ndataset, AMP-PE is better at preserving structural details and removing\nstreaking artifacts than L1-QSM and MEDI.\nConclusion: By leveraging a customized Gaussian-mixture noise prior, AMP-PE\nachieves better performance on the challenging QSM cases involving hemorrhage\nand calcification. It is equipped with built-in parameter estimation, which\navoids subjective bias from the usual visual fine-tuning step of in vivo\nreconstruction.",

An atomic\nstructure of a material can be identified by its diffraction pattern, along\nwith detailed analysis such as Rietveld refinement which indicates how the\nmeasured structure deviates from the ideal structure (e.g., internal stresses\nor defects). For in situ experiments, a series of XRD images is usually\ncollected on the same sample at different conditions (e.g., adiabatic\nconditions), yielding different states of matter, or simply collected\ncontinuously as a function of time to track the change of a sample over a\nchemical or physical process. In situ experiments are usually performed with\narea detectors, collecting 2D images composed of diffraction rings for ideal\npowders. Depending on the material's form, one may observe different\ncharacteristics other than the typical Debye Scherrer rings for a realistic\nsample and its environments, such as textures or preferred orientations and\nsingle crystal diffraction spots in the 2D XRD image.
