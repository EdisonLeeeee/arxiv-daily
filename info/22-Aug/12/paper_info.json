    "abstract": "One of the biggest problems of vehicular ad-hoc networks is revocation. The\nefficient management of such issue has become one of the major paradigms in\nthis area of research. A solution proposed here is based on the use of\nauthenticated data structures like revocation trees to replace the classical\nand inefficient certificate revocation lists. In particular, the idea of this\npaper is to propose the use of k-ary hash trees, Huffman coding and a duplex\nversion of the SHA-3 hash function, to optimize insertions and searches in the\nrevocation structure. Thus, the inclusion of a new certificate revoked in the\ntree, only implies a new iteration of the duplex construction of the hash\nfunction, avoiding recalculating the entire hashes and the entire tree.\nFurthermore, a k-ary Huffman tree is used to insert leaf nodes at different\nlevels so that those revoked nodes that are more queried, are located closer to\nthe root node position, so the revocation proof is smaller for those vehicles\nthat spend more time on the roads. This paper details a method to calculate the\noptimum value $k$ for the k-ary tree in order to optimize the revocation proof\nsize. Therefore, the proposal described here improves both the insertion of new\nrevoked certificates in the revocation structure and the search of revoked\ncertificates in the revocation structure. This paper is part of a work in\nprogress, so that we plan to implement the scheme in real scenarios to get\nideal values of the parameters and comparisons with other schemes.",

    "abstract": "Malicious software (malware) causes much harm to our devices and life. We are\neager to understand the malware behavior and the threat it made. Most of the\nrecord files of malware are variable length and text-based files with time\nstamps, such as event log data and dynamic analysis profiles. Using the time\nstamps, we can sort such data into sequence-based data for the following\nanalysis. However, dealing with the text-based sequences with variable lengths\nis difficult. In addition, unlike natural language text data, most sequential\ndata in information security have specific properties and structure, such as\nloop, repeated call, noise, etc. To deeply analyze the API call sequences with\ntheir structure, we use graphs to represent the sequences, which can further\ninvestigate the information and structure, such as the Markov model. Therefore,\nwe design and implement an Attention Aware Graph Neural Network (AWGCN) to\nanalyze the API call sequences. Through AWGCN, we can obtain the sequence\nembeddings to analyze the behavior of the malware. Moreover, the classification\nexperiment result shows that AWGCN outperforms other classifiers in the\ncall-like datasets, and the embedding can further improve the classic model's\nperformance.",

This paper describes a compositional approach to specifying the\nnodes in robotic systems built using the Robotic Operating System (ROS), where\neach node is specified using First-Order Logic (FOL) assume-guarantee contracts\nthat link the specification to the ROS implementation. We introduce inference\nrules that facilitate the composition of these node-level contracts to derive\nsystem-level properties. We also present a novel Domain-Specific Language, the\nRCL, which captures a node's FOL specification and links this contract to its\nimplementation. ROS Contract Language (RCL) contracts can be automatically\ntranslated, by our tool Vanda, into executable monitors; which we use to\nenforce the contracts at runtime.

    "abstract": "Neural Collapse refers to the remarkable structural properties characterizing\nthe geometry of class embeddings and classifier weights, found by deep nets\nwhen trained beyond zero training error. However, this characterization only\nholds for balanced data. Here we thus ask whether it can be made invariant to\nclass imbalances. Towards this end, we adopt the unconstrained-features model\n(UFM), a recent theoretical model for studying neural collapse, and introduce\nSimplex-Encoded-Labels Interpolation (SELI) as an invariant characterization of\nthe neural collapse phenomenon. Specifically, we prove for the UFM with\ncross-entropy loss and vanishing regularization that, irrespective of class\nimbalances, the embeddings and classifiers always interpolate a simplex-encoded\nlabel matrix and that their individual geometries are determined by the SVD\nfactors of this same label matrix. We then present extensive experiments on\nsynthetic and real datasets that confirm convergence to the SELI geometry.\nHowever, we caution that convergence worsens with increasing imbalances. We\ntheoretically support this finding by showing that unlike the balanced case,\nwhen minorities are present, ridge-regularization plays a critical role in\ntweaking the geometry. This defines new questions and motivates further\ninvestigations into the impact of class imbalances on the rates at which\nfirst-order methods converge to their asymptotically preferred solutions.",

    "abstract": "Graph edge perturbations are dedicated to damaging the prediction of graph\nneural networks by modifying the graph structure. Previous gray-box attackers\nemploy gradients from the surrogate model to locate the vulnerable edges to\nperturb the graph structure. However, unreliability exists in gradients on\ngraph structures, which is rarely studied by previous works. In this paper, we\ndiscuss and analyze the errors caused by the unreliability of the structural\ngradients. These errors arise from rough gradient usage due to the discreteness\nof the graph structure and from the unreliability in the meta-gradient on the\ngraph structure. In order to address these problems, we propose a novel attack\nmodel with methods to reduce the errors inside the structural gradients. We\npropose edge discrete sampling to select the edge perturbations associated with\nhierarchical candidate selection to ensure computational efficiency. In\naddition, semantic invariance and momentum gradient ensemble are proposed to\naddress the gradient fluctuation on semantic-augmented graphs and the\ninstability of the surrogate model. Experiments are conducted in untargeted\ngray-box poisoning scenarios and demonstrate the improvement in the performance\nof our approach.",

In this\nwork, we introduce a testbed of six publicly available data sources - YFCC,\nLAION, Conceptual Captions, WIT, RedCaps, Shutterstock - to investigate how\npre-training distributions induce robustness in CLIP. We find that the\nperformance of the pre-training data varies substantially across distribution\nshifts, with no single data source dominating. Moreover, we systematically\nstudy the interactions between these data sources and find that combining\nmultiple sources does not necessarily yield better models, but rather dilutes\nthe robustness of the best individual data source. We complement our empirical\nfindings with theoretical insights from a simple setting, where combining the\ntraining data also results in diluted robustness. In addition, our theoretical\nmodel provides a candidate explanation for the success of the CLIP-based data\nfiltering technique recently employed in the LAION dataset.

    "abstract": "Refractive error is the most common eye disorder and is the key cause behind\ncorrectable visual impairment, responsible for nearly 80% of the visual\nimpairment in the US. Refractive error can be diagnosed using multiple methods,\nincluding subjective refraction, retinoscopy, and autorefractors. Although\nsubjective refraction is the gold standard, it requires cooperation from the\npatient and hence is not suitable for infants, young children, and\ndevelopmentally delayed adults. Retinoscopy is an objective refraction method\nthat does not require any input from the patient. However, retinoscopy requires\na lens kit and a trained examiner, which limits its use for mass screening. In\nthis work, we automate retinoscopy by attaching a smartphone to a retinoscope\nand recording retinoscopic videos with the patient wearing a custom pair of\npaper frames. We develop a video processing pipeline that takes retinoscopic\nvideos as input and estimates the net refractive error based on our proposed\nextension of the retinoscopy mathematical model. Our system alleviates the need\nfor a lens kit and can be performed by an untrained examiner. In a clinical\ntrial with 185 eyes, we achieved a sensitivity of 91.0% and specificity of\n74.0% on refractive error diagnosis. Moreover, the mean absolute error of our\napproach was 0.75$\\pm$0.67D on net refractive error estimation compared to\nsubjective refraction measurements.

    "abstract": "Emerging intelligent transportation applications, such as accident reporting,\nlane change assistance, collision avoidance, and infotainment, will be based on\ndiverse requirements (e.g., latency, reliability, quality of physical\nexperience). To fulfill such requirements, there is a significant need to\ndeploy a digital twin-based intelligent transportation system. Although the\ntwin-based implementation of vehicular networks can offer performance\noptimization. Modeling twins is a significantly challenging task. Machine\nlearning (ML) can be a preferable solution to model such a virtual model, and\nspecifically federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning scheme that can\nbetter preserve privacy compared to centralized ML. Although FL can offer\nperformance enhancement, it requires careful design. Therefore, in this\narticle, we present an overview of FL for the twin-based vehicular network. A\ngeneral architecture showing FL for the twin-based vehicular network is\nproposed. Our proposed architecture consists of two spaces, such as twin space\nand a physical space. The physical space consists of all the physical entities\n(e.g., cars and edge servers) required for vehicular networks, whereas the twin\nspace refers to the logical space that is used for the deployment of twins. A\ntwin space can be implemented either using edge servers and cloud servers. We\nalso outline a few use cases of FL for the twin-based vehicular network.\nFinally, the paper is concluded and an outlook on open challenges is presented.",

    "abstract": "Communicating state machines provide a formal foundation for distributed\ncomputation. Unfortunately, they are Turing-complete and, thus, challenging to\nanalyse. In this paper, we classify restrictions on channels which have been\nproposed to work around the undecidability of verification questions. We\ncompare half-duplex communication, existential B-boundedness, and\nk-synchronisability. These restrictions do not prevent the communication\nchannels from growing arbitrarily large but still restrict the power of the\nmodel. Each restriction gives rise to a set of languages so, for every pair of\nrestrictions, we check whether one subsumes the other or if they are\nincomparable. We investigate their relationship in two different contexts:\nfirst, the one of communicating state machines, and, second, the one of\ncommunication protocol specifications using high-level message sequence charts.\nSurprisingly, these two contexts yield different conclusions. In addition, we\nintegrate multiparty session types, another approach to specify communication\nprotocols, into our classification. We show that multiparty session type\nlanguages are half-duplex, existentially 1-bounded, and 1-synchronisable.\nTo~show this result, we provide the first formal embedding of multiparty\nsession types into high-level message sequence charts.",

    "abstract": "Clustering analysis is one of the critical tasks in machine learning.\nTraditionally, clustering has been an independent task, separate from outlier\ndetection. Due to the fact that the performance of clustering can be\nsignificantly eroded by outliers, a small number of algorithms try to\nincorporate outlier detection in the process of clustering. However, most of\nthose algorithms are based on unsupervised partition-based algorithms such as\nk-means. Given the nature of those algorithms, they often fail to deal with\nclusters of complex, non-convex shapes. To tackle this challenge, we have\nproposed SSDBCODI, a semi-supervised density-based algorithm. SSDBCODI combines\nthe advantage of density-based algorithms, which are capable of dealing with\nclusters of complex shapes, with the semi-supervised element, which offers\nflexibility to adjust the clustering results based on a few user labels. We\nalso merge an outlier detection component with the clustering process.\nPotential outliers are detected based on three scores generated during the\nprocess: (1) reachability-score, which measures how density-reachable a point\nis to a labeled normal object, (2) local-density-score, which measures the\nneighboring density of data objects, and (3) similarity-score, which measures\nthe closeness of a point to its nearest labeled outliers. Then in the following\nstep, instance weights are generated for each data instance based on those\nthree scores before being used to train a classifier for further clustering and\noutlier detection. To enhance the understanding of the proposed algorithm, for\nour evaluation, we have run our proposed algorithm against some of the\nstate-of-art approaches on multiple datasets and separately listed the results\nof outlier detection apart from clustering. Our results indicate that our\nalgorithm can achieve superior results with a small percentage of labels.",

Successful groups employ\nsubstantial specialization and division of labor. Unlike most other animals,\nhumans learn by trial and error during their lives what role to take on.\nHowever, when some critical roles are more attractive than others, and\nindividuals are self-interested, then there is a social dilemma: each\nindividual would prefer others take on the critical-but-unremunerative roles so\nthey may remain free to take one that pays better. But disaster occurs if all\nact thusly and a critical role goes unfilled. In such situations learning an\noptimum role distribution may not be possible. Consequently, a fundamental\nquestion is: how can division of labor emerge in groups of self-interested\nlifetime-learning individuals? Here we show that by introducing a model of\nsocial norms, which we regard as patterns of decentralized social sanctioning,\nit becomes possible for groups of self-interested individuals to learn a\nproductive division of labor involving all critical roles.

    "abstract": "Fingerprint evidence plays an important role in a criminal investigation for\nthe identification of individuals. Although various techniques have been\nproposed for fingerprint classification and feature extraction, automated\nfingerprint identification of fingerprints is still in its earliest stage. The\nperformance of traditional \\textit{Automatic Fingerprint Identification System}\n(AFIS) depends on the presence of valid minutiae points and still requires\nhuman expert assistance in feature extraction and identification stages. Based\non this motivation, we propose a Fingerprint Identification approach based on\nGenerative adversarial network and One-shot learning techniques (FIGO). Our\nsolution contains two components: fingerprint enhancement tier and fingerprint\nidentification tier. First, we propose a Pix2Pix model to transform low-quality\nfingerprint images to a higher level of fingerprint images pixel by pixel\ndirectly in the fingerprint enhancement tier. With the proposed enhancement\nalgorithm, the fingerprint identification model's performance is significantly\nimproved. Furthermore, we develop another existing solution based on Gabor\nfilters as a benchmark to compare with the proposed model by observing the\nfingerprint device's recognition accuracy. Experimental results show that our\nproposed Pix2pix model has better support than the baseline approach for\nfingerprint identification. Second, we construct a fully automated fingerprint\nfeature extraction model using a one-shot learning approach to differentiate\neach fingerprint from the others in the fingerprint identification process. Two\ntwin convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with shared weights and parameters\nare used to obtain the feature vectors in this process.

    "abstract": "Recent works on language-guided image manipulation have shown great power of\nlanguage in providing rich semantics, especially for face images. However, the\nother natural information, motions, in language is less explored. In this\npaper, we leverage the motion information and study a novel task,\nlanguage-guided face animation, that aims to animate a static face image with\nthe help of languages. To better utilize both semantics and motions from\nlanguages, we propose a simple yet effective framework. Specifically, we\npropose a recurrent motion generator to extract a series of semantic and motion\ninformation from the language and feed it along with visual information to a\npre-trained StyleGAN to generate high-quality frames. To optimize the proposed\nframework, three carefully designed loss functions are proposed including a\nregularization loss to keep the face identity, a path length regularization\nloss to ensure motion smoothness, and a contrastive loss to enable video\nsynthesis with various language guidance in one single model. Extensive\nexperiments with both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on diverse\ndomains (\\textit{e.g.,} human face, anime face, and dog face) demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our model in generating high-quality and realistic videos from\none still image with the guidance of language.

    "abstract": "Cross-modal fashion image synthesis has emerged as one of the most promising\ndirections in the generation domain due to the vast untapped potential of\nincorporating multiple modalities and the wide range of fashion image\napplications. To facilitate accurate generation, cross-modal synthesis methods\ntypically rely on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to align\ntextual and garment information. In this work, we argue that simply aligning\ntexture and garment information is not sufficient to capture the semantics of\nthe visual information and therefore propose MaskCLIP. MaskCLIP decomposes the\ngarments into semantic parts, ensuring fine-grained and semantically accurate\nalignment between the visual and text information. Building on MaskCLIP, we\npropose ARMANI, a unified cross-modal fashion designer with part-level\ngarment-text alignment. ARMANI discretizes an image into uniform tokens based\non a learned cross-modal codebook in its first stage and uses a Transformer to\nmodel the distribution of image tokens for a real image given the tokens of the\ncontrol signals in its second stage. Contrary to prior approaches that also\nrely on two-stage paradigms, ARMANI introduces textual tokens into the\ncodebook, making it possible for the model to utilize fine-grain semantic\ninformation to generate more realistic images. Further, by introducing a\ncross-modal Transformer, ARMANI is versatile and can accomplish image synthesis\nfrom various control signals, such as pure text, sketch images, and partial\nimages. Extensive experiments conducted on our newly collected cross-modal\nfashion dataset demonstrate that ARMANI generates photo-realistic images in\ndiverse synthesis tasks and outperforms existing state-of-the-art cross-modal\nimage synthesis approaches.Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Harvey594/ARMANI.",

To address the above issues in the distributed model\ntraining setting which has high computation efficiency and less device\nlimitation, there are still two main difficulties. On one hand, the\ncommunication costs for exchanging information, e.g., stochastic gradients\namong different workers, is a key bottleneck for distributed training\nefficiency. On the other hand, less parameter model is easy for storage and\ncommunication, but the risk of damaging the model performance. To balance the\ncommunication costs, model capacity and model performance simultaneously, we\npropose quantized composite mirror descent adaptive subgradient (QCMD adagrad)\nand quantized regularized dual average adaptive subgradient (QRDA adagrad) for\ndistributed training. To be specific, we explore the combination of gradient\nquantization and sparse model to reduce the communication cost per iteration in\ndistributed training. A quantized gradient-based adaptive learning rate matrix\nis constructed to achieve a balance between communication costs, accuracy, and\nmodel sparsity. Moreover, we theoretically find that a large quantization error\nbrings in extra noise, which influences the convergence and sparsity of the\nmodel. Therefore, a threshold quantization strategy with a relatively small\nerror is adopted in QCMD adagrad and QRDA adagrad to improve the\nsignal-to-noise ratio and preserve the sparsity of the model.

    "title": "PPMN: Pixel-Phrase Matching Network for One-Stage Panoptic Narrative  Grounding",
    "abstract": "Panoptic Narrative Grounding (PNG) is an emerging task whose goal is to\nsegment visual objects of things and stuff categories described by dense\nnarrative captions of a still image. The previous two-stage approach first\nextracts segmentation region proposals by an off-the-shelf panoptic\nsegmentation model, then conducts coarse region-phrase matching to ground the\ncandidate regions for each noun phrase. However, the two-stage pipeline usually\nsuffers from the performance limitation of low-quality proposals in the first\nstage and the loss of spatial details caused by region feature pooling, as well\nas complicated strategies designed for things and stuff categories separately.\nTo alleviate these drawbacks, we propose a one-stage end-to-end Pixel-Phrase\nMatching Network (PPMN), which directly matches each phrase to its\ncorresponding pixels instead of region proposals and outputs panoptic\nsegmentation by simple combination. Thus, our model can exploit sufficient and\nfiner cross-modal semantic correspondence from the supervision of densely\nannotated pixel-phrase pairs rather than sparse region-phrase pairs. In\naddition, we also propose a Language-Compatible Pixel Aggregation (LCPA) module\nto further enhance the discriminative ability of phrase features through\nmulti-round refinement, which selects the most compatible pixels for each\nphrase to adaptively aggregate the corresponding visual context. Extensive\nexperiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on\nthe PNG benchmark with 4.0 absolute Average Recall gains.",

    "title": "Embedding Compression with Hashing for Efficient Representation Learning  in Large-Scale Graph",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are deep learning models designed specifically\nfor graph data, and they typically rely on node features as the input to the\nfirst layer. When applying such a type of network on the graph without node\nfeatures, one can extract simple graph-based node features (e.g., number of\ndegrees) or learn the input node representations (i.e., embeddings) when\ntraining the network. While the latter approach, which trains node embeddings,\nmore likely leads to better performance, the number of parameters associated\nwith the embeddings grows linearly with the number of nodes. It is therefore\nimpractical to train the input node embeddings together with GNNs within\ngraphics processing unit (GPU) memory in an end-to-end fashion when dealing\nwith industrial-scale graph data. Inspired by the embedding compression methods\ndeveloped for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, we develop a node\nembedding compression method where each node is compactly represented with a\nbit vector instead of a floating-point vector. The parameters utilized in the\ncompression method can be trained together with GNNs. We show that the proposed\nnode embedding compression method achieves superior performance compared to the\nalternatives.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks with improved transferability - the ability of an\nadversarial example crafted on a known model to also fool unknown models - have\nrecently received much attention due to their practicality. Nevertheless,\nexisting transferable attacks craft perturbations in a deterministic manner and\noften fail to fully explore the loss surface, thus falling into a poor local\noptimum and suffering from low transferability. To solve this problem, we\npropose Attentive-Diversity Attack (ADA), which disrupts diverse salient\nfeatures in a stochastic manner to improve transferability. Primarily, we\nperturb the image attention to disrupt universal features shared by different\nmodels. Then, to effectively avoid poor local optima, we disrupt these features\nin a stochastic manner and explore the search space of transferable\nperturbations more exhaustively. More specifically, we use a generator to\nproduce adversarial perturbations that each disturbs features in different ways\ndepending on an input latent code. Extensive experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method, outperforming the transferability\nof state-of-the-art methods.

A major obstacle to\nstudying political polarization in non-political contexts is that political\nleaning (i.e., left vs right orientation) is often unknown.

    "abstract": "We consider text retrieval within dense representational space in real-world\nsettings such as e-commerce search where (a) document popularity and (b)\ndiversity of queries associated with a document have a skewed distribution.\nMost of the contemporary dense retrieval literature presents two shortcomings\nin these settings. (1) They learn an almost equal number of representations per\ndocument, agnostic to the fact that a few head documents are disproportionately\nmore critical to achieving a good retrieval performance. (ii) They learn purely\nsemantic document representations inferred from intrinsic document\ncharacteristics which may not contain adequate information to determine the\nqueries for which the document is relevant--especially when the document is\nshort. We propose to overcome these limitations by augmenting semantic document\nrepresentations learned by bi-encoders with behavioral document representations\nlearned by our proposed approach MVG. To do so, MVG (1) determines how to\ndivide the total budget for behavioral representations by drawing a connection\nto the Pitman-Yor process, and (2) simply clusters the queries related to a\ngiven document (based on user behavior) within the representational space\nlearned by a base bi-encoder, and treats the cluster centers as its behavioral\nrepresentations. Our central contribution is the finding such a simple\nintuitive light-weight approach leads to substantial gains in key first-stage\nretrieval metrics by incurring only a marginal memory overhead. We establish\nthis via extensive experiments over three large public datasets comparing\nseveral single-vector and multi-vector bi-encoders, a proprietary e-commerce\nsearch dataset compared to production-quality bi-encoder, and an A/B test.",

    "abstract": "The success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in 3D medical image\nsegmentation relies on massive fully annotated 3D volumes for training that are\ntime-consuming and labor-intensive to acquire. In this paper, we propose to\nannotate a segmentation target with only seven points in 3D medical images, and\ndesign a two-stage weakly supervised learning framework PA-Seg. In the first\nstage, we employ geodesic distance transform to expand the seed points to\nprovide more supervision signal. To further deal with unannotated image regions\nduring training, we propose two contextual regularization strategies, i.e.,\nmulti-view Conditional Random Field (mCRF) loss and Variance Minimization (VM)\nloss, where the first one encourages pixels with similar features to have\nconsistent labels, and the second one minimizes the intensity variance for the\nsegmented foreground and background, respectively. In the second stage, we use\npredictions obtained by the model pre-trained in the first stage as pseudo\nlabels. To overcome noises in the pseudo labels, we introduce a Self and Cross\nMonitoring (SCM) strategy, which combines self-training with Cross Knowledge\nDistillation (CKD) between a primary model and an auxiliary model that learn\nfrom soft labels generated by each other. Experiments on public datasets for\nVestibular Schwannoma (VS) segmentation and Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS)\ndemonstrated that our model trained in the first stage outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art weakly supervised approaches by a large margin, and after\nusing SCM for additional training, the model can achieve competitive\nperformance compared with the fully supervised counterpart on the BraTS\ndataset.",

    "abstract": "Edge-enabled Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) introduces real-time services\nand storage, computation, and communication facilities to the vehicles through\nRoadside Units (RSUs). Nevertheless, RSUs are often easy targets for security\nassaults due to their placement in an open, unprotected environment and\nresource-constrained nature. The malicious RSUs compromised by security attacks\nimpose threats to human safety by impeding the operations of VANETs. Hence, an\neffective malevolent RSU detection mechanism is crucial for VANETs. Existing\ntrust-based detection mechanisms assign trust scores to RSUs based on their\ninteractions with moving vehicles where precise detection of rogue RSUs depends\non the accuracy of trust scores. However, brief interaction of RSUs with the\nrunning vehicles permits inadequate time to estimate trust accurately. Besides,\ncurrent works use only vehicle speed and density in beacon messages to assess\ntrust without considering the sensor-detected data in the same messages.\nNonetheless, sensor data is useful for traffic management, and neglecting them\ncreates inaccuracy in trust estimation. In this paper, we address these\nlimitations and propose a trust-based scheme to detect malicious RSUs that uses\nstable and frequent RSU-to-RSU (R2R) interaction to precisely analyze the\nbehavior of an RSU. We also offer a mechanism to detect alteration of\nsensor-detected data in beacon content and incorporate this scheme in the trust\ncalculation of RSUs.

Under the practical non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) model,\nthe closed-form expression of the maximum achievable SNR is derived in terms of\nkey geometric parameters, including the total planar array size, module\nseparation distances along each dimension, as well as the user's location in\nthe three-dimensional (3D) space. Besides, the asymptotic SNR scaling laws are\nrevealed as the number of modules along different dimensions goes to infinity.\nMoreover, we show that our developed near-field modelling and performance\nanalysis include the existing ones for the collocated XL-array, the far-field\nuniform plane wave (UPW) model, as well as the one-dimensional (1D) modular\nextremely large-scale uniform linear array (XL-ULA) as special cases. Extensive\nsimulation results are provided to validate our obtained results.",

    "title": "ROC: A New Paradigm for Lyric-to-Melody Generation",
    "abstract": "Lyric-to-melody generation is an important task in songwriting, and is also\nquite challenging due to its distinctive characteristics: the generated\nmelodies should not only follow good musical patterns, but also align with\nfeatures in lyrics such as rhythms and structures. These characteristics cannot\nbe well handled by neural generation models that learn lyric-to-melody mapping\nin an end-to-end way, due to several issues: (1) lack of aligned lyric-melody\ntraining data to sufficiently learn lyric-melody feature alignment; (2) lack of\ncontrollability in generation to explicitly guarantee the lyric-melody feature\nalignment. In this paper, we propose ROC, a new paradigm for lyric-to-melody\ngeneration that addresses the above issues through a generation-retrieval\npipeline. Specifically, our paradigm has two stages: (1) creation stage, where\na huge amount of music pieces are generated by a neural-based melody language\nmodel and indexed in a database through several key features (e.g., chords,\ntonality, rhythm, and structural information including chorus or verse); (2)\nre-creation stage, where melodies are recreated by retrieving music pieces from\nthe database according to the key features from lyrics and concatenating best\nmusic pieces based on composition guidelines and melody language model scores.\nOur ROC paradigm has several advantages: (1) It only needs unpaired melody data\nto train melody language model, instead of paired lyric-melody data in previous\nmodels. (2) It achieves good lyric-melody feature alignment in lyric-to-melody\ngeneration. Experiments on English and Chinese datasets demonstrate that ROC\noutperforms previous neural based lyric-to-melody generation models on both\nobjective and subjective metrics.",

    "abstract": "In learning-based semantic communications, neural networks have replaced\ndifferent building blocks in traditional communication systems. However, the\ndigital modulation still remains a challenge for neural networks. The intrinsic\nmechanism of neural network based digital modulation is mapping continuous\noutput of the neural network encoder into discrete constellation symbols, which\nis a non-differentiable function that cannot be trained with existing gradient\ndescend algorithms. To overcome this challenge, in this paper we develop a\njoint coding-modulation scheme for digital semantic communications with BPSK\nmodulation. In our method, the neural network outputs the likelihood of each\nconstellation point, instead of having a concrete mapping. A random code rather\nthan a deterministic code is hence used, which preserves more information for\nthe symbols with a close likelihood on each constellation point. The joint\ncoding-modulation design can match the modulation process with channel states,\nand hence improve the performance of digital semantic communications.\nExperiment results show that our method outperforms existing digital modulation\nmethods in semantic communications over a wide range of SNR, and outperforms\nneural network based analog modulation method in low SNR regime.",

    "abstract": "The cold-start problem is a long-standing challenge in recommender systems\ndue to the lack of user-item interactions, which significantly hurts the\nrecommendation effect over new users and items. Recently, meta-learning based\nmethods attempt to learn globally shared prior knowledge across all users,\nwhich can be rapidly adapted to new users and items with very few interactions.\nThough with significant performance improvement, the globally shared parameter\nmay lead to local optimum. Besides, they are oblivious to the inherent\ninformation and feature interactions existing in the new users and items, which\nare critical in cold-start scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Task aligned\nMeta-learning based Augmented Graph (TMAG) to address cold-start\nrecommendation. Specifically, a fine-grained task aligned constructor is\nproposed to cluster similar users and divide tasks for meta-learning, enabling\nconsistent optimization direction.

Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a core component\nof the RS. One of the biggest characteristics in CTR prediction at Taobao is\nthat there exist multiple recommendation domains where the scales of different\ndomains vary significantly. Therefore, it is crucial to perform cross-domain\nCTR prediction to transfer knowledge from large domains to small domains to\nalleviate the data sparsity issue. However, existing cross-domain CTR\nprediction methods are proposed for static knowledge transfer, ignoring that\nall domains in real-world RSs are continually time-evolving. In light of this,\nwe present a necessary but novel task named Continual Transfer Learning (CTL),\nwhich transfers knowledge from a time-evolving source domain to a time-evolving\ntarget domain. In this work, we propose a simple and effective CTL model called\nCTNet to solve the problem of continual cross-domain CTR prediction at Taobao,\nand CTNet can be trained efficiently. Particularly, CTNet considers an\nimportant characteristic in the industry that models has been continually\nwell-trained for a very long time. So CTNet aims to fully utilize all the\nwell-trained model parameters in both source domain and target domain to avoid\nlosing historically acquired knowledge, and only needs incremental target\ndomain data for training to guarantee efficiency. Extensive offline experiments\nand online A/B testing at Taobao demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness\nof CTNet.

By\nchanging the self-attention mechanism from attending over past events to\nattending over event types, we obtain a reduction in time and space complexity\nfrom $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ (total number of events) to\n$\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{Y}|^2)$ (number of event types). Experiments show that\nthe proposed approach improves performance in log-likelihood, prediction and\ngoodness-of-fit tasks with lower time and space complexity compared to\nstate-of-the art Transformer based architectures.",

    "abstract": "Bound propagation methods, when combined with branch and bound, are among the\nmost effective methods to formally verify properties of deep neural networks\nsuch as correctness, robustness, and safety. However, existing works cannot\nhandle the general form of cutting plane constraints widely accepted in\ntraditional solvers, which are crucial for strengthening verifiers with\ntightened convex relaxations. In this paper, we generalize the bound\npropagation procedure to allow the addition of arbitrary cutting plane\nconstraints, including those involving relaxed integer variables that do not\nappear in existing bound propagation formulations. Our generalized bound\npropagation method, GCP-CROWN, opens up the opportunity to apply general\ncutting plane methods} for neural network verification while benefiting from\nthe efficiency and GPU acceleration of bound propagation methods. As a case\nstudy, we investigate the use of cutting planes generated by off-the-shelf\nmixed integer programming (MIP) solver. We find that MIP solvers can generate\nhigh-quality cutting planes for strengthening bound-propagation-based verifiers\nusing our new formulation. Since the branching-focused bound propagation\nprocedure and the cutting-plane-focused MIP solver can run in parallel\nutilizing different types of hardware (GPUs and CPUs), their combination can\nquickly explore a large number of branches with strong cutting planes, leading\nto strong verification performance. Experiments demonstrate that our method is\nthe first verifier that can completely solve the oval20 benchmark and verify\ntwice as many instances on the oval21 benchmark compared to the best tool in\nVNN-COMP 2021, and also noticeably outperforms state-of-the-art verifiers on a\nwide range of benchmarks.

We demonstrate that such momentum can also be plugged into\nmomentum-free SSL frameworks, such as SimCLR, for a performance boost. Despite\nits wide use as a fundamental component in modern SSL frameworks, the benefit\ncaused by momentum is not well understood. We find that its success can be at\nleast partly attributed to the stability effect. In the first attempt, we\nanalyze how EMA affects each part of the encoder and reveal that the portion\nnear the encoder's input plays an insignificant role while the latter parts\nhave much more influence. By monitoring the gradient of the overall loss with\nrespect to the output of each block in the encoder, we observe that the final\nlayers tend to fluctuate much more than other layers during backpropagation,\ni.e. less stability. Interestingly, we show that using EMA to the final part of\nthe SSL encoder, i.e. projector, instead of the whole deep network encoder can\ngive comparable or preferable performance. Our proposed projector-only momentum\nhelps maintain the benefit of EMA but avoids the double forward computation.",

    "abstract": "The core of many cryptocurrencies is the decentralised validation network\noperating on proof-of-work technology. In these systems, validation is done by\nso-called miners who can digitally sign blocks once they solve a\ncomputationally-hard problem. Conventional wisdom generally considers this\nprotocol as secure and stable as miners are incentivised to follow the\nbehaviour of the majority. However, whether some strategic mining behaviours\noccur in practice is still a major concern. In this paper we target this\nquestion by focusing on a security threat: a selfish mining attack in which\nmalicious miners deviate from protocol by not immediately revealing their newly\nmined blocks. We propose a statistical test to analyse each miner's behaviour\nin five popular cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monacoin, Ethereum and\nBitcoin Cash. Our method is based on the realisation that selfish mining\nbehaviour will cause identifiable anomalies in the statistics of miner's\nsuccessive blocks discovery. Secondly, we apply heuristics-based address\nclustering to improve the detectability of this kind of behaviour. We find a\nmarked presence of abnormal miners in Monacoin and Bitcoin Cash, and, to a\nlesser extent, in Ethereum. Finally, we extend our method to detect coordinated\nselfish mining attacks, finding mining cartels in Monacoin where miners might\nsecretly share information about newly mined blocks in advance. Our analysis\ncontributes to the research on security in cryptocurrency systems by providing\nthe first empirical evidence that the aforementioned strategic mining\nbehaviours do take place in practice.",

Unlike existing dynamic NeRFs that\nrequire dense images as input and can only be modeled for a single identity,\nour method enables face reconstruction across different persons with few-shot\ninputs. Compared to state-of-the-art few-shot NeRFs designed for modeling\nstatic scenes, the proposed FDNeRF accepts view-inconsistent dynamic inputs and\nsupports arbitrary facial expression editing, i.e., producing faces with novel\nexpressions beyond the input ones. To handle the inconsistencies between\ndynamic inputs, we introduce a well-designed conditional feature warping (CFW)\nmodule to perform expression conditioned warping in 2D feature space, which is\nalso identity adaptive and 3D constrained. As a result, features of different\nexpressions are transformed into the target ones. We then construct a radiance\nfield based on these view-consistent features and use volumetric rendering to\nsynthesize novel views of the modeled faces. Extensive experiments with\nquantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting dynamic and few-shot NeRFs on both 3D face reconstruction and\nexpression editing tasks.

    "abstract": "Recent advance in Dense Retrieval (DR) techniques has significantly improved\nthe effectiveness of first-stage retrieval. Trained with large-scale supervised\ndata, DR models can encode queries and documents into a low-dimensional dense\nspace and conduct effective semantic matching. However, previous studies have\nshown that the effectiveness of DR models would drop by a large margin when the\ntrained DR models are adopted in a target domain that is different from the\ndomain of the labeled data. One of the possible reasons is that the DR model\nhas never seen the target corpus and thus might be incapable of mitigating the\ndifference between the training and target domains. In practice, unfortunately,\ntraining a DR model for each target domain to avoid domain shift is often a\ndifficult task as it requires additional time, storage, and domain-specific\ndata labeling, which are not always available. To address this problem, in this\npaper, we propose a novel DR framework named Disentangled Dense Retrieval (DDR)\nto support effective and flexible domain adaptation for DR models. DDR consists\nof a Relevance Estimation Module (REM) for modeling domain-invariant matching\npatterns and several Domain Adaption Modules (DAMs) for modeling\ndomain-specific features of multiple target corpora. By making the REM and DAMs\ndisentangled, DDR enables a flexible training paradigm in which REM is trained\nwith supervision once and DAMs are trained with unsupervised data.\nComprehensive experiments in different domains and languages show that DDR\nsignificantly improves ranking performance compared to strong DR baselines and\nsubstantially outperforms traditional retrieval methods in most scenarios.",

From this, there has been considerable research aimed at\nexamining the potential uses of these natural language generators (NLG) towards\na wide number of tasks. The increasing capabilities of powerful text generators\nto mimic human writing convincingly raises the potential for deception and\nother forms of dangerous misuse.

While the\ncliques is too stiff to applicate to real cases, the k-plex relaxes the notion\nof the clique, allowing each node to miss up to k connections. Although\nk-plexes are more flexible than cliques, finding them is more challenging as\ntheir number is greater. In this paper, we aim to detect the k-plex under the\nsize and time constraints, leveraging the new vision of automated learning\nbounding strategy. We introduce the constraint learning concept to learn the\nbound strategy from the branch and bound process and develop it into a Mixed\nInteger Programming framework. While most of the work is dedicated on learn the\nbranch strategy in branch and bound-based algorithms, we focus on the learn to\nbound strategy which needs to handle the problem that learned strategy might\nnot examine the feasible solution. We adopted the MILP framework and design a\nset of variables relative to the k-plex property as our constraint space to\nlearn the strategy. The learn to bound strategy learning the original strategy\nfunction also reduces the computation load of the bound process to accelerate\nthe branch and bound algorithm.

Due to\nuncertainties and variabilities of the environment, it is critical to learn a\nrobust policy -- with as few samples as possible -- that performs well even\nwhen the deployed environment deviates from the nominal one used to collect the\nhistory dataset. We consider a distributionally robust formulation of offline\nRL, focusing on a tabular non-stationary finite-horizon robust Markov decision\nprocess with an uncertainty set specified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence.\nTo combat with sample scarcity, a model-based algorithm that combines\ndistributionally robust value iteration with the principle of pessimism in the\nface of uncertainty is proposed, by penalizing the robust value estimates with\na carefully designed data-driven penalty term. Under a mild and tailored\nassumption of the history dataset that measures distribution shift without\nrequiring full coverage of the state-action space, we establish the\nfinite-sample complexity of the proposed algorithm, and further show it is\nalmost unimprovable in light of a nearly-matching information-theoretic lower\nbound up to a polynomial factor of the horizon length.

    "abstract": "Pose-based action recognition is predominantly tackled by approaches which\ntreat the input skeleton in a monolithic fashion, i.e. joints in the pose tree\nare processed as a whole. However, such approaches ignore the fact that action\ncategories are often characterized by localized action dynamics involving only\nsmall subsets of part joint groups involving hands (e.g. `Thumbs up') or legs\n(e.g. `Kicking'). Although part-grouping based approaches exist, each part\ngroup is not considered within the global pose frame, causing such methods to\nfall short. Further, conventional approaches employ independent modality\nstreams (e.g. joint, bone, joint velocity, bone velocity) and train their\nnetwork multiple times on these streams, which massively increases the number\nof training parameters. To address these issues, we introduce PSUMNet, a novel\napproach for scalable and efficient pose-based action recognition. At the\nrepresentation level, we propose a global frame based part stream approach as\nopposed to conventional modality based streams. Within each part stream, the\nassociated data from multiple modalities is unified and consumed by the\nprocessing pipeline. Experimentally, PSUMNet achieves state of the art\nperformance on the widely used NTURGB+D 60/120 dataset and dense joint skeleton\ndataset NTU 60-X/120-X. PSUMNet is highly efficient and outperforms competing\nmethods which use 100%-400% more parameters. PSUMNet also generalizes to the\nSHREC hand gesture dataset with competitive performance. Overall, PSUMNet's\nscalability, performance and efficiency makes it an attractive choice for\naction recognition and for deployment on compute-restricted embedded and edge\ndevices.

Furthermore, siamese\ngraph neural network is utilized by PSG for representation learning of two\ncontrastive links, which are a positive link and a negative link. We evaluate\nthe proposed algorithm PSG on a link property prediction dataset of Open Graph\nBenchmark (OGB), ogbl-ddi. PSG achieves top 1 performance on ogbl-ddi.

    "abstract": "The supervised-learning-based morphing attack detection (MAD) solutions\nachieve outstanding success in dealing with attacks from known morphing\ntechniques and known data sources. However, given variations in the morphing\nattacks, the performance of supervised MAD solutions drops significantly due to\nthe insufficient diversity and quantity of the existing MAD datasets. To\naddress this concern, we propose a completely unsupervised MAD solution via\nself-paced anomaly detection (SPL-MAD) by leveraging the existing large-scale\nface recognition (FR) datasets and the unsupervised nature of convolutional\nautoencoders. Using general FR datasets that might contain unintentionally and\nunlabeled manipulated samples to train an autoencoder can lead to a diverse\nreconstruction behavior of attack and bona fide samples. We analyze this\nbehavior empirically to provide a solid theoretical ground for designing our\nunsupervised MAD solution. This also results in proposing to integrate our\nadapted modified self-paced learning paradigm to enhance the reconstruction\nerror separability between the bona fide and attack samples in a completely\nunsupervised manner. Our experimental results on a diverse set of MAD\nevaluation datasets show that the proposed unsupervised SPL-MAD solution\noutperforms the overall performance of a wide range of supervised MAD solutions\nand provides higher generalizability on unknown attacks.",

    "abstract": "Despite years of research, out-of-domain generalization remains a critical\nweakness of deep networks for semantic segmentation. Previous studies relied on\nthe assumption of a static model, i.e. once the training process is complete,\nmodel parameters remain fixed at test time. In this work, we challenge this\npremise with a self-adaptive approach for semantic segmentation that adjusts\nthe inference process to each input sample. Self-adaptation operates on two\nlevels. First, it employs a self-supervised loss that customizes the parameters\nof convolutional layers in the network to the input image. Second, in Batch\nNormalization layers, self-adaptation approximates the mean and the variance of\nthe entire test data, which is assumed unavailable. It achieves this by\ninterpolating between the training and the reference distribution derived from\na single test sample. To empirically analyze our self-adaptive inference\nstrategy, we develop and follow a rigorous evaluation protocol that addresses\nserious limitations of previous work. Our extensive analysis leads to a\nsurprising conclusion: Using a standard training procedure, self-adaptation\nsignificantly outperforms strong baselines and sets new state-of-the-art\naccuracy on multi-domain benchmarks. Our study suggests that self-adaptive\ninference may complement the established practice of model regularization at\ntraining time for improving deep network generalization to out-of-domain data.",

    "abstract": "It is inevitably crucial to classify sleep stage for the diagnosis of various\ndiseases. However, existing automated diagnosis methods mostly adopt the\n\"gold-standard\" lectroencephalogram (EEG) or other uni-modal sensing signal of\nthe PolySomnoGraphy (PSG) machine in hospital, that are expensive, importable\nand therefore unsuitable for point-of-care monitoring at home. To enable the\nsleep stage monitoring at home, in this paper, we analyze the relationship\nbetween infrared videos and the EEG signal and propose a new task: to classify\nthe sleep stage using infrared videos by distilling useful knowledge from EEG\nsignals to the visual ones. To establish a solid cross-modal benchmark for this\napplication, we develop a new dataset termed as Seeing your Sleep Stage via\nInfrared Video and EEG ($S^3VE$). $S^3VE$ is a large-scale dataset including\nsynchronized infrared video and EEG signal for sleep stage classification,\nincluding 105 subjects and 154,573 video clips that is more than 1100 hours\nlong. Our contributions are not limited to datasets but also about a novel\ncross-modal distillation baseline model namely the structure-aware contrastive\ndistillation (SACD) to distill the EEG knowledge to infrared video features.\nThe SACD achieved the state-of-the-art performances on both our $S^3VE$ and the\nexisting cross-modal distillation benchmark.

    "abstract": "Video Object Grounding (VOG) is the problem of associating spatial object\nregions in the video to a descriptive natural language query. This is a\nchallenging vision-language task that necessitates constructing the correct\ncross-modal correspondence and modeling the appropriate spatio-temporal context\nof the query video and caption, thereby localizing the specific objects\naccurately. In this paper, we tackle this task by a novel framework called\nHiErarchical spatio-tempoRal reasOning (HERO) with contrastive action\ncorrespondence. We study the VOG task at two aspects that prior works\noverlooked: (1) Contrastive Action Correspondence-aware Retrieval. Notice that\nthe fine-grained video semantics (e.g., multiple actions) is not totally\naligned with the annotated language query (e.g., single action), we first\nintroduce the weakly-supervised contrastive learning that classifies the video\nas action-consistent and action-independent frames relying on the video-caption\naction semantic correspondence. Such a design can build the fine-grained\ncross-modal correspondence for more accurate subsequent VOG. (2) Hierarchical\nSpatio-temporal Modeling Improvement. While transformer-based VOG models\npresent their potential in sequential modality (i.e., video and caption)\nmodeling, existing evidence also indicates that the transformer suffers from\nthe issue of the insensitive spatio-temporal locality. Motivated by that, we\ncarefully design the hierarchical reasoning layers to decouple fully connected\nmulti-head attention and remove the redundant interfering correlations.\nFurthermore, our proposed pyramid and shifted alignment mechanisms are\neffective to improve the cross-modal information utilization of neighborhood\nspatial regions and temporal frames.

    "abstract": "Recently, untrained neural networks (UNNs) have shown satisfactory\nperformances for MR image reconstruction on random sampling trajectories\nwithout using additional full-sampled training data. However, the existing\nUNN-based approach does not fully use the MR image physical priors, resulting\nin poor performance in some common scenarios (e.g., partial Fourier, regular\nsampling, etc.) and the lack of theoretical guarantees for reconstruction\naccuracy. To bridge this gap, we propose a safeguarded k-space interpolation\nmethod for MRI using a specially designed UNN with a tripled architecture\ndriven by three physical priors of the MR images (or k-space data), including\nsparsity, coil sensitivity smoothness, and phase smoothness. We also prove that\nthe proposed method guarantees tight bounds for interpolated k-space data\naccuracy. Finally, ablation experiments show that the proposed method can more\naccurately characterize the physical priors of MR images than existing\ntraditional methods. Additionally, under a series of commonly used sampling\ntrajectories, experiments also show that the proposed method consistently\noutperforms traditional parallel imaging methods and existing UNNs, and even\noutperforms the state-of-the-art supervised-trained k-space deep learning\nmethods in some cases.",

The results\nindicate that investigated databases lack diversity and, more importantly, show\nthat the utilised DeepFake detection models are strongly biased towards many\ninvestigated attributes.

Although it has achieved great success,\nmost of existing methods require the label information for all training samples\nin source domains, which is time-consuming and expensive in the real-world\napplication. In this paper, we resort to solving the semi-supervised domain\ngeneralization (SSDG) task, where there are a few label information in each\nsource domain. To address the task, we first analyze the theory of the\nmulti-domain learning, which highlights that 1) mitigating the impact of domain\ngap and 2) exploiting all samples to train the model can effectively reduce the\ngeneralization error in each source domain so as to improve the quality of\npseudo-labels. According to the analysis, we propose MultiMatch, i.e.,\nextending FixMatch to the multi-task learning framework, producing the\nhigh-quality pseudo-label for SSDG. To be specific, we consider each training\ndomain as a single task (i.e., local task) and combine all training domains\ntogether (i.e., global task) to train an extra task for the unseen test domain.\nIn the multi-task framework, we utilize the independent BN and classifier for\neach task, which can effectively alleviate the interference from different\ndomains during pseudo-labeling. Also, most of parameters in the framework are\nshared, which can be trained by all training samples sufficiently. Moreover, to\nfurther boost the pseudo-label accuracy and the model's generalization, we fuse\nthe predictions from the global task and local task during training and\ntesting, respectively. A series of experiments validate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed method, and it outperforms the existing semi-supervised methods\nand the SSDG method on several benchmark DG datasets.",

This operation, therefore, poses serious security issues\nrelated to the ability of a travel or identity document to be verified to\nbelong to multiple persons. Previous works touched on the issue of the quality\nof morphing attack images, however, with the main goal of quantitatively\nproofing the realistic appearance of the produced morphing attacks. We theorize\nthat the morphing processes might have an effect on both, the perceptual image\nquality and the image utility in face recognition (FR) when compared to bona\nfide samples. Towards investigating this theory, this work provides an\nextensive analysis of the effect of morphing on face image quality, including\nboth general image quality measures and face image utility measures. This\nanalysis is not limited to a single morphing technique, but rather looks at six\ndifferent morphing techniques and five different data sources using ten\ndifferent quality measures. This analysis reveals consistent separability\nbetween the quality scores of morphing attack and bona fide samples measured by\ncertain quality measures. Our study goes further to build on this effect and\ninvestigate the possibility of performing unsupervised morphing attack\ndetection (MAD) based on quality scores. Our study looks intointra and\ninter-dataset detectability to evaluate the generalizability of such a\ndetection concept on different morphing techniques and bona fide sources.

To cope with the\nunsuited storage (e.g., ledger) and computing power (e.g., proof of work\npuzzle) requirements of the Blockchain in the commercial off-the-shelf IoT\ndevices, we propose a partial consistent cut protocol and engineer a modular\narithmetic-based lightweight proof of work puzzle, respectively.

Disturbances such as wind might lead to deviations\nfrom the planned trajectories.\nIn this work, we present a fast predictive obstacle avoidance method that\ndoes not depend on higher-level localization or mapping and maintains the\ndynamic flight capabilities of UAVs. It directly operates on LiDAR range images\nin real time and adjusts the current flight direction by computing angular\npotential fields within the range image. The velocity magnitude is subsequently\ndetermined based on a trajectory prediction and time-to-contact estimation.\nOur method is evaluated using Hardware-in-the-Loop simulations. It keeps the\nUAV at a safe distance to obstacles, while allowing higher flight velocities\nthan previous reactive obstacle avoidance methods that directly operate on\nsensor data.",

    "abstract": "Uncertainty is an essential consideration for time series forecasting tasks.\nIn this work, we specifically focus on quantifying the uncertainty of traffic\nforecasting. To achieve this, we develop Deep Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty\nQuantification (DeepSTUQ), which can estimate both aleatoric and epistemic\nuncertainty. We first leverage a spatio-temporal model to model the complex\nspatio-temporal correlations of traffic data. Subsequently, two independent\nsub-neural networks maximizing the heterogeneous log-likelihood are developed\nto estimate aleatoric uncertainty. For estimating epistemic uncertainty, we\ncombine the merits of variational inference and deep ensembling by integrating\nthe Monte Carlo dropout and the Adaptive Weight Averaging re-training methods,\nrespectively. Finally, we propose a post-processing calibration approach based\non Temperature Scaling, which improves the model's generalization ability to\nestimate uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on four public\ndatasets, and the empirical results suggest that the proposed method\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both point prediction and\nuncertainty quantification.",

Specifically, by jointly designing the target\ndetection beamformer and communication beamformer, we aim to maximize the radar\ndetection mutual information (MI) (or the communication rate) subject to the\ncovert constraint, the communication rate constraint (or the radar detection MI\nconstraint), and the total power constraint. For the perfect eavesdropper's\nchannel state information (CSI) scenario, we transform the covert beamforming\ndesign problems into a series of convex subproblems, by exploiting semidefinite\nrelaxation, which can be solved via the bisection search method. Considering\nthe high complexity of iterative optimization, we further propose a\nsingle-iterative covert beamformer design scheme based on the zero-forcing\ncriterion. For the imperfect eavesdropper's CSI scenario, we develop a\nrelaxation and restriction method to tackle the robust covert beamforming\ndesign problems.

However, most of the existing detectors\nuniformly quantize all variables, resulting in high redundancy and low\nflexibility. Requiring both expertise and efforts, an in-depth tailored\nquantization usually asks for prohibitive costs and is not considered by\nconventional MIMO detectors. In this paper, a general framework named the\nautomatic hybrid-precision quantization (AHPQ) is proposed with two parts:\nintegral quantization determined by probability density function (PDF), and\nfractional quantization by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Being automatic,\nAHPQ demonstrates high efficiency in figuring out good quantizations for a set\nof algorithmic parameters. For the approximate message passing (AMP) detector,\nAHPQ achieves up to $58.7\\%$ lower average bitwidth than the unified\nquantization (UQ) one with almost no performance sacrifice. The feasibility of\nAHPQ has been verified by implementation with $65$ nm CMOS technology. Compared\nwith its UQ counterpart, AHPQ exhibits $2.97\\times$ higher throughput-to-area\nratio (TAR) with $19.3\\%$ lower energy dissipation. Moreover, by node\ncompression and strength reduction, the AHPQ detector outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art (SOA) in both throughput ($17.92$ Gb/s) and energy efficiency\n($7.93$ pJ/b).

Specifically, in FL,\nmodels are trained on the users devices and only model updates (i.e.,\ngradients) are sent to a central server for aggregation purposes. However, the\nlong list of inference attacks that leak private data from gradients, published\nin the recent years, have emphasized the need of devising effective protection\nmechanisms to incentivize the adoption of FL at scale. While there exist\nsolutions to mitigate these attacks on the server side, little has been done to\nprotect users from attacks performed on the client side.

    "abstract": "Security against eavesdropping is one of the key concerns in the design of\nany communication system. Many common considerations of the security of a\nwireless communication channel rely on comparing the signal level measured by\nBob (the intended receiver) to that accessible to Eve (an eavesdropper).\nFrameworks such as Wyner's wiretap model ensure the security of a link, in an\naverage sense, when Bob's signal-to-noise ratio exceeds Eve's. Unfortunately,\nbecause these guarantees rely on statistical assumptions about noise, Eve can\nstill occasionally succeed in decoding information. The goal of achieving\nexactly zero probability of intercept over an engineered region of the\nbroadcast sector, which we term absolute security, remains elusive. Here, we\ndescribe the first architecture for a wireless link which provides absolute\nsecurity. Our approach relies on the inherent properties of broadband and\nhigh-gain antennas, and is therefore ideally suited for implementation in\nmillimeter-wave and terahertz wireless systems, where such antennas will\ngenerally be employed. We exploit spatial minima of the antenna pattern at\ndifferent frequencies, the union of which defines a wide region where Eve is\nguaranteed to fail regardless of her computational capabilities, and regardless\nof the noise in the channels. Unlike conventional zero-forcing beam forming\nmethods, we show that, for realistic assumptions about the antenna\nconfiguration and power budget, this absolute security guarantee can be\nachieved over most possible eavesdropper locations.

The former\nreconstructs a LiDAR scan with state estimations, and excludes the possible\nfaulty estimations that are not aligned with LiDAR measurements. We also verify\nthe correctness of LiDAR scans by comparing them with the reconstructed ones\nand removing the possibly compromised sector in the scan. Fault tolerant\ncontrol computes a control signal with the remaining estimations at each time\nstep. We prove that the synthesized control input guarantees system safety\nusing control barrier certificates. We validate our proposed framework using a\nUAV delivery system in an urban environment.

    "abstract": "Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI Codex have shown\nimmense potential in automating significant aspects of coding by producing\nnatural code from informal natural language (NL) intent. However, the code\nproduced does not have any correctness guarantees around satisfying user's\nintent. In fact, it is hard to define a notion of correctness since natural\nlanguage can be ambiguous and lacks a formal semantics. In this paper, we take\na first step towards addressing the problem above by proposing the workflow of\ntest-driven user-intent formalization (TDUIF), which leverages lightweight user\nfeedback to jointly (a) formalize the user intent as tests (a partial\nspecification), and (b) generates code that meets the formal user intent. To\nperform a scalable and large-scale automated evaluation of the algorithms\nwithout requiring a user in the loop, we describe how to simulate user\ninteraction with high-fidelity using a reference solution. We also describe and\nimplement alternate implementations of several algorithmic components\n(including mutating and ranking a set of tests) that can be composed for\nefficient solutions to the TDUIF problem. We have developed a system TICODER\nthat implements several solutions to TDUIF, and compare their relative\neffectiveness on the MBPP academic code generation benchmark. Our results are\npromising with using the OpenAI Codex LLM on MBPP: our best algorithm improves\nthe pass@1 code generation accuracy metric from 48.39% to 70.49% with a single\nuser query, and up to 85.48% with up to 5 user queries. Second, we can generate\na non-trivial functional unit test consistent with the user intent within an\naverage of 1.69 user queries for 90.40% of the examples for this dataset.",

Despite rapid\nprogress, state-of-the-art encoders are restrictive to canonicalized point\nclouds, and have weaker than necessary performance when encountering geometric\ntransformation distortions. To overcome this challenge, we propose PointTree, a\ngeneral-purpose point cloud encoder that is robust to transformations based on\nrelaxed K-D trees. Key to our approach is the design of the division rule in\nK-D trees by using principal component analysis (PCA). We use the structure of\nthe relaxed K-D tree as our computational graph, and model the features as\nborder descriptors which are merged with pointwise-maximum operation. In\naddition to this novel architecture design, we further improve the robustness\nby introducing pre-alignment -- a simple yet effective PCA-based normalization\nscheme. Our PointTree encoder combined with pre-alignment consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins, for applications from\nobject classification to semantic segmentation on various transformed versions\nof the widely-benchmarked datasets.

In contrast to existing\ncorrespondence-driven methods that do not perform well given sparse views, we\npropose a top-down prediction based approach for estimating camera viewpoints.\nOur key technical insight is the use of an energy-based formulation for\nrepresenting distributions over relative camera rotations, thus allowing us to\nexplicitly represent multiple camera modes arising from object symmetries or\nviews. Leveraging these relative predictions, we jointly estimate a consistent\nset of camera rotations from multiple images.

Further, our probabilistic approach significantly\noutperforms directly regressing relative poses, suggesting that modeling\nmultimodality is important for coherent joint reconstruction.

The goal of\nsingle-step retrosynthesis is to identify the possible reactants that lead to\nthe synthesis of the target product in one reaction. By representing organic\nmolecules as canonical strings, existing sequence-based retrosynthetic methods\ntreat the product-to-reactant retrosynthesis as a sequence-to-sequence\ntranslation problem. However, most of them struggle to identify diverse\nchemical reactions for a desired product due to the deterministic inference,\nwhich contradicts the fact that many compounds can be synthesized through\nvarious reaction types with different sets of reactants. In this work, we aim\nto increase reaction diversity and generate various reactants using discrete\nlatent variables. We propose a novel sequence-based approach, namely\nRetroDVCAE, which incorporates conditional variational autoencoders into\nsingle-step retrosynthesis and associates discrete latent variables with the\ngeneration process. Specifically, RetroDVCAE uses the Gumbel-Softmax\ndistribution to approximate the categorical distribution over potential\nreactions and generates multiple sets of reactants with the variational\ndecoder. Experiments demonstrate that RetroDVCAE outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines on both benchmark dataset and homemade dataset.

Decoding SCs is the most computational expensive task in\nthe control device of quantum computers (QCs), and many works focus on accurate\ndecoding algorithms for SCs, including ones with neural networks (NNs).\nPractical QCs also require low-latency decoding because slow decoding leads to\nthe accumulation of errors on qubits, resulting in logical failures. For QCs\nwith superconducting qubits, a practical decoder must be very power-efficient\nin addition to high accuracy and low latency. In order to reduce the hardware\ncomplexity of QC, we are supposed to decode SCs in a cryogenic environment with\na limited power budget, where superconducting qubits operate.\nIn this paper, we propose an NN-based accurate, fast, and low-power decoder\ncapable of decoding SCs and lattice surgery (LS) operations with measurement\nerrors on ancillary qubits. To achieve both accuracy and hardware efficiency of\nSC decoder, we apply a binarized neural network.

In this context, blobs\nmay correspond to stars born in-situ versus those accreted from satellites, and\nthe task of blob detection is to disentangle these components. A difficulty\narises when the distributions come with significant uncertainties, as is the\ncase for stellar population recoveries inferred from modelling spectra of\nunresolved stellar systems. There is currently no satisfactory method for blob\ndetection with uncertainties. Aims.

As a prerequisite\nto apply ULoG to stellar population modelling, we introduce a method for\nefficient computation of uncertainties for spectral modelling. This method is\nbased on the truncated Singular Value Decomposition and Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo sampling (SVD-MCMC). Results. We apply the methods to data of the star\ncluster M54. We show that the SVD-MCMC inferences match those from standard\nMCMC, but are a factor 5-10 faster to compute.

Standard approaches pose lesion detection as a segmentation\nproblem despite the time-consuming nature of acquiring segmentation labels. In\nthis paper, we present a lesion detection method which relies only on point\nlabels. Our model, which is trained via heatmap regression, can detect a\nvariable number of lesions in a probabilistic manner. In fact, our proposed\npost-processing method offers a reliable way of directly estimating the lesion\nexistence uncertainty. Experimental results on Gad lesion detection show our\npoint-based method performs competitively compared to training on expensive\nsegmentation labels. Finally, our detection model provides a suitable\npre-training for segmentation. When fine-tuning on only 17 segmentation\nsamples, we achieve comparable performance to training with the full dataset.",

    "abstract": "Causal graph discovery and causal effect estimation are two fundamental tasks\nin causal inference. While many methods have been developed for each task\nindividually, statistical challenges arise when applying these methods jointly:\nestimating causal effects after running causal discovery algorithms on the same\ndata leads to \"double dipping,\" invalidating coverage guarantees of classical\nconfidence intervals. To this end, we develop tools for valid\npost-causal-discovery inference. One key contribution is a randomized version\nof the greedy equivalence search (GES) algorithm, which permits a valid,\nfinite-sample correction of classical confidence intervals. Across empirical\nstudies, we show that a naive combination of causal discovery and subsequent\ninference algorithms typically leads to highly inflated miscoverage rates; at\nthe same time, our noisy GES method provides reliable coverage control while\nachieving more accurate causal graph recovery than data splitting.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional graph networks are used in particle physics for effective event\nreconstructions and classifications. However, their performances can be limited\nby the considerable amount of sensors used in modern particle detectors if\napplied to sensor-level data. We present a pooling scheme that uses\npartitioning to create pooling kernels on graphs, similar to pooling on images.\nPartition pooling can be used to adopt successful image recognition\narchitectures for graph neural network applications in particle physics. The\nreduced computational resources allow for deeper networks and more extensive\nhyperparameter optimizations. To show its applicability, we construct a\nconvolutional graph network with partition pooling that reconstructs simulated\ninteraction vertices for an idealized neutrino detector. The pooling network\nyields improved performance and is less susceptible to overfitting than a\nsimilar network without pooling. The lower resource requirements allow the\nconstruction of a deeper network with further improved performance.",

    "abstract": "We present a method of detecting bifurcations by locating zeros of a signed\nversion of the smallest singular value of the Jacobian. This enables the use of\nquadratically convergent root-bracketing techniques or Chebyshev interpolation\nto locate bifurcation points. Only positive singular values have to be\ncomputed, though the method relies on the existence of an analytic or smooth\nsingular value decomposition (SVD). The sign of the determinant of the\nJacobian, computed as part of the bidiagonal reduction in the SVD algorithm,\neliminates slope discontinuities at the zeros of the smallest singular value.\nWe use the method to search for spatially quasi-periodic traveling water waves\nthat bifurcate from large-amplitude periodic waves. The water wave equations\nare formulated in a conformal mapping framework to facilitate the computation\nof the quasi-periodic Dirichlet-Neumann operator. We find examples of pure\ngravity waves with zero surface tension and overhanging gravity-capillary\nwaves. In both cases, the waves have two spatial quasi-periods whose ratio is\nirrational. We follow the secondary branches via numerical continuation beyond\nthe realm of linearization about solutions on the primary branch to obtain\ntraveling water waves that extend over the real line with no two crests or\ntroughs of exactly the same shape. The pure gravity wave problem is of\nrelevance to ocean waves, where capillary effects can be neglected. Such waves\ncan only exist through secondary bifurcation as they do not persist to zero\namplitude. The gravity-capillary wave problem demonstrates the effectiveness of\nusing the signed smallest singular value as a test function for multi-parameter\nbifurcation problems. This test function becomes mesh independent once the mesh\nis fine enough.",

To this end, we introduce novel classes of\nrobust control barrier functions (RCBF) and robust control Lyapunov functions\n(RCLF) that facilitate the synthesis of safety-critical controllers in the\npresence of parametric uncertainty using quadratic programming. Since the\ninitial bounds on the system uncertainty may be highly conservative, we present\na data-driven approach to reducing such bounds using input-output data\ncollected online. In particular, we leverage an integral set-membership\nidentification algorithm that iteratively shrinks the set of possible system\nparameters online and guarantees stability and safety during learning. The\nefficacy of the developed approach is illustrated on two numerical examples.",
