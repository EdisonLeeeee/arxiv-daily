    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) aims to learn joint knowledge from a large scale of\ndecentralized devices with labeled data in a privacy-preserving manner.\nHowever, since high-quality labeled data require expensive human intelligence\nand efforts, data with incorrect labels (called noisy labels) are ubiquitous in\nreality, which inevitably cause performance degradation. Although a lot of\nmethods are proposed to directly deal with noisy labels, these methods either\nrequire excessive computation overhead or violate the privacy protection\nprinciple of FL. To this end, we focus on this issue in FL with the purpose of\nalleviating performance degradation yielded by noisy labels meanwhile\nguaranteeing data privacy. Specifically, we propose a Local Self-Regularization\nmethod, which effectively regularizes the local training process via implicitly\nhindering the model from memorizing noisy labels and explicitly narrowing the\nmodel output discrepancy between original and augmented instances using self\ndistillation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can\nachieve notable resistance against noisy labels in various noise levels on\nthree benchmark datasets. In addition, we integrate our method with existing\nstate-of-the-arts and achieve superior performance on the real-world dataset\nClothing1M.

    "title": "Adaptively-weighted Integral Space for Fast Multiview Clustering",
    "abstract": "Multiview clustering has been extensively studied to take advantage of\nmulti-source information to improve the clustering performance. In general,\nmost of the existing works typically compute an n * n affinity graph by some\nsimilarity/distance metrics (e.g. the Euclidean distance) or learned\nrepresentations, and explore the pairwise correlations across views. But\nunfortunately, a quadratic or even cubic complexity is often needed, bringing\nabout difficulty in clustering largescale datasets. Some efforts have been made\nrecently to capture data distribution in multiple views by selecting view-wise\nanchor representations with k-means, or by direct matrix factorization on the\noriginal observations. Despite the significant success, few of them have\nconsidered the view-insufficiency issue, implicitly holding the assumption that\neach individual view is sufficient to recover the cluster structure. Moreover,\nthe latent integral space as well as the shared cluster structure from multiple\ninsufficient views is not able to be simultaneously discovered. In view of\nthis, we propose an Adaptively-weighted Integral Space for Fast Multiview\nClustering (AIMC) with nearly linear complexity. Specifically, view generation\nmodels are designed to reconstruct the view observations from the latent\nintegral space with diverse adaptive contributions. Meanwhile, a centroid\nrepresentation with orthogonality constraint and cluster partition are\nseamlessly constructed to approximate the latent integral space. An alternate\nminimizing algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem, which is\nproved to have linear time complexity w.r.t. the sample size. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on several realworld datasets confirm the superiority of\nthe proposed AIMC method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

To this end, we\ndeveloped an inherently interpretable multilevel Bayesian modeling framework\ninspired by the piecewise linearity of ReLU-activated deep neural networks. In\na survival model, we explicitly adjust for confounding in quantifying local\naverage treatment effects for discharge placement interventions. We trained the\nmodel on a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2008 and 2011, and then\ntested the model on 2012 claims. Evaluated on classification accuracy for\n30-day all-cause unplanned readmissions (defined using official CMS\nmethodology) or death, the model performed similarly against XGBoost, logistic\nregression (after feature engineering), and a Bayesian deep neural network\ntrained on the same data. Tested on the 30-day classification task of\npredicting readmissions or death using left-out future data, the model achieved\nan AUROC of approximately 0.76 and and AUPRC of approximately 0.50 (relative to\nan overall positively rate in the testing data of 18%), demonstrating how one\nneed not sacrifice interpretability for accuracy. Additionally, the model had a\ntesting AUROC of 0.78 on the classification of 90-day all-cause unplanned\nreadmission or death.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have proven that graph neural networks are vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks. Attackers can rely solely on the training labels to\ndisrupt the performance of the agnostic victim model by edge perturbations.\nResearchers observe that the saliency-based attackers tend to add edges rather\nthan delete them, which is previously explained by the fact that adding edges\npollutes the nodes' features by aggregation while removing edges only leads to\nsome loss of information. In this paper, we further prove that the attackers\nperturb graphs by adding inter-class edges, which also manifests as a reduction\nin the homophily of the perturbed graph. From this point of view,\nsaliency-based attackers still have room for improvement in capability and\nimperceptibility. The message passing of the GNN-based surrogate model leads to\nthe oversmoothing of nodes connected by inter-class edges, preventing attackers\nfrom obtaining the distinctiveness of node features. To solve this issue, we\nintroduce a multi-hop aggregated message passing to preserve attribute\ndifferences between nodes. In addition, we propose a regularization term to\nrestrict the homophily variance to enhance the attack imperceptibility.\nExperiments verify that our proposed surrogate model improves the attacker's\nversatility and the regularization term helps to limit the homophily of the\nperturbed graph.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the Internet of Things\n(IoT)-enabled network edge has realized edge intelligence in several\napplications such as smart agriculture, smart hospitals, and smart factories by\nenabling low-latency and computational efficiency. However, deploying\nstate-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as VGG-16 and\nResNets on resource-constrained edge devices is practically infeasible due to\ntheir large number of parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs). Thus,\nthe concept of network pruning as a type of model compression is gaining\nattention for accelerating CNNs on low-power devices. State-of-the-art pruning\napproaches, either structured or unstructured do not consider the different\nunderlying nature of complexities being exhibited by convolutional layers and\nfollow a training-pruning-retraining pipeline, which results in additional\ncomputational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel and computationally\nefficient pruning pipeline by exploiting the inherent layer-level complexities\nof CNNs. Unlike typical methods, our proposed complexity-driven algorithm\nselects a particular layer for filter-pruning based on its contribution to\noverall network complexity. We follow a procedure that directly trains the\npruned model and avoids the computationally complex ranking and fine-tuning\nsteps. Moreover, we define three modes of pruning, namely parameter-aware (PA),\nFLOPs-aware (FA), and memory-aware (MA), to introduce versatile compression of\nCNNs. Our results show the competitive performance of our approach in terms of\naccuracy and acceleration.

They results from reformulation of\nthe original problem as an equivalent optimization problem with equality\nconstraints. The algorithms naturally follow from steps aimed at recovering the\ngradient-decent algorithm based on ODE solvers that explicitly account for\nsensitivity of the ODE solution. In our first proposed algorithm we avoid\nexplicitly solving the ODE by integrating the ODE solver as a sequence of\nimplicit constraints. In our second algorithm, we use an ODE solver to reset\nthe ODE solution, but no direct are adjoint sensitivity analysis methods are\nused. Both algorithm accepts mini-batch implementations and show significant\nefficiency benefits from GPU-based parallelization. We demonstrate the\nperformance of the algorithms when applied to learning the parameters of the\nCucker-Smale model. The algorithms are compared with gradient descent\nalgorithms based on ODE solvers endowed with sensitivity analysis capabilities,\nfor various number of state size, using Pytorch and Jax implementations. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are at least 4x\nfaster than the Pytorch implementations, and at least 16x faster than Jax\nimplementations. For large versions of the Cucker-Smale model, the Jax\nimplementation is thousands of times faster than the sensitivity analysis-based\nimplementation.

Unfortunately, computing\nthe Shapley value is computationally intractable in general. This paper focuses\non computing the Shapley value of (weighted) connectivity games. For these\nconnectivity games, that are defined on an underlying (weighted) graph,\ncomputing the Shapley value is #P-hard, and thus (likely) intractable even for\ngraphs with a moderate number of vertices. We present an algorithm that can\nefficiently compute the Shapley value if the underlying graph has bounded\ntreewidth. Next, we apply our algorithm to several real-world (covert)\nnetworks. We show that our algorithm can compute exact Shapley values for these\nnetworks quickly, whereas in prior work these values could only be approximated\nusing a heuristic method.

    "abstract": "Inferring the position of objects and their rigid transformations is still an\nopen problem in visual scene understanding. Here we propose a neuromorphic\nsolution that utilizes an efficient factorization network which is based on\nthree key concepts: (1) a computational framework based on Vector Symbolic\nArchitectures (VSA) with complex-valued vectors; (2) the design of Hierarchical\nResonator Networks (HRN) to deal with the non-commutative nature of translation\nand rotation in visual scenes, when both are used in combination; (3) the\ndesign of a multi-compartment spiking phasor neuron model for implementing\ncomplex-valued vector binding on neuromorphic hardware. The VSA framework uses\nvector binding operations to produce generative image models in which binding\nacts as the equivariant operation for geometric transformations. A scene can\ntherefore be described as a sum of vector products, which in turn can be\nefficiently factorized by a resonator network to infer objects and their poses.\nThe HRN enables the definition of a partitioned architecture in which vector\nbinding is equivariant for horizontal and vertical translation within one\npartition, and for rotation and scaling within the other partition. The spiking\nneuron model allows to map the resonator network onto efficient and low-power\nneuromorphic hardware. In this work, we demonstrate our approach using\nsynthetic scenes composed of simple 2D shapes undergoing rigid geometric\ntransformations and color changes. A companion paper demonstrates this approach\nin real-world application scenarios for machine vision and robotics.",

Although\nresearchers have proposed many techniques to detect HTs, several limitations\nexist, including: (i) a low success rate, (ii) high algorithmic complexity, and\n(iii) a large number of test patterns. Furthermore, the most pertinent drawback\nof prior detection techniques stems from an incorrect evaluation methodology,\ni.e., they assume that an adversary inserts HTs randomly. Such inappropriate\nadversarial assumptions enable detection techniques to claim high HT detection\naccuracy, leading to a \"false sense of security.\" Unfortunately, to the best of\nour knowledge, despite more than a decade of research on detecting HTs inserted\nduring fabrication, there have been no concerted efforts to perform a\nsystematic evaluation of HT detection techniques.\nIn this paper, we play the role of a realistic adversary and question the\nefficacy of HT detection techniques by developing an automated, scalable, and\npractical attack framework, ATTRITION, using reinforcement learning (RL).\nATTRITION evades eight detection techniques across two HT detection categories,\nshowcasing its agnostic behavior. ATTRITION achieves average attack success\nrates of $47\\times$ and $211\\times$ compared to randomly inserted HTs against\nstate-of-the-art HT detection techniques.

    "abstract": "As an emerging technology in the era of Industry 4.0, digital twin is gaining\nunprecedented attention because of its promise to further optimize process\ndesign, quality control, health monitoring, decision and policy making, and\nmore, by comprehensively modeling the physical world as a group of\ninterconnected digital models. In a two-part series of papers, we examine the\nfundamental role of different modeling techniques, twinning enabling\ntechnologies, and uncertainty quantification and optimization methods commonly\nused in digital twins. This second paper presents a literature review of key\nenabling technologies of digital twins, with an emphasis on uncertainty\nquantification, optimization methods, open source datasets and tools, major\nfindings, challenges, and future directions. Discussions focus on current\nmethods of uncertainty quantification and optimization and how they are applied\nin different dimensions of a digital twin. Additionally, this paper presents a\ncase study where a battery digital twin is constructed and tested to illustrate\nsome of the modeling and twinning methods reviewed in this two-part review.\nCode and preprocessed data for generating all the results and figures presented\nin the case study are available on GitHub.",

    "abstract": "Existing methods of multiple human parsing usually adopt a two-stage strategy\n(typically top-down and bottom-up), which suffers from either strong dependence\non prior detection or highly computational redundancy during post-grouping. In\nthis work, we present an end-to-end multiple human parsing framework using\nrepresentative parts, termed RepParser. Different from mainstream methods,\nRepParser solves the multiple human parsing in a new single-stage manner\nwithout resorting to person detection or post-grouping.To this end, RepParser\ndecouples the parsing pipeline into instance-aware kernel generation and\npart-aware human parsing, which are responsible for instance separation and\ninstance-specific part segmentation, respectively. In particular, we empower\nthe parsing pipeline by representative parts, since they are characterized by\ninstance-aware keypoints and can be utilized to dynamically parse each person\ninstance. Specifically, representative parts are obtained by jointly localizing\ncenters of instances and estimating keypoints of body part regions. After that,\nwe dynamically predict instance-aware convolution kernels through\nrepresentative parts, thus encoding person-part context into each kernel\nresponsible for casting an image feature as an instance-specific\nrepresentation.Furthermore, a multi-branch structure is adopted to divide each\ninstance-specific representation into several part-aware representations for\nseparate part segmentation.In this way, RepParser accordingly focuses on person\ninstances with the guidance of representative parts and directly outputs\nparsing results for each person instance, thus eliminating the requirement of\nthe prior detection or post-grouping.Extensive experiments on two challenging\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our proposed RepParser is a simple yet effective\nframework and achieves very competitive performance.",

    "title": "Pipeline-Invariant Representation Learning for Neuroimaging",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has been widely applied in neuroimaging, including to\npredicting brain-phenotype relationships from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nvolumes. MRI data usually requires extensive preprocessing before it is ready\nfor modeling, even via deep learning, in part due to its high dimensionality\nand heterogeneity. A growing array of MRI preprocessing pipelines have been\ndeveloped each with its own strengths and limitations. Recent studies have\nshown that pipeline-related variation may lead to different scientific\nfindings, even when using the identical data. Meanwhile, the machine learning\ncommunity has emphasized the importance of shifting from model-centric to\ndata-centric approaches given that data quality plays an essential role in deep\nlearning applications. Motivated by this idea, we first evaluate how\npreprocessing pipeline selection can impact the downstream performance of a\nsupervised learning model. We next propose two pipeline-invariant\nrepresentation learning methodologies, MPSL and PXL, to improve consistency in\nclassification performance and to capture similar neural network\nrepresentations between pipeline pairs. Using 2000 human subjects from the UK\nBiobank dataset, we demonstrate that both models present unique advantages, in\nparticular that MPSL can be used to improve out-of-sample generalization to new\npipelines, while PXL can be used to improve predictive performance consistency\nand representational similarity within a closed pipeline set. These results\nsuggest that our proposed models can be applied to overcome pipeline-related\nbiases and to improve reproducibility in neuroimaging prediction tasks.",

    "abstract": "Demand-side management is very critical in China's energy systems because of\nits high fossil energy consumption and low system energy efficiency. A building\nshape factor is introduced in describing the architectural characteristics of\ndifferent functional areas, which are combined with the characteristics of the\nenergy consumed by users to investigate the features of heating load in\ndifferent functional areas. A Stackelberg game-based optimal scheduling model\nis proposed for electro-thermal integrated energy systems, which seeks to\nmaximize the revenue of integrated energy operator (IEO) and minimize the cost\nof users. Here, IEO and users are the Stackelberg game leader and followers,\nrespectively. The leader uses real-time energy prices to guide loads to\nparticipate in demand response, while the followers make energy plans based on\nprice feedback. Using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition and the big-M\nmethod, the model is transformed into a mixed-integer quadratic programming\n(MIQP) problem, which is solved by using MATLAB and CPLEX software. The results\ndemonstrate that the proposal manages to balance the interests of IEO and\nusers.

However, the planning and layout of charging\nstations is affected by various complex factors such as policy economy,\ncharging demand, user charging comfort, and road traffic conditions. How to\nweigh various factors to construct a reasonable model of charging station\nlocation and capacity has become a major difficulty in the field of electric\nvehicle charging facility planning. Firstly, this paper constructs the location\nand capacity optimization model of the charging station with the goal of\nmaximizing the revenue of operators and minimizing the user's charging\nadditional cost. At the same time, the road time-consuming index is introduced\nto quantify the impact of road congestion on the user's charging additional\ncost, so as to effectively improve the user's satisfaction during charging.\nThen, aiming at the charging station planning model, a non-dominated sorting\ngenetic algorithm with an elite strategy (NSGA-II) based on chaos\ninitialization and arithmetic crossover operator is proposed. Finally, taking\nthe Haidian District of Beijing as the simulation object, the results show that\ncompared with the situation of urban traffic networks not considered, the model\nproposed in this paper significantly reduces the cost of lost time of users by\n11.4% and the total additional cost of users' charging by 7.6%. It not only\nensures the economy of the system, but also effectively improves the charging\nsatisfaction of users, which further verifies the feasibility and effectiveness\nof the model, and can provide a reference for the planning and layout of\ncharging stations in the future.",

In particular, pose estimation of space objects is achieved using 3D\nvision data in an integrated Kalman filter (KF) and an Iterative Closest Point\n(ICP) algorithm in a closed-loop configuration. The initial guess for the\ninternal ICP iteration is provided by the state estimate propagation of the\nKalman filer. The Kalman filter is capable of not only estimating the target's\nstates but also its inertial parameters. This allows the motion of the target\nto be predictable as soon as the filter converges. Consequently, the ICP can\nmaintain pose tracking over a wider range of velocity due to the increased\nprecision of ICP initialization. Furthermore, incorporation of the target's\ndynamics model in the estimation process allows the estimator continuously\nprovide pose estimation even when the sensor temporally loses its signal namely\ndue to obstruction. The capabilities of the pose estimation methodology is\ndemonstrated by a ground testbed for Automated Rendezvous & Docking. In this\nexperiment, Neptec's Laser Camera System (LCS) is used for real-time scanning\nof a satellite model attached to a manipulator arm, which is driven by a\nsimulator according to orbital and attitude dynamics.

We show learning tasks for which computationally\nbounded learners need \\emph{significantly more} model parameters than what\ninformation-theoretic learners need. Furthermore, we show that even more model\nparameters could be necessary for robust learning. In particular, for\ncomputationally bounded learners, we extend the recent result of Bubeck and\nSellke [NeurIPS'2021] which shows that robust models might need more\nparameters, to the computational regime and show that bounded learners could\nprovably need an even larger number of parameters. Then, we address the\nfollowing related question: can we hope to remedy the situation for robust\ncomputationally bounded learning by restricting \\emph{adversaries} to also be\ncomputationally bounded for sake of obtaining models with fewer parameters?\nHere again, we show that this could be possible. Specifically, building on the\nwork of Garg, Jha, Mahloujifar, and Mahmoody [ALT'2020], we demonstrate a\nlearning task that can be learned efficiently and robustly against a\ncomputationally bounded attacker, while to be robust against an\ninformation-theoretic attacker requires the learner to utilize significantly\nmore parameters.",

The texture is then imparted on the UV atlas\nin a hybrid fashion by first projecting pixels from the input image to UV space\nfor the visible region, followed by inpainting the occluded regions. Thus, we\nare able to digitize arbitrarily loose clothing styles while retaining\nhigh-frequency textural details from a monocular image. We achieve\nhigh-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction results on three publicly available\ndatasets and generalization on internet images.",

    "abstract": "Due to the decentralized and public nature of the Blockchain ecosystem, the\nmalicious activities on the Ethereum platform impose immeasurable losses for\nthe users. Existing phishing scam detection methods mostly rely only on the\nanalysis of original transaction networks, which is difficult to dig deeply\ninto the transaction patterns hidden in the network structure of transaction\ninteraction. In this paper, we propose a \\underline{T}ransaction\n\\underline{S}ub\\underline{G}raph \\underline{N}etwork (TSGN) based phishing\naccounts identification framework for Ethereum. We first extract transaction\nsubgraphs for target accounts and then expand these subgraphs into\ncorresponding TSGNs based on the different mapping mechanisms. In order to make\nour model incorporate more important information about real transactions, we\nencode the transaction attributes into the modeling process of TSGNs, yielding\ntwo variants of TSGN, i.e., Directed-TSGN and Temporal-TSGN, which can be\napplied to the different attributed networks. Especially, by introducing TSGN\ninto multi-edge transaction networks, the Multiple-TSGN model proposed is able\nto preserve the temporal transaction flow information and capture the\nsignificant topological pattern of phishing scams, while reducing the time\ncomplexity of modeling large-scale networks. Extensive experimental results\nshow that TSGN models can provide more potential information to improve the\nperformance of phishing detection by incorporating graph representation\nlearning.",

    "abstract": "The success of deep learning on video Action Recognition (AR) has motivated\nresearchers to progressively promote related tasks from the coarse level to the\nfine-grained level. Compared with conventional AR that only predicts an action\nlabel for the entire video, Temporal Action Detection (TAD) has been\ninvestigated for estimating the start and end time for each action in videos.\nTaking TAD a step further, Spatiotemporal Action Detection (SAD) has been\nstudied for localizing the action both spatially and temporally in videos.\nHowever, who performs the action, is generally ignored in SAD, while\nidentifying the actor could also be important. To this end, we propose a novel\ntask, Actor-identified Spatiotemporal Action Detection (ASAD), to bridge the\ngap between SAD and actor identification.\nIn ASAD, we not only detect the spatiotemporal boundary for instance-level\naction but also assign the unique ID to each actor. To approach ASAD, Multiple\nObject Tracking (MOT) and Action Classification (AC) are two fundamental\nelements. By using MOT, the spatiotemporal boundary of each actor is obtained\nand assigned to a unique actor identity. By using AC, the action class is\nestimated within the corresponding spatiotemporal boundary. Since ASAD is a new\ntask, it poses many new challenges that cannot be addressed by existing\nmethods: i) no dataset is specifically created for ASAD, ii) no evaluation\nmetrics are designed for ASAD, iii) current MOT performance is the bottleneck\nto obtain satisfactory ASAD results. To address those problems, we contribute\nto i) annotate a new ASAD dataset, ii) propose ASAD evaluation metrics by\nconsidering multi-label actions and actor identification, iii) improve the data\nassociation strategies in MOT to boost the MOT performance, which leads to\nbetter ASAD results.

However,\nexisting analyzers are not sufficient to analyze the financial security of\nmassive contracts precisely. In this paper, we propose and implement FASVERIF,\nan automated analyzer for fine-grained analysis of smart contracts' financial\nsecurity.

Specifically, we propose two\ntypes of security properties, invariant properties and equivalence properties,\nwhich can be used to detect various types of finance-related vulnerabilities\nand can be automatically generated based on our statistical analysis. As a\nresult, FASVERIF can automatically process source code of smart contracts, and\nuses formal methods whenever possible to simultaneously maximize its accuracy.\nWe also prove the soundness of verifying our properties using our translated\nmodel based on a custom semantics of Solidity.\nWe evaluate FASVERIF on a vulnerabilities dataset of 548 contracts by\ncomparing it with other automatic tools.

    "abstract": "Modern power systems are facing the tremendous challenge of integrating vast\namounts of variable (non-dispatchable) renewable generation capacity, such as\nsolar photovoltaic or wind power. In this context, the required power system\nflexibility needs to be allocated in other units that can include energy\nstorage, demand management or providing reserve from renewables curtailing the\noutput power. The present paper proposes the new concept of grid-forming load,\nwhich can be considered a totally flexible concept of demand. The concept is\nnot only ensuring the load is supporting the grid stability by adapting the\nload to the overall system balancing, but also ensures that the load is\nactually contributing to form the grid and to provide synchronization power to\nthe overall system. In this sense, the new concept allows running a system\npowered only by renewables operating at maximum power (or operator defined\nset-point) in grid-following mode, while the overall system control is ubicated\nin the demand side. This is an important change of paradigm as it considers\nthat all the flexibility, synchronism and stability provision is on the demand\nside. This concept can applied either to isolated systems or also to future\npower systems, where millions of loads steer the power system while the\nrenewables are operating at full power. The paper proposes the concept,\nsuggests possible control implementations of the grid-forming load and analyses\nthe concept in four simulation case studies.",

In the proposed\nCIM-SR-DCSK-CC system, the source transmits information bits to both the relay\nand destination in the first time slot, while the relay not only forwards the\nsource information bits but also sends new information bits to the destination\nin the second time slot. To be specific, the relay employs an $N$-order Walsh\ncode to carry additional ${{\\log }_{2}}N$ information bits, which are\nsuperimposed onto the SR-DCSK signal carrying the decoded source information\nbits. Subsequently, the superimposed signal carrying both the source and relay\ninformation bits is transmitted to the destination. Moreover, the theoretical\nbit error rate (BER) expressions of the proposed CIM-SR-DCSK-CC system are\nderived over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading\nchannels. Compared with the conventional DCSK-CC system and SR-DCSK-CC system,\nthe proposed CIM-SR-DCSK-CC system can significantly improve the throughput\nwithout deteriorating any BER performance.

Several recent studies have explored such use-cases.

    "abstract": "RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) is widely exploited in building key-value\nstores to achieve ultra low latency. In RDMA-based key-value stores, the\nindexing time takes a large fraction (up to 74%) of the overall operation\nlatency as RDMA enables fast data accesses. However, the single index structure\nused in existing RDMA-based key-value stores, either hash-based or sorted\nindex, fails to support range queries efficiently while achieving high\nperformance for single-point operations. In this paper, we reconsider the\nadoption of hybrid index in the key-value stores based on RDMA, to combine the\nbenefits of hash table and sorted index. We propose HiStore, an RDMA-based\nkey-value store using hash table for single-point lookups and leveraging\nskiplist for range queries. To maintain strong consistency in a lightweight and\nefficient approach, HiStore introduces index groups where a skiplist\ncorresponds to a hash table, and asynchronously applies updates to the skiplist\nwithin a group. Guided by previous work on using RDMA for key-value services,\nHiStore dedicatedly chooses different RDMA primitives to optimize the read and\nwrite performance. Furthermore, HiStore tolerates the failures of servers that\nmaintain index structures with index replication for high availability. Our\nevaluation results demonstrate that HiStore improves the performance of both\nGET and SCAN operations (by up to 2.03x) with hybrid index.",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an efficient computational mechanism\nfor temporal signal processing, especially when coupled with low-power SNN\ninference ASICs. SNNs have been historically difficult to configure, lacking a\ngeneral method for finding solutions for arbitrary tasks. In recent years,\ngradient-descent optimization methods have been applied to SNNs with increasing\nease. SNNs and SNN inference processors therefore offer a good platform for\ncommercial low-power signal processing in energy constrained environments\nwithout cloud dependencies. However, to date these methods have not been\naccessible to ML engineers in industry, requiring graduate-level training to\nsuccessfully configure a single SNN application. Here we demonstrate a\nconvenient high-level pipeline to design, train and deploy arbitrary temporal\nsignal processing applications to sub-mW SNN inference hardware. We apply a new\nstraightforward SNN architecture designed for temporal signal processing, using\na pyramid of synaptic time constants to extract signal features at a range of\ntemporal scales. We demonstrate this architecture on an ambient audio\nclassification task, deployed to the Xylo SNN inference processor in streaming\nmode. Our application achieves high accuracy (98%) and low latency (100ms) at\nlow power (<4muW inference power). Our approach makes training and deploying\nSNN applications available to ML engineers with general NN backgrounds, without\nrequiring specific prior experience with spiking NNs. We intend for our\napproach to make Neuromorphic hardware and SNNs an attractive choice for\ncommercial low-power and edge signal processing applications.",

In recent years,\na number of learning-based Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) systems\nrelying on deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proposed for applications\nwhere conventional feature descriptors do not perform well.

However, modern algorithms are data hungry and\nit is not always possible to gather enough data to apply the best performing\nsupervised approaches. Since data collection is an expensive and cumbersome\ntask, the enabling technologies for using computer vision in agriculture are\noften out of reach for small businesses. Following previous work in this\ncontext, where we proposed an initial weakly supervised solution to reduce the\ndata needed to get state-of-the-art detection and segmentation in precision\nagriculture applications, here we improve that system and explore the problem\nof tracking fruits in orchards. We present the case of vineyards of table\ngrapes in southern Lazio (Italy) since grapes are a difficult fruit to segment\ndue to occlusion, color and general illumination conditions. We consider the\ncase when there is some initial labelled data that could work as source data\n(e.g. wine grape data), but it is considerably different from the target data\n(e.g. table grape data). To improve detection and segmentation on the target\ndata, we propose to train the segmentation algorithm with a weak bounding box\nlabel, while for tracking we leverage 3D Structure from Motion algorithms to\ngenerate new labels from already labelled samples. Finally, the two systems are\ncombined in a full semi-supervised approach.

Edge\ndiffraction is modeled using the uniform theory of diffraction. For simplicity,\nwe limit our attention to domains with piecewise linear boundaries and a\nconstant speed of sound. The domain is discretized into a conforming\ntetrahedron mesh. For the eikonal equation, we extend the jet marching method\nto tetrahedron meshes. Hermite interpolation enables second order accuracy for\nthe eikonal and its gradient and first order accuracy for its Hessian, computed\nusing cell averaging. To march the eikonal on an unstructured mesh, we\nintroduce a new method of rejecting unphysical updates by considering Lagrange\nmultipliers and local visibility. To handle accuracy degradation near caustics,\nwe introduce several fast Lagrangian initialization algorithms.

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict the subsequent behaviors of\nusers by understanding their successive historical behaviors. Recently, some\nmethods for SR are devoted to alleviating the data sparsity problem (i.e.,\nlimited supervised signals for training), which take account of contrastive\nlearning to incorporate self-supervised signals into SR. Despite their\nachievements, it is far from enough to learn informative user/item embeddings\ndue to the inadequacy modeling of complex collaborative information and\nco-action information, such as user-item relation, user-user relation, and\nitem-item relation. In this paper, we study the problem of SR and propose a\nnovel multi-level contrastive learning framework for sequential recommendation,\nnamed MCLSR. Different from the previous contrastive learning-based methods for\nSR, MCLSR learns the representations of users and items through a cross-view\ncontrastive learning paradigm from four specific views at two different levels\n(i.e., interest- and feature-level). Specifically, the interest-level\ncontrastive mechanism jointly learns the collaborative information with the\nsequential transition patterns, and the feature-level contrastive mechanism\nre-observes the relation between users and items via capturing the co-action\ninformation (i.e., co-occurrence). Extensive experiments on four real-world\ndatasets show that the proposed MCLSR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods\nconsistently.",

The existing work\non Lagrangean algorithms to the NP-hard problem of finding minimum weight\nstable spanning trees is limited to relaxations with the integrality property.\nWe exploit a new relaxation of this problem: fixed cardinality stable sets in\nthe underlying conflict graph $H =(E,C)$. We find interesting properties of the\ncorresponding polytope, and determine stronger dual bounds in a Lagrangean\ndecomposition framework, optimizing over the spanning tree polytope of $G$ and\nthe fixed cardinality stable set polytope of $H$ in the subproblems. This is\nequivalent to dualizing exponentially many subtour elimination constraints,\nwhile limiting the number of multipliers in the dual problem to $|E|$. It is\nalso a proof of concept for combining Lagrangean relaxation with the power of\nMILP solvers over strongly NP-hard subproblems.

However, existing\napproaches suffer from the aesthetic-unrealistic problem that introduces\ndisharmonious patterns and evident artifacts, making the results easy to spot\nfrom real paintings. To address this limitation, we propose AesUST, a novel\nAesthetic-enhanced Universal Style Transfer approach that can generate\naesthetically more realistic and pleasing results for arbitrary styles.\nSpecifically, our approach introduces an aesthetic discriminator to learn the\nuniversal human-delightful aesthetic features from a large corpus of\nartist-created paintings. Then, the aesthetic features are incorporated to\nenhance the style transfer process via a novel Aesthetic-aware Style-Attention\n(AesSA) module. Such an AesSA module enables our AesUST to efficiently and\nflexibly integrate the style patterns according to the global aesthetic channel\ndistribution of the style image and the local semantic spatial distribution of\nthe content image. Moreover, we also develop a new two-stage transfer training\nstrategy with two aesthetic regularizations to train our model more\neffectively, further improving stylization performance. Extensive experiments\nand user studies demonstrate that our approach synthesizes aesthetically more\nharmonious and realistic results than state of the art, greatly narrowing the\ndisparity with real artist-created paintings.

    "abstract": "One of the biggest criticisms of the Set Shaping Theory is the lack of a\npractical application. This is due to the difficulty of its application. In\nfact, to apply this technique from an experimental point of view we must use a\ntable that defines the correspondences between two sets. However, this approach\nis not usable in practice, because the table has A^N elements, with A number of\nsymbols and N length of the message to be encoded. Consequently, these tables\ncan be implemented in a program only when A and N have a low value.\nUnfortunately, in these cases, there are no compression algorithms with such\nefficiency as to detect the improvement introduced by this method. In this\narticle, we use a function capable of performing the transform without using\nthe correspondence table; this allows us to apply this theory to a wide range\nof values of A and N. The results obtained confirm the theoretical predictions.",

First, we introduce the\nter-mination tags formalism required to build a language model based on a link\ngrammar formalism of Sleator and Temperley [21] and discuss the influence of\ncontext on the unsupervised learning of link grammars. Second, we pro-pose a\nstatistical link grammar formalism, allowing for statistical language\ngeneration. Third, based on the above formalism, we show that the classical\ndissertation of Yuret [25] on discovery of linguistic relations using lexical\nat-traction ignores contextual properties of the language, and thus the\napproach to unsupervised language learning relying just on bigrams is flawed.\nThis correlates well with the unimpressive results in unsupervised training of\ngraph language models based on bigram approach of Yuret.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider how to partition the parity-check matrices (PCMs)\nto reduce the hardware complexity and computation delay for the row layered\ndecoding of quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes. First, we\nformulate the PCM partitioning as an optimization problem, which targets to\nminimize the maximum column weight of each layer while maintaining a block\ncyclic shift property among different layers. As a result, we derive all the\nfeasible solutions for the problem and propose a tight lower bound\n$\\omega_{LB}$ on the minimum possible maximum column weight to evaluate a\nsolution. Second, we define a metric called layer distance to measure the data\ndependency between consecutive layers and further illustrate how to identify\nthe solutions with desired layer distance from those achieving the minimum\nvalue of $\\omega_{LB}=1$, which is preferred to reduce computation delay. Next,\nwe demonstrate that up-to-now, finding an optimal solution for the optimization\nproblem with polynomial time complexity is unachievable. Therefore, both\nenumerative and greedy partition algorithms are proposed instead. After that,\nwe modify the quasi-cyclic progressive edge-growth (QC-PEG) algorithm to\ndirectly construct PCMs that have a straightforward partition scheme to achieve\n$\\omega_{LB} $ or the desired layer distance. Simulation results showed that\nthe constructed codes have better error correction performance and smaller\naverage number of iterations than the underlying 5G LDPC code.",

The existing debris flow warning system in Taiwan, which uses a\ntime-weighted measure of rainfall, leads to alerts when the measure exceeds a\npredefined threshold. However, this system generates many false alarms and\nmisses a substantial fraction of the actual debris flows. Towards improving\nthis system, we implemented five machine learning models that input historical\nrainfall data and predict whether a debris flow will occur within a selected\ntime. We found that a random forest model performed the best among the five\nmodels and outperformed the existing system in Taiwan. Furthermore, we\nidentified the rainfall trajectories strongly related to debris flow\noccurrences and explored trade-offs between the risks of missing debris flows\nversus frequent false alerts.

This surge in DeFi's popularity has, unfortunately, been\naccompanied by many impactful incidents. According to our data, users,\nliquidity providers, speculators, and protocol operators suffered a total loss\nof at least 3.24 USD from Apr 30, 2018 to Apr 30, 2022.

We also investigate potential defenses, and find that:\n(i) 103 (56%) of the attacks are not executed atomically, granting a rescue\ntime frame for defenders; (ii) SoTA bytecode similarity analysis can at least\ndetect 31 vulnerable/23 adversarial contracts; and (iii) 33 (15.3%) of the\nadversaries leak potentially identifiable information by interacting with\ncentralized exchanges.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the limitations of current over-parameterized shadow\nremoval models. We present a novel lightweight deep neural network that\nprocesses shadow images in the LAB color space. The proposed network termed\n\"LAB-Net\", is motivated by the following three observations: First, the LAB\ncolor space can well separate the luminance information and color properties.\nSecond, sequentially-stacked convolutional layers fail to take full use of\nfeatures from different receptive fields. Third, non-shadow regions are\nimportant prior knowledge to diminish the drastic color difference between\nshadow and non-shadow regions. Consequently, we design our LAB-Net by involving\na two-branch structure: L and AB branches. Thus the shadow-related luminance\ninformation can well be processed in the L branch, while the color property is\nwell retained in the AB branch. In addition, each branch is composed of several\nBasic Blocks, local spatial attention modules (LSA), and convolutional filters.\nEach Basic Block consists of multiple parallelized dilated convolutions of\ndivergent dilation rates to receive different receptive fields that are\noperated with distinct network widths to save model parameters and\ncomputational costs. Then, an enhanced channel attention module (ECA) is\nconstructed to aggregate features from different receptive fields for better\nshadow removal. Finally, the LSA modules are further developed to fully use the\nprior information in non-shadow regions to cleanse the shadow regions. We\nperform extensive experiments on the both ISTD and SRD datasets. Experimental\nresults show that our LAB-Net well outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Also,\nour model's parameters and computational costs are reduced by several orders of\nmagnitude. Our code is available at https://github.com/ngrxmu/LAB-Net.",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance\nin various vision-related tasks. The success of ViTs motivates adversaries to\nperform backdoor attacks on ViTs. Although the vulnerability of traditional\nCNNs to backdoor attacks is well-known, backdoor attacks on ViTs are\nseldom-studied. Compared to CNNs capturing pixel-wise local features by\nconvolutions, ViTs extract global context information through patches and\nattentions. Na\\\"ively transplanting CNN-specific backdoor attacks to ViTs\nyields only a low clean data accuracy and a low attack success rate. In this\npaper, we propose a stealth and practical ViT-specific backdoor attack\n$TrojViT$. Rather than an area-wise trigger used by CNN-specific backdoor\nattacks, TrojViT generates a patch-wise trigger designed to build a Trojan\ncomposed of some vulnerable bits on the parameters of a ViT stored in DRAM\nmemory through patch salience ranking and attention-target loss. TrojViT\nfurther uses minimum-tuned parameter update to reduce the bit number of the\nTrojan. Once the attacker inserts the Trojan into the ViT model by flipping the\nvulnerable bits, the ViT model still produces normal inference accuracy with\nbenign inputs. But when the attacker embeds a trigger into an input, the ViT\nmodel is forced to classify the input to a predefined target class. We show\nthat flipping only few vulnerable bits identified by TrojViT on a ViT model\nusing the well-known RowHammer can transform the model into a backdoored one.\nWe perform extensive experiments of multiple datasets on various ViT models.\nTrojViT can classify $99.64\\%$ of test images to a target class by flipping\n$345$ bits on a ViT for ImageNet.",

Firstly, the issues concerning the semantic persistency of\nontology concepts and their flexible reuse in domain development employing\nexisting approaches. Secondly, due to the difficulty in understanding and\nreusing top-level concepts in existing foundational ontologies, the obfuscation\nregarding the semantic nature of domain representations. The paper grounds the\naforementioned shortcomings in representation diversity and proposes a\nthree-fold solution - (i) a pipeline for rendering concepts reuse-ready, (ii) a\nfirst characterization of a minimalistic foundational knowledge model, named\nfoundational teleology, semantically explicating foundational distinctions\nenforcing the static as well as dynamic nature of domain representations, and\n(iii) a flexible, reuse-native methodology for diversity-aware domain\ndevelopment exploiting solutions (i) and (ii). The preliminary work reported\nvalidates the potentiality of the solution components.",

    "title": "SA: Sliding attack for synthetic speech detection with resistance to  clipping and self-splicing",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples that mislead\nmodels with imperceptible perturbations. In audio, although adversarial\nexamples have achieved incredible attack success rates on white-box settings\nand black-box settings, most existing adversarial attacks are constrained by\nthe input length. A More practical scenario is that the adversarial examples\nmust be clipped or self-spliced and input into the black-box model. Therefore,\nit is necessary to explore how to improve transferability in different input\nlength settings. In this paper, we take the synthetic speech detection task as\nan example and consider two representative SOTA models. We observe that the\ngradients of fragments with the same sample value are similar in different\nmodels via analyzing the gradients obtained by feeding samples into the model\nafter cropping or self-splicing. Inspired by the above observation, we propose\na new adversarial attack method termed sliding attack. Specifically, we make\neach sampling point aware of gradients at different locations, which can\nsimulate the situation where adversarial examples are input to black-box models\nwith varying input lengths. Therefore, instead of using the current gradient\ndirectly in each iteration of the gradient calculation, we go through the\nfollowing three steps. First, we extract subsegments of different lengths using\nsliding windows. We then augment the subsegments with data from the adjacent\ndomains. Finally, we feed the sub-segments into different models to obtain\naggregate gradients to update adversarial examples. Empirical results\ndemonstrate that our method could significantly improve the transferability of\nadversarial examples after clipping or self-splicing. Besides, our method could\nalso enhance the transferability between models based on different features.",

    "abstract": "Developers are increasingly using function-as-a-service (FaaS) platforms for\ndata-centric applications that primarily perform low-latency and transactional\noperations on data, such as for microservices or web serving workloads.\nUnfortunately, existing and recently proposed FaaS platforms support these\napplications poorly because they separate application logic, executed in cloud\nfunctions, from data management, done in interactive transactions accessing\nremote storage. This separation harms performance and makes it difficult to\nefficiently provide transactional guarantees.\nWe present Apiary, a novel DBMS-backed transactional FaaS framework for\ndata-centric applications. Apiary tightly integrates application logic and data\nmanagement, building a unified runtime for function execution and data\nmanagement by wrapping a distributed database engine and its stored procedures.\nApiary augments the DBMS with scheduling and tracing layers, providing a\nworkflow programming interface for composing functions into larger programs\nwith end-to-end exactly-once semantics, cross-function transactions, and\nadvanced observability capabilities. In addition to offering more features and\nstronger guarantees than existing FaaS platforms, Apiary outperforms them by\n2-68x on microservice workloads by greatly reducing communication and\ncoordination overhead and using cluster resources more efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Face presentation attack detection (PAD) plays an important role in defending\nface recognition systems against presentation attacks. The success of PAD\nlargely relies on supervised learning that requires a huge number of labeled\ndata, which is especially challenging for videos and often requires expert\nknowledge. To avoid the costly collection of labeled data, this paper presents\na novel method for self-supervised video representation learning via motion\nprediction. To achieve this, we exploit the temporal consistency based on three\nRGB frames which are acquired at three different times in the video sequence.\nThe obtained frames are then transformed into grayscale images where each image\nis specified to three different channels such as R(red), G(green), and B(blue)\nto form a dynamic grayscale snippet (DGS). Motivated by this, the labels are\nautomatically generated to increase the temporal diversity based on DGS by\nusing the different temporal lengths of the videos, which prove to be very\nhelpful for the downstream task. Benefiting from the self-supervised nature of\nour method, we report the results that outperform existing methods on four\npublic benchmark datasets, namely Replay-Attack, MSU-MFSD, CASIA-FASD, and\nOULU-NPU. Explainability analysis has been carried out through LIME and\nGrad-CAM techniques to visualize the most important features used in the DGS.",

The intuition\nbehind the approaches proposed in this paper is to partition the dataset into\nhomogeneous clusters and select some images which contribute significantly to\nthe accuracy. Selected images are the proper subset of the training data and\nthus are human-readable. We propose four variations upon the baseline\nalgorithm-RHC. The intuition behind the first approach, RHCKON, is that the\nboundary points contribute significantly towards the representation of\nclusters. It involves selecting k farthest and one nearest neighbour of the\ncentroid of the clusters. In the following two approaches (KONCW and CWKC), we\nintroduce the concept of cluster weights. They are based on the fact that\nlarger clusters contribute more than smaller sized clusters. The final\nvariation is GHCIDR which selects points based on the geometrical aspect of\ndata distribution. We performed the experiments on two deep learning models-\nFully Connected Networks (FCN) and VGG1. We experimented with the four variants\non three datasets- MNIST, CIFAR10, and Fashion-MNIST.

A potential solution to this problem is to deploy off-the-shelf sparse\nlearning algorithms that train a binary sparse mask on each client with the\nexpectation of training a consistent sparse server mask. However, as we\ninvestigate in this paper, such naive deployments result in a significant\naccuracy drop compared to FL with dense models, especially under low client's\nresource budget. In particular, our investigations reveal a serious lack of\nconsensus among the trained masks on clients, which prevents convergence on the\nserver mask and potentially leads to a substantial drop in model performance.\nBased on such key observations, we propose federated lottery aware sparsity\nhunting (FLASH), a unified sparse learning framework to make the server win a\nlottery in terms of a sparse sub-model, which can greatly improve performance\nunder highly resource-limited client settings. Moreover, to address the issue\nof device heterogeneity, we leverage our findings to propose hetero-FLASH,\nwhere clients can have different target sparsity budgets based on their device\nresource limits.

    "abstract": "People post information about different topics which are in their active\nvocabulary over social media platforms (like Twitter, Facebook, PInterest and\nGoogle+). They follow each other and it is more likely that the person who\nposts information about current happenings will receive better response. Manual\nanalysis of huge amount of data on social media platforms is difficult. This\nhas opened new research directions for automatic analysis of usercontributed\nsocial media documents. Automatic social media data analysis is difficult due\nto abundant information shared by users. Many researchers use Twitter data for\nSocial Media Analysis (SMA) as the Twitter data is freely available in the\npublic domain. One of the most this research work. Event Detection from social\nmedia data is used for different applications like traffic congestion\ndetection, disaster and emergency management, and live news detection. Nature\nof the information which is shared on twitter platform is short-text, noisy,\nand ambiguous. Thus, event detection and extraction of event phrases from\nuser-generated and illformed data becomes challenging. To address these\nchallenges, events are extracted from streaming social media data in the form\nof keyphrases using different cognitive properties. The motivation behind this\nresearch work is to provide substantial improvements in the lexical variation\nof event phrases while detecting events and sub-events from twitter data. In\nthis research work, the approach towards event detection from social media data\nis divided into three phases namely: Identifying sub-graphs in Microblog Word\nCo-occurrence Network (WCN) which provides important information about\nkeyphrases; Identifying multiple events from social media data; and Ranking\ncontextual information of event phrases.",

The ground-breaking techniques\ndeveloped in those work are from algebraic geometry: \"We believe that behind\nany log-concave sequence that appears in nature there is such a Hodge structure\nresponsible for the log-concavity\".\nA function is called completely monotone if its derivatives alternate in\nsigns; e.g., $e^{-t}$. A fundamental conjecture in mathematical physics and\nShannon information theory is on the complete monotonicity of Gaussian\ndistribution (GCMC), which states that $I(X+Z_t)$\\footnote{The probability\ndensity function of $X+Z_t$ is called \"heat flow\" in mathematical physics.} is\ncompletely monotone in $t$, where $I$ is Fisher information, random variables\n$X$ and $Z_t$ are independent and $Z_t\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,t)$ is Gaussian.\nInspired by the algebraic geometry method introduced by J. Huh, GCMC is\nreformulated in the form of a log-convex sequence. In general, a completely\nmonotone function can admit a log-convex sequence and a log-convex sequence can\nfurther induce a log-concave sequence. The new formulation may guide GCMC to\nthe marvelous temple of algebraic geometry.

Machine learning (ML)\npractitioners use AutoML tools to automate and optimize the process of feature\nengineering, model training, and hyperparameter optimization and so on. Recent\nwork performed qualitative studies on practitioners' experiences of using\nAutoML tools and compared different AutoML tools based on their performance and\nprovided features, but none of the existing work studied the practices of using\nAutoML tools in real-world projects at a large scale. Therefore, we conducted\nan empirical study to understand how ML practitioners use AutoML tools in their\nprojects. To this end, we examined the top 10 most used AutoML tools and their\nrespective usages in a large number of open-source project repositories hosted\non GitHub. The results of our study show 1) which AutoML tools are mostly used\nby ML practitioners and 2) the characteristics of the repositories that use\nthese AutoML tools. Also, we identified the purpose of using AutoML tools (e.g.\nmodel parameter sampling, search space management, model\nevaluation/error-analysis, Data/ feature transformation, and data labeling) and\nthe stages of the ML pipeline (e.g. feature engineering) where AutoML tools are\nused. Finally, we report how often AutoML tools are used together in the same\nsource code files. We hope our results can help ML practitioners learn about\ndifferent AutoML tools and their usages, so that they can pick the right tool\nfor their purposes.

    "abstract": "Due to the difficulty in collecting paired real-world training data, image\nderaining is currently dominated by supervised learning with synthesized data\ngenerated by e.g., Photoshop rendering. However, the generalization to real\nrainy scenes is usually limited due to the gap between synthetic and real-world\ndata. In this paper, we first statistically explore why the supervised\nderaining models cannot generalize well to real rainy cases, and find the\nsubstantial difference of synthetic and real rainy data. Inspired by our\nstudies, we propose to remove rain by learning favorable deraining\nrepresentations from other connected tasks. In connected tasks, the label for\nreal data can be easily obtained. Hence, our core idea is to learn\nrepresentations from real data through task transfer to improve deraining\ngeneralization. We thus term our learning strategy as \\textit{task transfer\nlearning}. If there are more than one connected tasks, we propose to reduce\nmodel size by knowledge distillation. The pretrained models for the connected\ntasks are treated as teachers, all their knowledge is distilled to a student\nnetwork, so that we reduce the model size, meanwhile preserve effective prior\nrepresentations from all the connected tasks. At last, the student network is\nfine-tuned with minority of paired synthetic rainy data to guide the pretrained\nprior representations to remove rain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nproposed task transfer learning strategy is surprisingly successful and\ncompares favorably with state-of-the-art supervised learning methods and\napparently surpass other semi-supervised deraining methods on synthetic data.\nParticularly, it shows superior generalization over them to real-world scenes.",

This often leads to coding inefficiency as\nfixed-sized blocks hardly align with the object boundaries. Although\nhierarchical block-partitioning has been introduced to address this, the\nincreased number of motion vectors limits the benefit. Recently, approximate\nsegmentation of images with cuboidal partitioning has gained popularity. Not\nonly are the variable-sized rectangular segments (cuboids) readily amenable to\nblock-based image/video coding techniques, but they are also capable of\naligning well with the object boundaries. This is because cuboidal partitioning\nis based on a homogeneity constraint, minimising the sum of squared errors\n(SSE). In this paper, we have investigated the potential of cuboids in motion\nmodelling against the fixed-sized blocks used in scalable video coding.\nSpecifically, we have constructed motion-compensated current frame using the\ncuboidal partitioning information of the anchor frame in a group-of-picture\n(GOP). The predicted current frame has then been used as the base layer while\nencoding the current frame as an enhancement layer using the scalable HEVC\nencoder.

To this end, we present Principal\nSub-Model (PriSM) training methodology, which leverages models low-rank\nstructure and kernel orthogonality to train sub-models in the orthogonal kernel\nspace. More specifically, by applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to\noriginal kernels in the server model, PriSM first obtains a set of principal\northogonal kernels in which each one is weighed by its singular value.\nThereafter, PriSM utilizes our novel sampling strategy that selects different\nsubsets of the principal kernels independently to create sub-models for\nclients. Importantly, a kernel with a large singular value is assigned with a\nhigh sampling probability. Thus, each sub-model is a low-rank approximation of\nthe full large model, and all clients together achieve the near full-model\ntraining.

Specifically, PC-ASGD\nhas two steps - the $\\textit{predicting step}$ leverages the gradient\nprediction using Taylor expansion to reduce the staleness of the outdated\nweights while the $\\textit{clipping step}$ selectively drops the outdated\nweights to alleviate their negative effects. A tradeoff parameter is introduced\nto balance the effects between these two steps. Theoretically, we present the\nconvergence rate considering the effects of delay of the proposed algorithm\nwith constant step size when the smooth objective functions are weakly\nstrongly-convex and nonconvex. One practical variant of PC-ASGD is also\nproposed by adopting a condition to help with the determination of the tradeoff\nparameter. For empirical validation, we demonstrate the performance of the\nalgorithm with two deep neural network architectures on two benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "As a core part of autonomous driving systems, motion planning has received\nextensive attention from academia and industry. However, there is no efficient\ntrajectory planning solution capable of spatial-temporal joint optimization due\nto nonholonomic dynamics, particularly in the presence of unstructured\nenvironments and dynamic obstacles. To bridge the gap, we propose a versatile\nand real-time trajectory optimization method that can generate a high-quality\nfeasible trajectory using a full vehicle model under arbitrary constraints. By\nleveraging the differential flatness property of car-like robots, we use flat\noutputs to analytically formulate all feasibility constraints to simplify the\ntrajectory planning problem. Moreover, obstacle avoidance is achieved with full\ndimensional polygons to generate less conservative trajectories with safety\nguarantees, especially in tightly constrained spaces. We present comprehensive\nbenchmarks with cutting-edge methods, demonstrating the significance of the\nproposed method in terms of efficiency and trajectory quality. Real-world\nexperiments verify the practicality of our algorithm. We will release our codes\nas open-source packages with the purpose for the reference of the research\ncommunity.",

    "abstract": "The understanding of how users in a network update their opinions based on\ntheir neighbours opinions has attracted a great deal of interest in the field\nof network science, and a growing body of literature recognises the\nsignificance of this issue. In this research paper, we propose a new dynamic\nmodel of opinion formation in directed networks. In this model, the opinion of\neach node is updated as the weighted average of its neighbours opinions, where\nthe weights represent social influence. We define a new centrality measure as a\nsocial influence metric based on both influence and conformity. We measure this\nnew approach using two opinion formation models: (i) the Degroot model and (ii)\nour own proposed model. Previously published research studies have not\nconsidered conformity, and have only considered the influence of the nodes when\ncomputing the social influence. In our definition, nodes with low in-degree and\nhigh out-degree that were connected to nodes with high out-degree and low\nin-degree had higher centrality. As the main contribution of this research, we\npropose an algorithm for finding a small subset of nodes in a social network\nthat can have a significant impact on the opinions of other nodes. Experiments\non real-world data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly\noutperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Without deploying face anti-spoofing countermeasures, face recognition\nsystems can be spoofed by presenting a printed photo, a video, or a silicon\nmask of a genuine user. Thus, face presentation attack detection (PAD) plays a\nvital role in providing secure facial access to digital devices. Most existing\nvideo-based PAD countermeasures lack the ability to cope with long-range\ntemporal variations in videos. Moreover, the key-frame sampling prior to the\nfeature extraction step has not been widely studied in the face anti-spoofing\ndomain. To mitigate these issues, this paper provides a data sampling approach\nby proposing a video processing scheme that models the long-range temporal\nvariations based on Gaussian Weighting Function. Specifically, the proposed\nscheme encodes the consecutive t frames of video sequences into a single RGB\nimage based on a Gaussian-weighted summation of the t frames. Using simply the\ndata sampling scheme alone, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art performance\ncan be achieved without any bells and whistles in both intra-database and\ninter-database testing scenarios for the three public benchmark datasets;\nnamely, Replay-Attack, MSU-MFSD, and CASIA-FASD. In particular, the proposed\nscheme provides a much lower error (from 15.2% to 6.7% on CASIA-FASD and 5.9%\nto 4.9% on Replay-Attack) compared to baselines in cross-database scenarios.",

    "abstract": "A social network (SN) is a social structure consisting of a group\nrepresenting the interaction between them. SNs have recently been widely used\nand, subsequently, have become suitable and popular platforms for product\npromotion and information diffusion. People in an SN directly influence each\nother's interests and behavior. One of the most important problems in SNs is to\nfind people who can have the maximum influence on other nodes in the network in\na cascade manner if they are chosen as the seed nodes of a network diffusion\nscenario. Influential diffusers are people who, if they are chosen as the seed\nset in a publishing issue in the network, that network will have the most\npeople who have learned about that diffused entity. This is a well-known\nproblem in literature known as influence maximization (IM) problem. Although it\nhas been proven that this is an NP-complete problem and does not have a\nsolution in polynomial time, it has been argued that it has the properties of\nsub modular functions and, therefore, can be solved using a greedy algorithm.\nMost of the methods proposed to improve this complexity are based on the\nassumption that the entire graph is visible. However, this assumption does not\nhold for many real-world graphs. This study is conducted to extend current\nmaximization methods with link prediction techniques to pseudo-visibility\ngraphs. To this end, a graph generation method called the exponential random\ngraph model (ERGM) is used for link prediction.

Anomaly detection is an integral part of improving the\navailability as it eases the system administrator's burden and reduces the time\nbetween an anomaly and its resolution.

In recent years, deep learning-based approaches have\nachieved promising success on video deblurring task. However, the models\ntrained on existing synthetic datasets still suffer from generalization\nproblems over real-world blurry scenarios with undesired artifacts. The factors\naccounting for the failure remain unknown. Therefore, we revisit the classical\nblur synthesis pipeline and figure out the possible reasons, including shooting\nparameters, blur formation space, and image signal processor~(ISP). To analyze\nthe effects of these potential factors, we first collect an ultra-high\nframe-rate (940 FPS) RAW video dataset as the data basis to synthesize various\nkinds of blurs. Then we propose a novel realistic blur synthesis pipeline\ntermed as RAW-Blur by leveraging blur formation cues. Through numerous\nexperiments, we demonstrate that synthesizing blurs in the RAW space and\nadopting the same ISP as the real-world testing data can effectively eliminate\nthe negative effects of synthetic data. Furthermore, the shooting parameters of\nthe synthesized blurry video, e.g., exposure time and frame-rate play\nsignificant roles in improving the performance of deblurring models.\nImpressively, the models trained on the blurry data synthesized by the proposed\nRAW-Blur pipeline can obtain more than 5dB PSNR gain against those trained on\nthe existing synthetic blur datasets. We believe the novel realistic synthesis\npipeline and the corresponding RAW video dataset can help the community to\neasily construct customized blur datasets to improve real-world video\ndeblurring performance largely, instead of laboriously collecting real data\npairs.",

    "abstract": "Affordance grounding aims to locate objects' \"action possibilities\" regions,\nwhich is an essential step toward embodied intelligence. Due to the diversity\nof interactive affordance, the uniqueness of different individuals leads to\ndiverse interactions, which makes it difficult to establish an explicit link\nbetween object parts and affordance labels. Human has the ability that\ntransforms the various exocentric interactions into invariant egocentric\naffordance to counter the impact of interactive diversity. To empower an agent\nwith such ability, this paper proposes a task of affordance grounding from\nexocentric view, i.e., given exocentric human-object interaction and egocentric\nobject images, learning the affordance knowledge of the object and transferring\nit to the egocentric image using only the affordance label as supervision.\nHowever, there is some \"interaction bias\" between personas, mainly regarding\ndifferent regions and different views. To this end, we devise a cross-view\naffordance knowledge transfer framework that extracts affordance-specific\nfeatures from exocentric interactions and transfers them to the egocentric\nview. Specifically, the perception of affordance regions is enhanced by\npreserving affordance co-relations. In addition, an affordance grounding\ndataset named AGD20K is constructed by collecting and labeling over 20K images\nfrom $36$ affordance categories.

    "abstract": "Enumerating maximal $k$-biplexes (MBPs) of a bipartite graph has been used\nfor applications such as fraud detection. Nevertheless, there usually exists an\nexponential number of MBPs, which brings up two issues when enumerating MBPs,\nnamely the effectiveness issue (many MBPs are of low values) and the efficiency\nissue (enumerating all MBPs is not affordable on large graphs). Existing\nproposals of tackling this problem impose constraints on the number of vertices\nof each MBP to be enumerated, yet they are still not sufficient (e.g., they\nrequire to specify the constraints, which is often not user-friendly, and\ncannot control the number of MBPs to be enumerated directly). Therefore, in\nthis paper, we study the problem of finding $K$ MBPs with the most edges called\nMaxBPs, where $K$ is a positive integral user parameter. The new proposal well\navoids the drawbacks of existing proposals. We formally prove the NP-hardness\nof the problem. We then design two branch-and-bound algorithms, among which,\nthe better one called FastBB improves the worst-case time complexity to\n$O^*(\\gamma_k^ n)$, where $O^*$ suppresses the polynomials, $\\gamma_k$ is a\nreal number that relies on $k$ and is strictly smaller than 2, and $n$ is the\nnumber of vertices in the graph. For example, for $k=1$, $\\gamma_k$ is equal to\n$1.754$. We further introduce three techniques for boosting the performance of\nthe branch-and-bound algorithms, among which, the best one called PBIE can\nfurther improve the time complexity to $O^*(\\gamma_k^{d^3})$ for large sparse\ngraphs, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the graph. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on both real and synthetic datasets, and the results show that our\nalgorithm is up to four orders of magnitude faster than all baselines and\nfinding MaxBPs works better than finding all MBPs for a fraud detection\napplication.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel approach for relocalization or place recognition, a\nfundamental problem to be solved in many robotics, automation, and AR\napplications. Rather than relying on often unstable appearance information, we\nconsider a situation in which the reference map is given in the form of\nlocalized objects. Our localization framework relies on 3D semantic object\ndetections, which are then associated to objects in the map. Possible pair-wise\nassociation sets are grown based on hierarchical clustering using a merge\nmetric that evaluates spatial compatibility. The latter notably uses\ninformation about relative object configurations, which is invariant with\nrespect to global transformations. Association sets are furthermore updated and\nexpanded as the camera incrementally explores the environment and detects\nfurther objects. We test our algorithm in several challenging situations\nincluding dynamic scenes, large view-point changes, and scenes with repeated\ninstances. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior art\nin terms of both robustness and accuracy.",

    "abstract": "As the modern vehicle becomes more software-defined, it is beginning to take\nsignificant effort to avoid serious regression in software design. This is\nbecause automotive software architects rely largely upon manual review of code\nto spot deviations from specified design principles. Such an approach is both\ninefficient and prone to error. In recent days, neural language models\npre-trained on source code are beginning to be used for automating a variety of\nprogramming tasks. In this work, we extend the application of such a\nProgramming Language Model (PLM) to automate the assessment of design\ncompliance. Using a PLM, we construct a system that assesses whether a set of\nquery programs comply with Controller-Handler, a design pattern specified to\nensure hardware abstraction in automotive control software. The assessment is\nbased upon measuring whether the geometrical arrangement of query program\nembeddings, extracted from the PLM, aligns with that of a set of known\nimplementations of the pattern. The level of alignment is then transformed into\nan interpretable measure of compliance. Using a controlled experiment, we\ndemonstrate that our technique determines compliance with a precision of 92%.\nAlso, using expert review to calibrate the automated assessment, we introduce a\nprotocol to determine the nature of the violation, helping eventual\nrefactoring. Results from this work indicate that neural language models can\nprovide valuable assistance to human architects in assessing and fixing\nviolations in automotive software design.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing geometric properties of high-dimensional loss functions, such as\nlocal curvature and the existence of other optima around a certain point in\nloss space, can help provide a better understanding of the interplay between\nneural network structure, implementation attributes, and learning performance.\nIn this work, we combine concepts from high-dimensional probability and\ndifferential geometry to study how curvature properties in lower-dimensional\nloss representations depend on those in the original loss space. We show that\nsaddle points in the original space are rarely correctly identified as such in\nlower-dimensional representations if random projections are used. In such\nprojections, the expected curvature in a lower-dimensional representation is\nproportional to the mean curvature in the original loss space. Hence, the mean\ncurvature in the original loss space determines if saddle points appear, on\naverage, as either minima, maxima, or almost flat regions. We use the\nconnection between expected curvature and mean curvature (i.e., the normalized\nHessian trace) to estimate the trace of Hessians without calculating the\nHessian or Hessian-vector products as in Hutchinson's method. Because random\nprojections are not able to correctly identify saddle information, we propose\nto study projections along Hessian directions that are associated with the\nlargest and smallest principal curvatures. We connect our findings to the\nongoing debate on loss landscape flatness and generalizability.

    "abstract": "Network structure plays a critical role in functionality and performance of\nnetwork systems. This paper examines structural adaptivity of diffusively\ncoupled, directed multi-agent networks that are subject to diffusion\nperformance. Inspired by the observation that the link redundancy in a network\nmay degrade its diffusion performance, a distributed data-driven neighbor\nselection framework is proposed to adaptively adjust the network structure for\nimproving the diffusion performance of exogenous influence over the network.\nSpecifically, each agent is allowed to interact with only a specific subset of\nneighbors while global reachability from exogenous influence to all agents of\nthe network is maintained. Both continuous-time and discrete-time directed\nnetworks are examined. For each of the two cases, we first examine the\nreachability properties encoded in the eigenvectors of perturbed variants of\ngraph Laplacian or SIA matrix associated with directed networks, respectively.\nThen, an eigenvector-based rule for neighbor selection is proposed to derive a\nreduced network, on which the diffusion performance is enhanced. Finally,\nmotivated by the necessity of distributed and data-driven implementation of the\nneighbor selection rule, quantitative connections between eigenvectors of the\nperturbed graph Laplacian and SIA matrix and relative rate of change in agent\nstate are established, respectively. These connections immediately enable a\ndata-driven inference of the reduced neighbor set for each agent using only\nlocally accessible data. As an immediate extension, we further discuss the\ndistributed data-driven construction of directed spanning trees of directed\nnetworks using the proposed neighbor selection framework.

In\nparticular self-healing systems, which aim to provide resilience and\nfault-tolerance, often deal with unanticipated failures in critical and highly\ndynamic environments. Their reactive and complex behavior makes it challenging\nto assess if these systems execute according to the desired goals. Recently,\nseveral studies have expressed concern about the lack of systematic evaluation\nmethods for self-healing behavior.\nIn this paper, we propose CHESS, an approach for the systematic evaluation of\nself-adaptive and self-healing systems that builds on chaos engineering. Chaos\nengineering is a methodology for subjecting a system to unexpected conditions\nand scenarios. It has shown great promise in helping developers build resilient\nmicroservice architectures and cyber-physical systems. CHESS turns this idea\naround by using chaos engineering to evaluate how well a self-healing system\ncan withstand such perturbations. We investigate the viability of this approach\nthrough an exploratory study on a self-healing smart office environment.

Thus each city\nis summarized by three traits: minority percent, a measure of segregation, and\navailability of a fair district plan. We find that when the minority population\nis around 25%-33%, there is a positive correlation between the degree of\nsegregation and the availability of proportional district plan. Consistently,\nwhen the minority population lives in a more diffuse residential pattern, there\nare fewer available proportional district plans.

In this\nproblem, a user wants to privately retrieve $D$ messages out of $K$ messages\nwhose identical copies are stored on $N$ remote servers, while maximizing the\ndownload rate. The MPIR schemes can find applications in many practical\nscenarios and can serve as an important building block for private computation\nand private machine learning applications. The existing solutions for MPIR\nrequire a large degree of subpacketization, which can result in large\noverheads, high complexity, and impose constraints on the system parameters.\nThese factors can limit practical applications of the existing solutions. In\nthis paper, we present a methodology for the design of scalar-linear MPIR\nschemes. Such schemes are easy to implement in practical systems as they do not\nrequire partitioning of messages into smaller size sub-messages and do not\nimpose any constraints on the minimum required size of the messages. Focusing\non the case of $N=D+1$, we show that when $D$ divides $K$, our scheme achieves\nthe capacity, where the capacity is defined as the maximum achievable download\nrate.

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress made in the past few years, challenges remain\nfor depth estimation using a single monocular image. First, it is nontrivial to\ntrain a metric-depth prediction model that can generalize well to diverse\nscenes mainly due to limited training data. Thus, researchers have built\nlarge-scale relative depth datasets that are much easier to collect. However,\nexisting relative depth estimation models often fail to recover accurate 3D\nscene shapes due to the unknown depth shift caused by training with the\nrelative depth data. We tackle this problem here and attempt to estimate\naccurate scene shapes by training on large-scale relative depth data, and\nestimating the depth shift. To do so, we propose a two-stage framework that\nfirst predicts depth up to an unknown scale and shift from a single monocular\nimage, and then exploits 3D point cloud data to predict the depth shift and the\ncamera's focal length that allow us to recover 3D scene shapes. As the two\nmodules are trained separately, we do not need strictly paired training data.\nIn addition, we propose an image-level normalized regression loss and a\nnormal-based geometry loss to improve training with relative depth annotation.\nWe test our depth model on nine unseen datasets and achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on zero-shot evaluation.

    "abstract": "Program slicing reduces a program to a smaller version that retains a chosen\ncomputation, referred to as a slicing criterion. One recent multi-lingual\nslicing approach, observation-based slicing (ORBS), speculatively deletes parts\nof the program and then executes the code. If the behavior of the slicing\ncriteria is unchanged, the speculative deletion is made permanent.\nWhile this makes ORBS language agnostic, it can lead to the production of\nsome non-intuitive slices. One particular challenge is when the execution\nenvironment plays a role. For example, ORBS will delete the line \"a = 0\" if the\nmemory location assigned to a contains zero before executing the statement,\nsince deletion will not affect the value of a and thus the slicing criterion.\nConsequently, slices can differ between execution environments due to factors\nsuch as initialization and call stack reuse.\nThe technique considered, nVORBS, attempts to ameliorate this problem by\nvalidating a candidate slice in n different execution environments. We conduct\nan empirical study to collect initial insights into how often the execution\nenvironment leads to slice differences. Specifically, we compare and contrast\nthe slices produced by seven different instantiations of nVORBS.

    "abstract": "Learning heterogeneous graphs consisting of different types of nodes and\nedges enhances the results of homogeneous graph techniques. An interesting\nexample of such graphs is control-flow graphs representing possible software\ncode execution flows. As such graphs represent more semantic information of\ncode, developing techniques and tools for such graphs can be highly beneficial\nfor detecting vulnerabilities in software for its reliability. However,\nexisting heterogeneous graph techniques are still insufficient in handling\ncomplex graphs where the number of different types of nodes and edges is large\nand variable. This paper concentrates on the Ethereum smart contracts as a\nsample of software codes represented by heterogeneous contract graphs built\nupon both control-flow graphs and call graphs containing different types of\nnodes and links. We propose MANDO, a new heterogeneous graph representation to\nlearn such heterogeneous contract graphs' structures. MANDO extracts customized\nmetapaths, which compose relational connections between different types of\nnodes and their neighbors. Moreover, it develops a multi-metapath heterogeneous\ngraph attention network to learn multi-level embeddings of different types of\nnodes and their metapaths in the heterogeneous contract graphs, which can\ncapture the code semantics of smart contracts more accurately and facilitate\nboth fine-grained line-level and coarse-grained contract-level vulnerability\ndetection. Our extensive evaluation of large smart contract datasets shows that\nMANDO improves the vulnerability detection results of other techniques at the\ncoarse-grained contract level.

    "title": "Bayesian Neural Network Language Modeling for Speech Recognition",
    "abstract": "State-of-the-art neural network language models (NNLMs) represented by long\nshort term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNNs) and Transformers are\nbecoming highly complex. They are prone to overfitting and poor generalization\nwhen given limited training data. To this end, an overarching full Bayesian\nlearning framework encompassing three methods is proposed in this paper to\naccount for the underlying uncertainty in LSTM-RNN and Transformer LMs. The\nuncertainty over their model parameters, choice of neural activations and\nhidden output representations are modeled using Bayesian, Gaussian Process and\nvariational LSTM-RNN or Transformer LMs respectively. Efficient inference\napproaches were used to automatically select the optimal network internal\ncomponents to be Bayesian learned using neural architecture search. A minimal\nnumber of Monte Carlo parameter samples as low as one was also used. These\nallow the computational costs incurred in Bayesian NNLM training and evaluation\nto be minimized. Experiments are conducted on two tasks: AMI meeting\ntranscription and Oxford-BBC LipReading Sentences 2 (LRS2) overlapped speech\nrecognition using state-of-the-art LF-MMI trained factored TDNN systems\nfeaturing data augmentation, speaker adaptation and audio-visual multi-channel\nbeamforming for overlapped speech. Consistent performance improvements over the\nbaseline LSTM-RNN and Transformer LMs with point estimated model parameters and\ndrop-out regularization were obtained across both tasks in terms of perplexity\nand word error rate (WER). In particular, on the LRS2 data, statistically\nsignificant WER reductions up to 1.3% and 1.2% absolute (12.1% and 11.3%\nrelative) were obtained over the baseline LSTM-RNN and Transformer LMs\nrespectively after model combination between Bayesian NNLMs and their\nrespective baselines.",

    "abstract": "Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is a concept which is gaining a big\npopularity in multiuser networks. It's due to its advantages in sense of total\nnetwork throughput. It becomes especially significant in large networks such as\nInternet of Things (IoT) networks or 5G networks. One of the known NOMA\ntechniques is DS-CDMA NOMA, which make use of non-orthogonal coding schemes to\noptimize capacity at multiuser networks. Equiangular Tight Frames (ETF) are\nknown to be an optimal sequences' sets (in sense of capacity) for this\ntechnique. Unfortunately, ETFs are limited to very specific pairs of users'\nnumber and sequence lengths which put undesirable constraints on practical\nsystems. In this paper our goal is to break those constraints by proposing\nalternative family of non-orthogonal sequences which on the one hand, possess\nsimilar properties to those of ETFs (for that reason we'll denote them as\nAlmost ETFs) and on the other hand, doesn't have those limitation on users'\nnumber and sequence length. We're basing our approach by starting with known\ntechnique of building standard ETFs, and extending it by slight modifications\nto technique of building AETFs. In this paper we'll concentrate on bipolar\n(+/-1 valued) and relatively short (up to length of 100) sequences, since we're\ninterested in sequences which will be of practical value in real systems.",

Existing datasets with annotation for summary assessment are usually\nbased on news summarization datasets such as CNN/DailyMail or XSum. In this\nwork, we describe a new dataset, the podcast summary assessment corpus, a\ncollection of podcast summaries that were evaluated by human experts at\nTREC2020. Compared to existing summary assessment data, this dataset has two\nunique aspects: (i) long-input, speech podcast based, documents; and (ii) an\nopportunity to detect inappropriate reference summaries in podcast corpus.\nFirst, we examine existing assessment methods, including model-free and\nmodel-based methods, and provide benchmark results for this long-input summary\nassessment dataset.

    "abstract": "Building a conversational embodied agent to execute real-life tasks has been\na long-standing yet quite challenging research goal, as it requires effective\nhuman-agent communication, multi-modal understanding, long-range sequential\ndecision making, etc. Traditional symbolic methods have scaling and\ngeneralization issues, while end-to-end deep learning models suffer from data\nscarcity and high task complexity, and are often hard to explain. To benefit\nfrom both worlds, we propose a Neuro-Symbolic Commonsense Reasoning (JARVIS)\nframework for modular, generalizable, and interpretable conversational embodied\nagents. First, it acquires symbolic representations by prompting large language\nmodels (LLMs) for language understanding and sub-goal planning, and by\nconstructing semantic maps from visual observations. Then the symbolic module\nreasons for sub-goal planning and action generation based on task- and\naction-level common sense. Extensive experiments on the TEACh dataset validate\nthe efficacy and efficiency of our JARVIS framework, which achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) results on all three dialog-based embodied tasks,\nincluding Execution from Dialog History (EDH), Trajectory from Dialog (TfD),\nand Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC) (e.g., our method boosts the unseen\nSuccess Rate on EDH from 6.1\\% to 15.8\\%). Moreover, we systematically analyze\nthe essential factors that affect the task performance and also demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method in few-shot settings.

While there have been\nintensive studies through past decades on classical methods such as Jacobi,\nGauss-Seidel, conjugate gradient, multigrid methods and their more advanced\nvariants, there is still a pressing need to develop faster, more robust and\nreliable solvers. Based on recent advances in scientific deep learning for\noperator regression, we propose HINTS, a hybrid, iterative, numerical, and\ntransferable solver for differential equations. HINTS combines standard\nrelaxation methods and the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet). Compared to\nstandard numerical solvers, HINTS is capable of providing faster solutions for\na wide class of differential equations, while preserving the accuracy close to\nmachine zero. Through an eigenmode analysis, we find that the individual\nsolvers in HINTS target distinct regions in the spectrum of eigenmodes,\nresulting in a uniform convergence rate and hence exceptional performance of\nthe hybrid solver overall. Moreover, HINTS applies to equations in\nmultidimensions, and is flexible with regards to computational domain and\ntransferable to different discretizations.",

Malware infections are increasing in\ncomplexity and unfold over a number of stages. A malicious downloader often\nacts as the starting point as it fingerprints the victim's machine and\ndownloads one or more additional malware payloads. Although previous research\nwas conducted on these malicious downloaders and their Pay-Per-Install\nnetworks, limited work has investigated how the profile of the victim machine,\ne.g., its characteristics and software configuration, affect the targeting\nchoice of cybercriminals.\nIn this paper, we operate a large-scale investigation of the relation between\nthe machine profile and the payload downloaded by droppers, through 151,189\nexecutions of malware downloaders over a period of 12 months. We build a fully\nautomated framework which uses Virtual Machines (VMs) in sandboxes to build\ncustom user and machine profiles to test our malicious samples. We then use\nchangepoint analysis to model the behavior of different downloader families,\nand perform analyses of variance (ANOVA) on the ratio of infections per\nprofile. With this, we identify which machine profile is targeted by\ncybercriminals at different points in time.\nOur results show that a number of downloaders present different behaviors\ndepending on a number of features of a machine. Notably, a higher number of\ninfections for specific malware families were observed when using different\nbrowser profiles, keyboard layouts and operating systems, while one keyboard\nlayout obtained fewer infections of a specific malware family.\nOur findings bring light to the importance of the features of a machine\nrunning malicious downloader software, particularly for malware research.",

The task is to find such a common representation of both source and\ntarget datasets in which the source dataset is informative for training and\nsuch that the divergence between source and target would be minimized. Most\npopular solutions for domain adaptation are currently based on training neural\nnetworks that combine classification and adversarial learning modules, which\nare data hungry and usually difficult to train. We present a method called\nDomain Adaptation Principal Component Analysis (DAPCA) which finds a linear\nreduced data representation useful for solving the domain adaptation task.\nDAPCA is based on introducing positive and negative weights between pairs of\ndata points and generalizes the supervised extension of principal component\nanalysis.

The convergence of the\nalgorithm is guaranteed and the number of iterations is small in practice. We\nvalidate the suggested algorithm on previously proposed benchmarks for solving\nthe domain adaptation task, and also show the benefit of using DAPCA in the\nanalysis of single cell omics datasets in biomedical applications.

    "abstract": "Many applications of reinforcement learning can be formalized as\ngoal-conditioned environments, where, in each episode, there is a \"goal\" that\naffects the rewards obtained during that episode but does not affect the\ndynamics. Various techniques have been proposed to improve performance in\ngoal-conditioned environments, such as automatic curriculum generation and goal\nrelabeling. In this work, we explore a connection between off-policy\nreinforcement learning in goal-conditioned settings and knowledge distillation.\nIn particular: the current Q-value function and the target Q-value estimate are\nboth functions of the goal, and we would like to train the Q-value function to\nmatch its target for all goals. We therefore apply Gradient-Based Attention\nTransfer (Zagoruyko and Komodakis 2017), a knowledge distillation technique, to\nthe Q-function update. We empirically show that this can improve the\nperformance of goal-conditioned off-policy reinforcement learning when the\nspace of goals is high-dimensional. We also show that this technique can be\nadapted to allow for efficient learning in the case of multiple simultaneous\nsparse goals, where the agent can attain a reward by achieving any one of a\nlarge set of objectives, all specified at test time. Finally, to provide\ntheoretical support, we give examples of classes of environments where (under\nsome assumptions) standard off-policy algorithms require at least O(d^2)\nobserved transitions to learn an optimal policy, while our proposed technique\nrequires only O(d) transitions, where d is the dimensionality of the goal and\nstate space.",

    "title": "Predicting IMDb Rating of TV Series with Deep Learning: The Case of  Arrow",
    "abstract": "Context: The number of TV series offered nowadays is very high. Due to its\nlarge amount, many series are canceled due to a lack of originality that\ngenerates a low audience.\nProblem: Having a decision support system that can show why some shows are a\nhuge success or not would facilitate the choices of renewing or starting a\nshow.\nSolution: We studied the case of the series Arrow broadcasted by CW Network\nand used descriptive and predictive modeling techniques to predict the IMDb\nrating. We assumed that the theme of the episode would affect its evaluation by\nusers, so the dataset is composed only by the director of the episode, the\nnumber of reviews that episode got, the percentual of each theme extracted by\nthe Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model of an episode, the number of\nviewers from Wikipedia and the rating from IMDb. The LDA model is a generative\nprobabilistic model of a collection of documents made up of words.\nMethod: In this prescriptive research, the case study method was used, and\nits results were analyzed using a quantitative approach.\nSummary of Results: With the features of each episode, the model that\nperformed the best to predict the rating was Catboost due to a similar mean\nsquared error of the KNN model but a better standard deviation during the test\nphase. It was possible to predict IMDb ratings with an acceptable root mean\nsquared error of 0.55.",

    "abstract": "Activation functions are essential for neural networks to introduce\nnon-linearity. A great number of empirical experiments have validated various\nactivation functions, yet theoretical research on activation functions are\ninsufficient. In this work, we study the impact of activation functions on the\nvariance of gradients and propose an approach to normalize activation functions\nto keep the variance of the gradient same for all layers so that the neural\nnetwork can achieve better convergence. First, we complement the previous work\non the analysis of the variance of gradients where the impact of activation\nfunctions are just considered in an idealized initial state which almost cannot\nbe preserved during training and obtained a property that good activation\nfunctions should satisfy as possible. Second, we offer an approach to normalize\nactivation functions and testify its effectiveness on prevalent activation\nfunctions empirically. And by observing experiments, we discover that the speed\nof convergence is roughly related to the property we derived in the former\npart. We run experiments of our normalized activation functions against common\nactivation functions. And the result shows our approach consistently\noutperforms their unnormalized counterparts. For example, normalized Swish\noutperforms vanilla Swish by 1.2% on ResNet50 with CIFAR-100 in terms of top-1\naccuracy. Our method improves the performance by simply replacing activation\nfunctions with their normalized ones in both fully-connected networks and\nresidual networks.",

    "abstract": "While a streaming voice assistant system has been used in many applications,\nthis system typically focuses on unnatural, one-shot interactions assuming\ninput from a single voice query without hesitation or disfluency. However, a\ncommon conversational utterance often involves multiple queries with\nturn-taking, in addition to disfluencies. These disfluencies include pausing to\nthink, hesitations, word lengthening, filled pauses and repeated phrases. This\nmakes doing speech recognition with conversational speech, including one with\nmultiple queries, a challenging task. To better model the conversational\ninteraction, it is critical to discriminate disfluencies and end of query in\norder to allow the user to hold the floor for disfluencies while having the\nsystem respond as quickly as possible when the user has finished speaking. In\nthis paper, we present a turntaking predictor built on top of the end-to-end\n(E2E) speech recognizer. Our best system is obtained by jointly optimizing for\nASR task and detecting when the user is paused to think or finished speaking.\nThe proposed approach demonstrates over 97% recall rate and 85% precision rate\non predicting true turn-taking with only 100 ms latency on a test set designed\nwith 4 types of disfluencies inserted in conversational utterances.",

Recent years have\nwitnessed the technical development of recommender systems, from perception\nlearning to cognition reasoning which intuitively build the task of\nrecommendation as the procedure of logical reasoning and have achieve\nsignificant improvement. However, the logical statement in reasoning implicitly\nadmits irrelevance of ordering, even does not consider time information which\nplays an important role in many recommendation tasks. Furthermore,\nrecommendation model incorporated with temporal context would tend to be\nself-attentive, i.e., automatically focus more (less) on the relevance\n(irrelevance), respectively.\nTo address these issues, in this paper, we propose a Time-aware\nSelf-Attention with Neural Collaborative Reasoning (TiSANCR) based\nrecommendation model, which integrates temporal patterns and self-attention\nmechanism into reasoning-based recommendation. Specially, temporal patterns\nrepresented by relative time, provide context and auxiliary information to\ncharacterize the user's preference in recommendation, while self-attention is\nleveraged to distill informative patterns and suppress irrelevances. Therefore,\nthe fusion of self-attentive temporal information provides deeper\nrepresentation of user's preference.

    "title": "Billion-user Customer Lifetime Value Prediction: An Industrial-scale  Solution from Kuaishou",
    "abstract": "Customer Life Time Value (LTV) is the expected total revenue that a single\nuser can bring to a business. It is widely used in a variety of business\nscenarios to make operational decisions when acquiring new customers. Modeling\nLTV is a challenging problem, due to its complex and mutable data distribution.\nExisting approaches either directly learn from posterior feature distributions\nor leverage statistical models that make strong assumption on prior\ndistributions, both of which fail to capture those mutable distributions. In\nthis paper, we propose a complete set of industrial-level LTV modeling\nsolutions. Specifically, we introduce an Order Dependency Monotonic Network\n(ODMN) that models the ordered dependencies between LTVs of different time\nspans, which greatly improves model performance. We further introduce a Multi\nDistribution Multi Experts (MDME) module based on the Divide-and-Conquer idea,\nwhich transforms the severely imbalanced distribution modeling problem into a\nseries of relatively balanced sub-distribution modeling problems hence greatly\nreduces the modeling complexity. In addition, a novel evaluation metric Mutual\nGini is introduced to better measure the distribution difference between the\nestimated value and the ground-truth label based on the Lorenz Curve. The ODMN\nframework has been successfully deployed in many business scenarios of\nKuaishou, and achieved great performance. Extensive experiments on real-world\nindustrial data demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines including ZILN and Two-Stage XGBoost models.",

    "abstract": "The recent privacy leakage incidences and the more strict policy regulations\ndemand a much higher standard of compliance for companies and mobile apps.\nHowever, such obligations also impose significant challenges on app developers\nfor complying with these regulations that contain various perspectives,\nactivities, and roles, especially for small companies and developers who are\nless experienced in this matter or with limited resources. To address these\nhurdles, we develop an automatic tool, NL2GDPR, which can generate policies\nfrom natural language descriptions from the developer while also ensuring the\napp's functionalities are compliant with General Data Protection Regulation\n(GDPR). NL2GDPR is developed by leveraging an information extraction tool, OIA\n(Open Information Annotation), developed by Baidu Cognitive Computing Lab.\nAt the core, NL2GDPR is a privacy-centric information extraction model,\nappended with a GDPR policy finder and a policy generator. We perform a\ncomprehensive study to grasp the challenges in extracting privacy-centric\ninformation and generating privacy policies, while exploiting optimizations for\nthis specific task. With NL2GDPR, we can achieve 92.9%, 95.2%, and 98.4%\naccuracy in correctly identifying GDPR policies related to personal data\nstorage, process, and share types, respectively. To the best of our knowledge,\nNL2GDPR is the first tool that allows a developer to automatically generate\nGDPR compliant policies, with only the need of entering the natural language\nfor describing the app features.

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, there has been an increased interest in using FPGAs\nalongside CPUs and GPUs in high-performance computing systems and data centers.\nThis trend has led to a push toward the use of high-level programming models\nand libraries, such as OpenCL, both to lower the barriers to the adoption of\nFPGAs by programmers unfamiliar with hardware description languages (HDLs), and\nto allow to seamlessly deploy a single code on different devices. Today, both\nIntel and Xilinx (now part of AMD) offer toolchains to compile OpenCL code onto\nFPGA. However, using OpenCL on FPGAs is complicated by performance portability\nissues, since different devices have fundamental differences in architecture\nand nature of hardware parallelism they offer. Hence, platform-specific\noptimizations are crucial to achieving good performance across devices. In this\npaper, we propose using the feed-forward design model based on pipes in order\nto improve the performance of OpenCL codes running on FPGA. We show the code\ntransformations required to apply this method to existing OpenCL kernels, and\nwe discuss the restrictions to its applicability. Using popular benchmark\nsuites and microbenchmarks, we show that the feed-forward design model can\nresult in higher utilization of the global memory bandwidth available and\nincreased instruction concurrency, thus improving the overall throughput of the\nOpenCL implementations at a modest resource utilization cost. Further\nconcurrency can be achieved by using multiple producers and multiple consumers.",

    "abstract": "Imaging exams, such as chest radiography, will yield a small set of common\nfindings and a much larger set of uncommon findings. While a trained\nradiologist can learn the visual presentation of rare conditions by studying a\nfew representative examples, teaching a machine to learn from such a\n\"long-tailed\" distribution is much more difficult, as standard methods would be\neasily biased toward the most frequent classes. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive benchmark study of the long-tailed learning problem in the\nspecific domain of thorax diseases on chest X-rays. We focus on learning from\nnaturally distributed chest X-ray data, optimizing classification accuracy over\nnot only the common \"head\" classes, but also the rare yet critical \"tail\"\nclasses. To accomplish this, we introduce a challenging new long-tailed chest\nX-ray benchmark to facilitate research on developing long-tailed learning\nmethods for medical image classification. The benchmark consists of two chest\nX-ray datasets for 19- and 20-way thorax disease classification, containing\nclasses with as many as 53,000 and as few as 7 labeled training images. We\nevaluate both standard and state-of-the-art long-tailed learning methods on\nthis new benchmark, analyzing which aspects of these methods are most\nbeneficial for long-tailed medical image classification and summarizing\ninsights for future algorithm design.

    "abstract": "Semantically meaningful sentence embeddings are important for numerous tasks\nin natural language processing. To obtain such embeddings, recent studies\nexplored the idea of utilizing synthetically generated data from pretrained\nlanguage models (PLMs) as a training corpus. However, PLMs often generate\nsentences much different from the ones written by human. We hypothesize that\ntreating all these synthetic examples equally for training deep neural networks\ncan have an adverse effect on learning semantically meaningful embeddings. To\nanalyze this, we first train a classifier that identifies machine-written\nsentences, and observe that the linguistic features of the sentences identified\nas written by a machine are significantly different from those of human-written\nsentences. Based on this, we propose a novel approach that first trains the\nclassifier to measure the importance of each sentence. The distilled\ninformation from the classifier is then used to train a reliable sentence\nembedding model. Through extensive evaluation on four real-world datasets, we\ndemonstrate that our model trained on synthetic data generalizes well and\noutperforms the existing baselines.

    "abstract": "After the development of different machine learning and manifold learning\nalgorithms, it may be a good time to put them together to make a powerful mind\nfor machine. In this work, we propose affective manifolds as components of a\nmachine's mind. Every affective manifold models a characteristic group of mind\nand contains multiple states. We define the machine's mind as a set of\naffective manifolds. We use a learning model for mapping the input signals to\nthe embedding space of affective manifold. Using this mapping, a machine or a\nrobot takes an input signal and can react emotionally to it. We use deep metric\nlearning, with Siamese network, and propose a loss function for affective\nmanifold learning. We define margins between states based on the psychological\nand philosophical studies. Using triplets of instances, we train the network to\nminimize the variance of every state and have the desired distances between\nstates. We show that affective manifolds can have various applications for\nmachine-machine and human-machine interactions. Some simulations are also\nprovided for verification of the proposed method. It is possible to have as\nmany affective manifolds as required in machine's mind. More affective\nmanifolds in the machine's mind can make it more realistic and effective.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to outperform traditional machine\nlearning algorithms in a broad variety of application domains due to their\neffectiveness in modeling intricate problems and handling high-dimensional\ndatasets. Many real-life datasets, however, are of increasingly high\ndimensionality, where a large number of features may be irrelevant to the task\nat hand. The inclusion of such features would not only introduce unwanted noise\nbut also increase computational complexity. Furthermore, due to high\nnon-linearity and dependency among a large number of features, DNN models tend\nto be unavoidably opaque and perceived as black-box methods because of their\nnot well-understood internal functioning. A well-interpretable model can\nidentify statistically significant features and explain the way they affect the\nmodel's outcome. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to improve the\ninterpretability of black-box models for classification tasks in the case of\nhigh-dimensional datasets. To this end, we first train a black-box model on a\nhigh-dimensional dataset to learn the embeddings on which the classification is\nperformed. To decompose the inner working principles of the black-box model and\nto identify top-k important features, we employ different probing and\nperturbing techniques. We then approximate the behavior of the black-box model\nby means of an interpretable surrogate model on the top-k feature space.\nFinally, we derive decision rules and local explanations from the surrogate\nmodel to explain individual decisions. Our approach outperforms and competes\nwith state-of-the-art methods such as TabNet, XGboost, and SHAP-based\ninterpretability techniques when tested on different datasets with varying\ndimensionality between 50 and 20,000.",

    "abstract": "Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) have brought new opportunities to improve\ntraffic throughput and reduce energy consumption. However, the uncertain\nlane-change behaviors (LCBs) of surrounding vehicles (SVs) as an uncontrollable\nfactor significantly threaten the driving safety and the consistent movement of\na group of platoon CAVs. How to ensure safe, efficient, and fuel economic\nplatoon control poses a key challenge faced by researchers in complex traffic\nenvironments. This study proposes a dynamic platoon management and cooperative\ndriving framework for a mixed traffic flow consisting of multiple CAVs and\npossible human-driven vehicles (HDVs) as the SVs on unsignalized roads. In the\nproposed framework, the leader CAV of the platoon provides a high-level\nautomatic driving decision to the follower CAVs by developing an optimal\ntrajectory estimation of the HDVs while distributed observers and tracking\ncontrollers are properly implemented by the follower CAVs. Specifically, the\nproposed framework consists of three stages. At the observation stage, the\ncruising information of all the SVs will be collected by the leader CAV through\nthe Cellular-Vehicle-to-X (C-V2X) infrastructure, while an automatic\ndecision-making driving assistance system (ADMDSS) is constructed to determine\nthe driving states of the platoon. When the HDVs approach the communication\nrange of the platoon, in the prediction stage, the trajectories of the HDVs as\nthe target vehicles will be estimated and the reference trajectory planning for\nthe leader CAV and the cooperative controller design for the follower CAVs will\nbe respectively activated by using C-V2X infrastructure. Simulation cases are\npresented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",

    "title": "PV-RCNN++: Semantical Point-Voxel Feature Interaction for 3D Object  Detection",
    "abstract": "Large imbalance often exists between the foreground points (i.e., objects)\nand the background points in outdoor LiDAR point clouds. It hinders\ncutting-edge detectors from focusing on informative areas to produce accurate\n3D object detection results. This paper proposes a novel object detection\nnetwork by semantical point-voxel feature interaction, dubbed PV-RCNN++. Unlike\nmost of existing methods, PV-RCNN++ explores the semantic information to\nenhance the quality of object detection. First, a semantic segmentation module\nis proposed to retain more discriminative foreground keypoints. Such a module\nwill guide our PV-RCNN++ to integrate more object-related point-wise and\nvoxel-wise features in the pivotal areas. Then, to make points and voxels\ninteract efficiently, we utilize voxel query based on Manhattan distance to\nquickly sample voxel-wise features around keypoints. Such the voxel query will\nreduce the time complexity from O(N) to O(K), compared to the ball query.\nFurther, to avoid being stuck in learning only local features, an\nattention-based residual PointNet module is designed to expand the receptive\nfield to adaptively aggregate the neighboring voxel-wise features into\nkeypoints. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset show that PV-RCNN++\nachieves 81.60$\\%$, 40.18$\\%$, 68.21$\\%$ 3D mAP on Car, Pedestrian, and\nCyclist, achieving comparable or even better performance to the\nstate-of-the-arts.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a variable grouping method based on cooperative\ncoevolution for large-scale multi-objective problems (LSMOPs), named Linkage\nMeasurement Minimization (LMM). And for the sub-problem optimization stage, a\nhybrid NSGA-II with a Gaussian sampling operator based on an estimated\nconvergence point is proposed. In the variable grouping stage, according to our\nprevious research, we treat the variable grouping problem as a combinatorial\noptimization problem, and the linkage measurement function is designed based on\nlinkage identification by the nonlinearity check on real code (LINC-R). We\nextend this variable grouping method to LSMOPs. In the sub-problem optimization\nstage, we hypothesize that there is a higher probability of existing better\nsolutions around the Pareto Front (PF). Based on this hypothesis, we estimate a\nconvergence point at every generation of optimization and perform Gaussian\nsampling around the convergence point. The samples with good objective value\nwill participate in the optimization as elites.

    "abstract": "Despite being one of the largest and most popular projects, the official\nAndroid framework has only provided test cases for less than 30% of its APIs.\nSuch a poor test case coverage rate has led to many compatibility issues that\ncan cause apps to crash at runtime on specific Android devices, resulting in\npoor user experiences for both apps and the Android ecosystem. To mitigate this\nimpact, various approaches have been proposed to automatically detect such\ncompatibility issues. Unfortunately, these approaches have only focused on\ndetecting signature-induced compatibility issues (i.e., a certain API does not\nexist in certain Android versions), leaving other equally important types of\ncompatibility issues unresolved. In this work, we propose a novel prototype\ntool, JUnitTestGen, to fill this gap by mining existing Android API usage to\ngenerate unit test cases. After locating Android API usage in given real-world\nAndroid apps, JUnitTestGen performs inter-procedural backward data-flow\nanalysis to generate a minimal executable code snippet (i.e., test case).\nExperimental results on thousands of real-world Android apps show that\nJUnitTestGen is effective in generating valid unit test cases for Android APIs.\nWe show that these generated test cases are indeed helpful for pinpointing\ncompatibility issues, including ones involving semantic code changes.",

    "abstract": "Non-parallel text style transfer is an important task in natural language\ngeneration. However, previous studies concentrate on the token or sentence\nlevel, such as sentence sentiment and formality transfer, but neglect long\nstyle transfer at the discourse level. Long texts usually involve more\ncomplicated author linguistic preferences such as discourse structures than\nsentences. In this paper, we formulate the task of non-parallel story\nauthor-style transfer, which requires transferring an input story into a\nspecified author style while maintaining source semantics. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose a generation model, named StoryTrans, which leverages\ndiscourse representations to capture source content information and transfer\nthem to target styles with learnable style embeddings. We use an additional\ntraining objective to disentangle stylistic features from the learned discourse\nrepresentation to prevent the model from degenerating to an auto-encoder.\nMoreover, to enhance content preservation, we design a mask-and-fill framework\nto explicitly fuse style-specific keywords of source texts into generation.\nFurthermore, we constructed new datasets for this task in Chinese and English,\nrespectively. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms strong\nbaselines in overall performance of style transfer and content preservation.",

    "abstract": "The unknown sharp changes of vehicle acceleration rates, also called the\nunknown jerk dynamics, may significantly affect the driving performance of the\nleader vehicle in a platoon, resulting in more drastic car-following movements\nin platooning tracking control, which could cause safety and traffic capacity\nconcerns. To address these issues, in this paper, we investigate cooperative\nplatooning tracking control and intermittent optimization problems for\nconnected automated vehicles (CAVs) with a nonlinear car-following model. We\nassume that the external inputs of the leader CAV contain unknown but bounded\njerk parameters, and the acceleration signals of the leader CAV are known only\nto a few neighboring follower CAVs in a free-design but directed communication\nnetwork. To solve these problems, a distributed observer law is developed to\nprovide a reference signal expressed as an estimated unknown jerk dynamic of\nthe leader CAV and implemented by each follower CAV. Then, a novel distributed\nplatooning tracking control protocol is proposed to construct the cooperative\ntracking controllers under identical inter-vehicle constraints, which can\nensure a desired safety distance among the CAVs and allow each follower CAV to\ntrack their leader CAV by using only local information interaction. We also\npresent a novel intermittent sampling condition and a robust intermittent\noptimization design that can ensure optimally scheduled feedback gains for the\ncooperative platooning tracking controllers to minimize the control cost under\nnonidentical inter-vehicle constraints and unknown jerk dynamics.

    "abstract": "Semi-unification is the combination of first-order unification and\nfirst-order matching. It does arise naturally in the context of polymorphically\nrecursive functional and logic programming. The undecidability of\nsemi-unification has been proven by Kfoury, Tiuryn, and Urzyczyn in the 1990s.\nThe original argument starts with the undecidability result by Hooper from the\n1960s for Turing machine immortality (existence of a diverging configuration).\nThe undecidability of semi-unification is established by Turing reduction from\nTuring machine immortality. The particular Turing reduction is intricate, uses\nnon-computational principles, and involves various intermediate models of\ncomputation.\nThere are several aspects of the existing work which can be improved upon in\nthe setting of constructive mathematics. First, many-one completeness of\nsemi-unification is not established due to the use of Turing reductions.\nSecond, existing mechanizations do not cover a comprehensive reduction from\nTuring machine halting to semi-unification. Third, reliance on principles such\nas K\\\"onig's lemma or the fan theorem does not support constructivity of the\narguments.\nImproving upon the above aspects, the present work gives a constructive\nmany-one reduction from the Turing machine halting problem to semi-unification.\nThis establishes many-one completeness of semi-unification. Computability of\nthe reduction function, constructivity of the argument, and correctness of the\nargument is witnessed by an axiom-free mechanization in the Coq proof\nassistant. Arguably, this serves as comprehensive, precise, and surveyable\nevidence for the result at hand.

PICO utilizes contrastive learning to integrate inter-task\nknowledge implicitly from the task representations in task-specific networks.\nIn addition, we introduce an auxiliary network to capture the inter-task\nrelevance at instance-level and transform it into personalized temperature\nparameters for contrastive learning. With this method, fine-grained knowledge\ncan be transferred to improve MTL performance without incurring additional\ninference costs. Both offline and online experiments show that PICO outperforms\nprevious multi-task models significantly.",

    "abstract": "Since computer science is still mainly male dominated, academia, industry and\neducation jointly seek ways to motivate and inspire girls, for example by\nintroducing them to programming at an early age. The recent COVID-19 pandemic\nhas forced many such endeavours to move to an online setting. While the\ngender-dependent differences in programming courses have been studied\npreviously, for example revealing that girls may feel safer in same-sex groups,\nmuch less is known about gender-specific differences in online programming\ncourses. In order to investigate whether gender-specific differences can be\nobserved in online courses, we conducted an online introductory programming\ncourse for Scratch, in which we observed the gender-specific characteristics of\nparticipants with respect to how they interact, their enjoyment, the code they\nproduce, and the creativity exposed by their programs. Overall, we observed no\nsignificant differences between how girls participated in all-female vs. mixed\ngroups, and girls generally engaged with the course more actively than boys.\nThis suggests that online courses can be a useful means to avoid\ngender-dependent group dynamics. However, when encouraging creative freedom in\nprogramming, girls and boys seem to fall back to socially inherited\nstereotypical behavior also in an online setting, influencing the choice of\nprogramming concepts applied. This may inhibit learning and is a challenge that\nneeds to be addressed independently of whether courses are held online.",

    "abstract": "Programmable robots are engaging and fun to play with, interact with the real\nworld, and are therefore well suited to introduce young learners to\nprogramming. Introductory robot programming languages often extend existing\nblock-based languages such as Scratch. While teaching programming with such\nlanguages is well established, the interaction with the real world in robot\nprograms leads to specific challenges, for which learners and educators may\nrequire assistance and feedback. A practical approach to provide this feedback\nis by identifying and pointing out patterns in the code that are indicative of\ngood or bad solutions. While such patterns have been defined for regular\nblock-based programs, robot-specific programming aspects have not been\nconsidered so far. The aim of this paper is therefore to identify patterns\nspecific to robot programming for the Scratch-based mBlock programming\nlanguage, which is used for the popular mBot and Codey Rocky robots. We\nidentify: (1) 26 bug patterns, which indicate erroneous code; (2) three code\nsmells, which indicate code that may work but is written in a confusing or\ndifficult to understand way; and (3) 18 code perfumes, which indicate aspects\nof code that are likely good. We extend the LitterBox analysis framework to\nautomatically identify these patterns in mBlock programs. Evaluated on a\ndataset of 3,540 mBlock programs, we find a total of 6,129 instances of bug\npatterns, 592 code smells and 14,495 code perfumes. This demonstrates the\npotential of our approach to provide feedback and assistance to learners and\neducators alike for their mBlock robot programs.",

    "abstract": "Current session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) mainly focus on maximizing\nrecommendation accuracy, while few studies have been devoted to improve\ndiversity beyond accuracy. Meanwhile, it is unclear how the accuracy-oriented\nSBRSs perform in terms of diversity. Besides, the asserted \"trade-off\"\nrelationship between accuracy and diversity has been increasingly questioned in\nthe literature. Towards the aforementioned issues, we conduct a holistic study\nto particularly examine the recommendation performance of representative SBRSs\nw.r.t. both accuracy and diversity, striving for better understanding the\ndiversity-related issues for SBRSs and providing guidance on designing\ndiversified SBRSs. Particularly, for a fair and thorough comparison, we\ndeliberately select state-of-the-art non-neural, deep neural, and diversified\nSBRSs, by covering more scenarios with appropriate experimental setups, e.g.,\nrepresentative datasets, evaluation metrics, and hyper-parameter optimization\ntechnique. Our empirical results unveil that: 1) non-diversified methods can\nalso obtain satisfying performance on diversity, which might even surpass\ndiversified ones; and 2) the relationship between accuracy and diversity is\nquite complex. Besides the \"trade-off\" relationship, they might be positively\ncorrelated with each other, that is, having a same-trend (win-win or lose-lose)\nrelationship, which varies across different methods and datasets. Additionally,\nwe further identify three possible influential factors on diversity in SBRSs\n(i.e., granularity of item categorization, session diversity of datasets, and\nlength of recommendation lists).",

    "abstract": "Computational thinking is increasingly introduced at primary school level,\nusually with some form of programming activity. In particular, educational\nrobots provide an opportunity for engaging students with programming through\nhands-on experiences. However, primary school teachers might not be adequately\nprepared for teaching computer science related topics, and giving feedback to\nstudents can often be challenging: Besides the content of the feedback (e.g.,\nwhat problems have to be handled), the way the feedback is given is also\nimportant, as it can lead to negative emotional effects. To support teachers\nwith the way of giving feedback on common problems when teaching programming\nwith robotics, we conducted a study consisting of seven workshops with three\nthird and four fourth grade primary school classes. Within seven different\nactivities, the 116 primary school children first programmed the Ozobot Evo\nrobot in the pen-and-paper mode and then on a digital device. Throughout these\nactivities we collected data on the problems the students encountered, the\nfeedback given, and the fun they experienced. Our analysis reveals eight\ncategories of problems, which we summarise in this paper together with\ncorresponding possible feedback. We observed that problems that are urgent or\ncan harm the students' self-efficacy have a negative impact on how enjoyable an\nactivity is perceived. While direct instruction significantly decreased the\nexperienced fun, hints had a positive effect. Generally, we found programming\nthe Ozobot Evo to be encouraging for both girls and boys. To support teachers,\nwe discuss ideas for giving encouraging feedback on common problems of Ozobot\nEvo programming activities and how our findings transfer to other robots.",

    "abstract": "Maximal (also miner) extractable value, or MEV, usually refers to the value\nthat privileged players can extract by strategically ordering, censoring, and\nplacing transactions in a blockchain. Each blockchain network, which we refer\nto as a domain, has its own consensus, ordering, and block-creation mechanisms,\nwhich gives rise to different optimal strategies to extract MEV. The strategic\nbehaviour of rational players, known as searchers, lead to MEV games that have\ndifferent impacts and externalities in each domain. Several ordering\nmechanisms, which determine the inclusion and position of transactions in a\nblock, have been considered to construct alternative games to organise MEV\nextraction, and minimize negative externalities; examples include sealed bid\nauctions, first input first output, and private priority gas auctions. However,\nto date, no sufficiently formal and abstract definition of MEV games have been\nmade. In this paper, we take a step toward the formalization of MEV games and\ncompare different ordering mechanisms and their externalities. In particular,\nwe attempt to formalize games that arise from common knowledge MEV\nopportunities, such as arbitrage and sandwich attacks. In defining these games,\nwe utilise a theoretical framework that provides groundwork for several\nimportant roles and concepts, such as the searcher, sequencer, domain, and\nbundle. We also introduce the price of MEV as the price of anarchy of MEV\ngames, a measure that provides formal comparison between different ordering\nmechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Conventional centralised deep learning paradigms are not feasible when data\nfrom different sources cannot be shared due to data privacy or transmission\nlimitation. To resolve this problem, federated learning has been introduced to\ntransfer knowledge across multiple sources (clients) with non-shared data while\noptimising a globally generalised central model (server). Existing federated\nlearning paradigms mostly focus on transferring holistic high-level knowledge\n(such as class) across models, which are closely related to specific objects of\ninterest so may suffer from inverse attack. In contrast, in this work, we\nconsider transferring mid-level semantic knowledge (such as attribute) which is\nnot sensitive to specific objects of interest and therefore is more\nprivacy-preserving and scalable. To this end, we formulate a new Federated\nZero-Shot Learning (FZSL) paradigm to learn mid-level semantic knowledge at\nmultiple local clients with non-shared local data and cumulatively aggregate a\nglobally generalised central model for deployment. To improve model\ndiscriminative ability, we propose to explore semantic knowledge augmentation\nfrom external knowledge for enriching the mid-level semantic space in FZSL.\nExtensive experiments on five zeroshot learning benchmark datasets validate the\neffectiveness of our approach for optimising a generalisable federated learning\nmodel with mid-level semantic knowledge transfer.",

This paper presents an\napproach to integrating IOTA and ROS 2 for more scalable DLT-based robotic\nsystems while allowing for network partition tolerance after deployment.

We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed framework for a cooperative mapping\napplication in a system with intermittent network connectivity.

In real-world\napplications, many few-shot tasks are correlated, particularly in a specialized\narea. However, such information is ignored by previous work. Inspired by the\nfact that modeling task relationships by multi-task learning can usually boost\nperformance, we propose a novel method SoftCPT (Soft Context Sharing for Prompt\nTuning) to fine-tune pre-trained vision-language models on multiple target\nfew-shot tasks, simultaneously. Specifically, we design a task-shared meta\nnetwork to generate prompt vector for each task using pre-defined task name\ntogether with a learnable meta prompt as input. As such, the prompt vectors of\nall tasks will be shared in a soft manner. The parameters of this shared meta\nnetwork as well as the meta prompt vector are tuned on the joint training set\nof all target tasks. Extensive experiments on three multi-task few-shot\ndatasets show that SoftCPT outperforms the representative single-task prompt\ntuning method CoOp [78] by a large margin, implying the effectiveness of\nmulti-task learning in vision-language prompt tuning.

    "title": "A Missing Value Filling Model Based on Feature Fusion Enhanced  Autoencoder",
    "abstract": "With the advent of the big data era, the data quality problem is becoming\nmore and more crucial. Among many factors, data with missing values is one\nprimary issue, and thus developing effective imputation models is a key topic\nin the research community. Recently, a major research direction is to employ\nneural network models such as selforganizing mappings or automatic encoders for\nfilling missing values. However, these classical methods can hardly discover\ncorrelation features and common features simultaneously among data attributes.\nEspecially,it is a very typical problem for classical autoencoders that they\noften learn invalid constant mappings, thus dramatically hurting the filling\nperformance. To solve the above problems, we propose and develop a\nmissing-value-filling model based on a feature-fusion-enhanced autoencoder. We\nfirst design and incorporate into an autoencoder a hidden layer that consists\nof de-tracking neurons and radial basis function neurons, which can enhance the\nability to learn correlated features and common features. Besides, we develop a\nmissing value filling strategy based on dynamic clustering (MVDC) that is\nincorporated into an iterative optimization process. This design can enhance\nthe multi-dimensional feature fusion ability and thus improves the dynamic\ncollaborative missing-value-filling performance. The effectiveness of our model\nis validated by experimental comparisons to many missing-value-filling methods\nthat are tested on seven datasets with different missing rates.",

    "title": "Generalization In Multi-Objective Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "Modern machine learning tasks often require considering not just one but\nmultiple objectives. For example, besides the prediction quality, this could be\nthe efficiency, robustness or fairness of the learned models, or any of their\ncombinations. Multi-objective learning offers a natural framework for handling\nsuch problems without having to commit to early trade-offs. Surprisingly,\nstatistical learning theory so far offers almost no insight into the\ngeneralization properties of multi-objective learning. In this work, we make\nfirst steps to fill this gap: we establish foundational generalization bounds\nfor the multi-objective setting as well as generalization and excess bounds for\nlearning with scalarizations. We also provide the first theoretical analysis of\nthe relation between the Pareto-optimal sets of the true objectives and the\nPareto-optimal sets of their empirical approximations from training data. In\nparticular, we show a surprising asymmetry: all Pareto-optimal solutions can be\napproximated by empirically Pareto-optimal ones, but not vice versa.",

    "abstract": "Satellite images constitute a highly valuable and abundant resource for many\nreal world applications. However, the labeled data needed to train most machine\nlearning models are scarce and difficult to obtain. In this context, the\ncurrent work investigates a fully unsupervised methodology that, given a\ntemporal sequence of satellite images, creates a partition of the ground\naccording to its semantic properties and their evolution over time. The\nsequences of images are translated into a grid of multivariate time series of\nembedded tiles. The embedding and the partitional clustering of these sequences\nof tiles are constructed in two iterative steps: In the first step, the\nembedding is able to extract the information of the sequences of tiles based on\na geographical neighborhood, and the tiles are grouped into clusters. In the\nsecond step, the embedding is refined by using the neighborhood defined by the\nclusters, and the final clustering of the sequences of tiles is obtained. We\nillustrate the methodology by conducting the semantic clustering of a sequence\nof 20 satellite images of the region of Navarra (Spain). The results show that\nthe clustering of multivariate time series is robust and contains trustful\nspatio-temporal semantic information about the region under study. We unveil\nthe close connection that exists between the geographic and embedded spaces,\nand find out that the semantic properties attributed to these kinds of\nembeddings are fully exploited and even enhanced by the proposed clustering of\ntime series.",

In\nthe sixth paper, exact analysis of the wave propagation in a beam with\nrectangular cross section is extended to a thorough multiscale analysis for a\nsystem of completely coupled second order linear differential equations for\nmodal functions, where general boundary conditions are prescribed. For this\npurpose, the modal function each is expressed as a linear combination of the\ncorner function, the two boundary functions and the internal function, to\nensure the series expressions obtained uniformly convergent and termwise\ndifferentiable up to second order. Meanwhile, the sum of the corner function\nand the internal function corresponds to the particular solution, and the two\nboundary functions correspond to the general solutions which satisfy the\nhomogeneous form of the equations. Since the general solutions have\nappropriately interpreted the meaning of the differential equations, the\nspatial characteristics of the solution of the equations are expected to be\nbetter captured in separate directions. With the corner function, the two\nboundary functions and the internal function selected specifically as\npolynomials, one-dimensional full-range Fourier series along the x2 (or\nx1)-direction, and two-dimensional full-range Fourier series, the Fourier\nseries multiscale solution of the wave propagation in a beam with rectangular\ncross section is derived.

    "abstract": "Process mining is a set of techniques that are used by organizations to\nunderstand and improve their operational processes. The first essential step in\ndesigning any process reengineering procedure is to find process improvement\nopportunities. In existing work, it is usually assumed that the set of\nproblematic process instances in which an undesirable outcome occurs is known\nprior or is easily detectable. So the process enhancement procedure involves\nfinding the root causes and the treatments for the problem in those process\ninstances. For example, the set of problematic instances is considered as those\nwith outlier values or with values smaller/bigger than a given threshold in one\nof the process features. However, on various occasions, using this approach,\nmany process enhancement opportunities, not captured by these problematic\nprocess instances, are missed. To overcome this issue, we formulate finding the\nprocess enhancement areas as a context-sensitive anomaly/outlier detection\nproblem. We define a process enhancement area as a set of situations (process\ninstances or prefixes of process instances) where the process performance is\nsurprising. We aim to characterize those situations where process\nperformance/outcome is significantly different from what was expected\nconsidering its performance/outcome in similar situations. To evaluate the\nvalidity and relevance of the proposed approach, we have implemented and\nevaluated it on several real-life event logs.",

    "abstract": "Systems for relative localization in multi-robot systems based on\nultra-wideband (UWB) ranging have recently emerged as robust solutions for\nGNSS-denied environments. Scalability remains one of the key challenges,\nparticularly in ad-hoc deployments. Recent solutions include dynamic allocation\nof active and passive localization modes for different robots or nodes in the\nsystem. With larger-scale systems becoming more distributed, key research\nquestions arise in the areas of security and trustability of such localization\nsystems. This paper studies the potential integration of collaborative-decision\nmaking processes with distributed ledger technologies. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the design and implementation of a methodology for running an UWB\nrole allocation algorithm within smart contracts in a blockchain. In previous\nworks, we have separately studied the integration of ROS2 with the Hyperledger\nFabric blockchain, and introduced a new algorithm for scalable UWB-based\nlocalization. In this paper, we extend these works by (i) running experiments\nwith larger number of mobile robots switching between different spatial\nconfigurations and (ii) integrating the dynamic UWB role allocation algorithm\ninto Fabric smart contracts for distributed decision-making in a system of\nmultiple mobile robots. This enables us to deliver the same functionality\nwithin a secure and trustable process, with enhanced identity and data access\nmanagement. Our results show the effectiveness of the UWB role allocation for\ncontinuously varying spatial formations of six autonomous mobile robots, while\ndemonstrating a low impact on latency and computational resources of adding the\nblockchain layer that does not affect the localization process.",

    "title": "Learning a General Clause-to-Clause Relationships for Enhancing  Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction",
    "abstract": "Emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE) is an emerging task aiming to extract\npotential pairs of emotions and corresponding causes from documents. Previous\napproaches have focused on modeling the pair-to-pair relationship and achieved\npromising results. However, the clause-to-clause relationship, which\nfundamentally symbolizes the underlying structure of a document, has still been\nin its research infancy. In this paper, we define a novel clause-to-clause\nrelationship. To learn it applicably, we propose a general clause-level\nencoding model named EA-GAT comprising E-GAT and Activation Sort. E-GAT is\ndesigned to aggregate information from different types of clauses; Activation\nSort leverages the individual emotion/cause prediction and the sort-based\nmapping to propel the clause to a more favorable representation. Since EA-GAT\nis a clause-level encoding model, it can be broadly integrated with any\nprevious approach. Experimental results show that our approach has a\nsignificant advantage over all current approaches on the Chinese and English\nbenchmark corpus, with an average of $2.1\\%$ and $1.03\\%$.",

Such models\npredict how people perceive the urban environment quality in terms of e.g. its\nsafety or beauty. However, the blackbox nature of deep learning models hampers\nurban planners to understand what landscape objects contribute to a\nparticularly high quality or low quality urban space perception. This study\ninvestigates how computer vision models can be used to extract relevant policy\ninformation about peoples' perception of the urban space. To do so, we train\ntwo widely used computer vision architectures; a Convolutional Neural Network\nand a transformer, and apply GradCAM -- a well-known ex-post explainable AI\ntechnique -- to highlight the image regions important for the model's\nprediction. Using these GradCAM visualizations, we manually annotate the\nobjects relevant to the models' perception predictions. As a result, we are\nable to discover new objects that are not represented in present object\ndetection models used for annotation in previous studies. Moreover, our\nmethodological results suggest that transformer architectures are better suited\nto be used in combination with GradCAM techniques. Code is available on Github.",

    "abstract": "This tutorial provides a complete and homogeneous account of the latest\nadvances in fine- and coarse-grained dynamic information-flow control (IFC)\nsecurity. Since the 70s, the programming language and the operating system\ncommunities have proposed different IFC approaches. IFC operating systems track\ninformation flows in a coarse-grained fashion, at the granularity of a process.\nIn contrast, traditional language-based approaches to IFC are fine-grained:\nthey track information flows at the granularity of program variables. For\ndecades, researchers believed coarse-grained IFC to be strictly less permissive\nthan fine-grained IFC -- coarse-grained IFC systems seem inherently less\nprecise because they track less information -- and so granularity appeared to\nbe a fundamental feature of IFC systems. We show that the granularity of the\ntracking system does not fundamentally restrict how precise or permissive\ndynamic IFC systems can be. To this end, we mechanize two mostly standard\nlanguages, one with a fine-grained dynamic IFC system and the other with a\ncoarse-grained dynamic IFC system, and prove a semantics-preserving translation\nfrom each language to the other. In addition, we derive the standard security\nproperty of non-interference of each language from that of the other via our\nverified translation. These translations stand to have important implications\non the usability of IFC approaches. The coarse- to fine-grained direction can\nbe used to remove the label annotation burden that fine-grained systems impose\non developers, while the fine- to coarse-grained translation shows that\ncoarse-grained systems -- which are easier to design and implement -- can track\ninformation as precisely as fine-grained systems and provides an algorithm for\nautomatically retrofitting legacy applications to run on existing\ncoarse-grained systems.",

Likelihoods produced by deep generative models, although\nextensively studied, have been largely dismissed as being impractical for\noutlier detection. For one, deep generative model likelihoods are readily\nbiased by low-level input statistics. Second, many recent solutions for\ncorrecting these biases are computationally expensive or do not generalize well\nto complex, natural datasets. Here, we explore outlier detection with a\nstate-of-the-art deep autoregressive model: PixelCNN++. We show that biases in\nPixelCNN++ likelihoods arise primarily from predictions based on local\ndependencies. We propose two families of bijective transformations that we term\n\"shaking\" and \"stirring\", which ameliorate low-level biases and isolate the\ncontribution of long-range dependencies to the PixelCNN++ likelihood. These\ntransformations are computationally inexpensive and readily applied at\nevaluation time.

    "abstract": "Most programs compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm) today are written in unsafe\nlanguages like C and C++. Unfortunately, memory-unsafe C code remains unsafe\nwhen compiled to Wasm -- and attackers can exploit buffer overflows and\nuse-after-frees in Wasm almost as easily as they can on native platforms.\nMemory-Safe WebAssembly (MSWasm) proposes to extend Wasm with language-level\nmemory-safety abstractions to precisely address this problem. In this paper, we\nbuild on the original MSWasm position paper to realize this vision. We give a\nprecise and formal semantics of MSWasm, and prove that well-typed MSWasm\nprograms are, by construction, robustly memory safe. To this end, we develop a\nnovel, language-independent memory-safety property based on colored memory\nlocations and pointers. This property also lets us reason about the security\nguarantees of a formal C-to-MSWasm compiler -- and prove that it always\nproduces memory-safe programs (and preserves the semantics of safe programs).\nWe use these formal results to then guide several implementations: Two\ncompilers of MSWasm to native code, and a C-to-MSWasm compiler (that extends\nClang). Our MSWasm compilers support different enforcement mechanisms, allowing\ndevelopers to make security-performance trade-offs according to their needs.\nOur evaluation shows that the overhead of enforcing memory safety in software\nranges from 22% (enforcing spatial safety alone) to 198% (enforcing full memory\nsafety) on the PolyBenchC suite. More importantly, MSWasm's design makes it\neasy to swap between enforcement mechanisms; as fast (especially\nhardware-based) enforcement techniques become available, MSWasm will be able to\ntake advantage of these advances almost for free.",

    "abstract": "To improve the security and reliability of wind energy production, short-term\nforecasting has become of utmost importance. This study focuses on multi-step\nspatio-temporal wind speed forecasting for the Norwegian continental shelf. A\ngraph neural network (GNN) architecture was used to extract spatial\ndependencies, with different update functions to learn temporal correlations.\nThese update functions were implemented using different neural network\narchitectures. One such architecture, the Transformer, has become increasingly\npopular for sequence modelling in recent years. Various alterations of the\noriginal architecture have been proposed to better facilitate time-series\nforecasting, of which this study focused on the Informer, LogSparse Transformer\nand Autoformer. This is the first time the LogSparse Transformer and Autoformer\nhave been applied to wind forecasting and the first time any of these or the\nInformer have been formulated in a spatio-temporal setting for wind\nforecasting. By comparing against spatio-temporal Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nand Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models, the study showed that the models using\nthe altered Transformer architectures as update functions in GNNs were able to\noutperform these. Furthermore, we propose the Fast Fourier Transformer\n(FFTransformer), which is a novel Transformer architecture based on signal\ndecomposition and consists of two separate streams that analyse trend and\nperiodic components separately. The FFTransformer and Autoformer were found to\nachieve superior results for the 10-minute and 1-hour ahead forecasts, with the\nFFTransformer significantly outperforming all other models for the 4-hour ahead\nforecasts. Finally, by varying the degree of connectivity for the graph\nrepresentations, the study explicitly demonstrates how all models were able to\nleverage spatial dependencies to improve local short-term wind speed\nforecasting.",

    "abstract": "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a sampling best-first method to search for\noptimal decisions. The success of MCTS depends heavily on how the tree is built\nand the selection process plays a fundamental role in this. One particular\nselection mechanism that has proved to be reliable is based on the Upper\nConfidence Bounds for Trees (UCT). The UCT attempts to balance exploration and\nexploitation by considering the values stored in the statistical tree of the\nMCTS. However, some tuning of the MCTS UCT is necessary for this to work well.\nIn this work, we use Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to evolve mathematical\nexpressions with the goal to substitute the UCT formula and use the evolved\nexpressions in MCTS. More specifically, we evolve expressions by means of our\nproposed Semantic-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm in MCTS approach (SIEA-MCTS).\nThis is inspired by semantics in Genetic Programming (GP), where the use of\nfitness cases is seen as a requirement to be adopted in GP. Fitness cases are\nnormally used to determine the fitness of individuals and can be used to\ncompute the semantic similarity (or dissimilarity) of individuals. However,\nfitness cases are not available in MCTS. We extend this notion by using\nmultiple reward values from MCTS that allow us to determine both the fitness of\nan individual and its semantics. By doing so, we show how SIEA-MCTS is able to\nsuccessfully evolve mathematical expressions that yield better or competitive\nresults compared to UCT without the need of tuning these evolved expressions.\nWe compare the performance of the proposed SIEA-MCTS against MCTS algorithms,\nMCTS Rapid Action Value Estimation algorithms, three variants of the *-minimax\nfamily of algorithms, a random controller and two more EA approaches. We\nconsistently show how SIEA-MCTS outperforms most of these intelligent\ncontrollers in the challenging game of Carcassonne.",

Previously, the research\ncommunity tries to improve the performance of each single aspect but failed to\npresent a unified solution on the joint search of the optimal designs for all\nthree aspects. In this paper, we for the first time identify that these aspects\nare tightly coupled to each other. Optimizing the design of each aspect\nactually greatly limits the performance and biases the algorithmic design.\nSpecifically, we find that the optimal model architecture or loss function is\nclosely coupled with the data cleaning. To eliminate the bias of single-aspect\nresearch and provide an overall understanding of the face recognition model\ndesign, we first carefully design the search space for each aspect, then a\ncomprehensive search method is introduced to jointly search optimal data\ncleaning, architecture, and loss function design. In our framework, we make the\nproposed comprehensive search as flexible as possible, by using an innovative\nreinforcement learning based approach. Extensive experiments on million-level\nface recognition benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly-designed\nsearch space for each aspect and the comprehensive search. We outperform expert\nalgorithms developed for each single research track by large margins. More\nimportantly, we analyze the difference between our searched optimal design and\nthe independent design of the single factors.

However, creating tests for programs that have the purpose of\nchallenging human players is a daunting task for automatic test generators.\nEven if test generation succeeds in finding a relevant sequence of events to\nexercise a program, the randomized nature of games means that it may neither be\npossible to reproduce the exact program behavior underlying this sequence, nor\nto create test assertions checking if observed randomized game behavior is\ncorrect. To overcome these problems, we propose Neatest, a novel test generator\nbased on the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. Neatest\nsystematically explores a program's statements, and creates neural networks\nthat operate the program in order to reliably reach each statement -- that is,\nNeatest learns to play the game in a way to reliably cover different parts of\nthe code. As the networks learn the actual game behavior, they can also serve\nas test oracles by evaluating how surprising the observed behavior of a program\nunder test is compared to a supposedly correct version of the program. We\nevaluate this approach in the context of Scratch, an educational programming\nenvironment.

    "abstract": "Computing maximum weight independent sets in graphs is an important NP-hard\noptimization problem. The problem is particularly difficult to solve in large\ngraphs for which data reduction techniques do not work well. To be more\nprecise, state-of-the-art branch-and-reduce algorithms can solve many\nlarge-scale graphs if reductions are applicable. However, if this is not the\ncase, their performance quickly degrades due to branching requiring exponential\ntime. In this paper, we develop an advanced memetic algorithm to tackle the\nproblem, which incorporates recent data reduction techniques to compute\nnear-optimal weighted independent sets in huge sparse networks. More precisely,\nwe use a memetic approach to recursively choose vertices that are likely to be\nin a large-weight independent set. We include these vertices into the solution,\nand then further reduce the graph. We show that identifying and removing\nvertices likely to be in large-weight independent sets opens up the reduction\nspace and speeds up the computation of large-weight independent sets\nremarkably. Our experimental evaluation indicates that we are able to\noutperform state-of-the-art algorithms. For example, our algorithm computes the\nbest results among all competing algorithms for 33 out of 35 instances.

In this paper, we\nexplore how to teach students the model from a curriculum learning (CL)\nperspective and propose a new approach, namely \"CuDFKD\", i.e., \"Data-Free\nKnowledge Distillation with Curriculum\". It gradually learns from easy samples\nto difficult samples, which is similar to the way humans learn.

    "abstract": "Multi-view learning has progressed rapidly in recent years. Although many\nprevious studies assume that each instance appears in all views, it is common\nin real-world applications for instances to be missing from some views,\nresulting in incomplete multi-view data. To tackle this problem, we propose a\nnovel Latent Heterogeneous Graph Network (LHGN) for incomplete multi-view\nlearning, which aims to use multiple incomplete views as fully as possible in a\nflexible manner. By learning a unified latent representation, a trade-off\nbetween consistency and complementarity among different views is implicitly\nrealized. To explore the complex relationship between samples and latent\nrepresentations, a neighborhood constraint and a view-existence constraint are\nproposed, for the first time, to construct a heterogeneous graph. Finally, to\navoid any inconsistencies between training and test phase, a transductive\nlearning technique is applied based on graph learning for classification tasks.\nExtensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model over existing state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "Near-term quantum computers will operate in a noisy environment, without\nerror correction. A critical problem for near-term quantum computing is laying\nout a logical circuit onto a physical device with limited connectivity between\nqubits. This is known as the qubit mapping and routing (QMR) problem, an\nintractable combinatorial problem. It is important to solve QMR as optimally as\npossible to reduce the amount of added noise, which may render a quantum\ncomputation useless. In this paper, we present a novel approach for optimally\nsolving the QMR problem via a reduction to maximum satisfiability (MAXSAT).\nAdditionally, we present two novel relaxation ideas that shrink the size of the\nMAXSAT constraints by exploiting the structure of a quantum circuit. Our\nthorough empirical evaluation demonstrates (1) the scalability of our approach\ncompared to state-of-the-art optimal QMR techniques (solves more than 3x\nbenchmarks with 40x speedup), (2) the significant cost reduction compared to\nstate-of-the-art heuristic approaches (an average of ~5x swap reduction), and\n(3) the power of our proposed constraint relaxations.",

FedEgo\napplies GraphSAGE over ego-graphs to make full use of the structure information\nand utilizes Mixup for privacy concerns.

Compositionality in RL\nhas the potential to create modular subtask units that interface with other\nsystem capabilities. However, generating compositional models requires the\ncharacterization of minimal assumptions for the robustness of the compositional\nfeature. We develop a framework for a \\emph{compositional theory} of RL using a\ncategorical point of view. Given the categorical representation of\ncompositionality, we investigate sufficient conditions under which\nlearning-by-parts results in the same optimal policy as learning on the whole.\nIn particular, our approach introduces a category $\\mathsf{MDP}$, whose objects\nare Markov decision processes (MDPs) acting as models of tasks. We show that\n$\\mathsf{MDP}$ admits natural compositional operations, such as certain fiber\nproducts and pushouts. These operations make explicit compositional phenomena\nin RL and unify existing constructions, such as puncturing hazardous states in\ncomposite MDPs and incorporating state-action symmetry.

However, they usually suffer from high human\ndependency, input restriction, and loosely-coupled bindings of topology and\nattributes, thus may have limited substantial improvements to the layout\nquality. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based graph exploration\npipeline to enjoy the best of both graph topology and node attributes.

Next, graph explorations are extended based on the generated graph\nlayout and insights extracted from the embedding vectors.

In it, we have $m$ resources and $n$ requests. Each request\nhas multiple possible configurations, each of which increases the load of each\nresource by some amount. The goal is to select one configuration for each\nrequest to minimize the makespan: the load of the most-loaded resource. In our\nwork, we focus on a stochastic setting, where we only know the distribution for\nhow each configuration increases the resource loads, learning the realized\nvalue only after a configuration is chosen.\nWe develop both offline and online algorithms for configuration balancing\nwith stochastic requests. When the requests are known offline, we give a\nnon-adaptive policy for configuration balancing with stochastic requests that\n$O(\\frac{\\log m}{\\log \\log m})$-approximates the optimal adaptive policy. In\nparticular, this closes the adaptivity gap for this problem as there is an\nasymptotically matching lower bound even for the very special case of load\nbalancing on identical machines. When requests arrive online in a list, we give\na non-adaptive policy that is $O(\\log m)$ competitive. Again, this result is\nasymptotically tight due to information-theoretic lower bounds for very special\ncases (e.g., for load balancing on unrelated machines). Finally, we show how to\nleverage adaptivity in the special case of load balancing on related machines\nto obtain a constant-factor approximation offline and an $O(\\log \\log\nm)$-approximation online.

In this paper, we conduct systematic\nanalyses on the motion jittering problem based on a state-of-the-art pipeline\nthat uses 3D face representations to bridge the input audio and output video,\nand improve the motion stability with a series of effective designs. We find\nthat several issues can lead to jitters in synthesized talking face video: 1)\njitters from the input 3D face representations; 2) training-inference mismatch;\n3) lack of dependency modeling among video frames. Accordingly, we propose\nthree effective solutions to address this issue: 1) we propose a gaussian-based\nadaptive smoothing module to smooth the 3D face representations to eliminate\njitters in the input; 2) we add augmented erosions on the input data of the\nneural renderer in training to simulate the distortion in inference to reduce\nmismatch; 3) we develop an audio-fused transformer generator to model\ndependency among video frames. Besides, considering there is no off-the-shelf\nmetric for measuring motion jitters in talking face video, we devise an\nobjective metric (Motion Stability Index, MSI), to quantitatively measure the\nmotion jitters by calculating the reciprocal of variance acceleration.\nExtensive experimental results show the superiority of our method on\nmotion-stable face video generation, with better quality than previous systems.",

Consequently, the model value raises\nincentive for adversary to steal the model for profits, such as the\nrepresentative model extraction attack. Emerging attack can leverage\ntiming-sensitive architecture-level events (i.e., Arch-hints) disclosed in\nhardware platforms to extract DNN model layer information accurately. In this\npaper, we take the first step to uncover the root cause of such Arch-hints and\nsummarize the principles to identify them. We then apply these principles to\nemerging Unified Memory (UM) management system and identify three new\nArch-hints caused by UM's unique data movement patterns. We then develop a new\nextraction attack, UMProbe. We also create the first DNN benchmark suite in UM\nand utilize the benchmark suite to evaluate UMProbe. Our evaluation shows that\nUMProbe can extract the layer sequence with an accuracy of 95% for almost all\nvictim test models, which thus calls for more attention to the DNN security in\nUM system.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments for Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SSOD) have shown\nthe promise of leveraging unlabeled data to improve an object detector.\nHowever, thus far these methods have assumed that the unlabeled data does not\ncontain out-of-distribution (OOD) classes, which is unrealistic with\nlarger-scale unlabeled datasets. In this paper, we consider a more practical\nyet challenging problem, Open-Set Semi-Supervised Object Detection (OSSOD). We\nfirst find the existing SSOD method obtains a lower performance gain in\nopen-set conditions, and this is caused by the semantic expansion, where the\ndistracting OOD objects are mispredicted as in-distribution pseudo-labels for\nthe semi-supervised training. To address this problem, we consider online and\noffline OOD detection modules, which are integrated with SSOD methods. With the\nextensive studies, we found that leveraging an offline OOD detector based on a\nself-supervised vision transformer performs favorably against online OOD\ndetectors due to its robustness to the interference of pseudo-labeling. In the\nexperiment, our proposed framework effectively addresses the semantic expansion\nissue and shows consistent improvements on many OSSOD benchmarks, including\nlarge-scale COCO-OpenImages. We also verify the effectiveness of our framework\nunder different OSSOD conditions, including varying numbers of in-distribution\nclasses, different degrees of supervision, and different combinations of\nunlabeled sets.",

    "abstract": "Grant-Free (GF) access has been recognized as a promising candidate for\nUltra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC). However, even with GF\naccess, URLLC still may not effectively gain high reliability and\nmillimeter-level latency, simultaneously. This is because the network load is\ntypically time-varying and not known to the base station (BS), and thus, the\nresource allocated for GF access cannot well adapt to variations of the network\nload, resulting in low resource utilization efficiency under light network load\nand leading to severe collisions under heavy network load. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose a multi-tier-driven computing framework and the associated\nalgorithms for URLLC to support users with different QoS requirements.\nEspecially, we concentrate on K - repetition GF access in light of its\nsimplicity and well-balanced performance for practical systems. In particular,\nour framework consists of three tiers of computation, namely network-load\nlearning, network-load prediction, and adaptive resource allocation. In the\nfirst tier, the BS can learn the network-load information from the states\n(success, collision, and idle) of random-access resources in terms of resource\nblocks (RB) and time slots. In the second tier, the network-load variation is\neffectively predicted based on estimation results from the first tier. Finally,\nin the third tier, by deriving and weighing the failure probabilities of\ndifferent groups of users, their QoS requirements, and the predicted network\nloads, the BS is able to dynamically allocate sufficient resources\naccommodating the varying network loads. Simulation results show that our\nproposed approach can estimate the network load more accurately compared with\nthe baseline schemes. Moreover, our adaptive resource allocation offers an\neffective way to enhance the QoS for different URLLC services, simultaneously.",

Interference is one of the most\nimportant challenges in cellular networks which causes problems by reducing the\nquality of the service. Cell-Free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) is a novel technolgy in which a large number of distributed access\npoints (APs) are concurrently serving a small number of user equipment (UE). CF\nnetwork can be an alternative technology to cellular networks for reducing\ninterference. A challenging task in a CF network is scalability, where although\nthe number of UEs tends to infinity, the computational complexity must remain\nfinite in each AP or UE. In this paper, we provide two architectures of Dense\nfully connected neural network (Dense_Net) and 1D convolution neural network\n(Conv_Net) to be implemented in different cases in terms of the number of\nantennas in each AP/UE and the method for the combining vector.

Then, optimum\northogonal decomposition of the compressible topological vector space can be\nformulated as a limit for which minimal linear functional occurs.

    "abstract": "As state-of-the-art quantum computers are capable of running increasingly\ncomplex algorithms, the need for automated methods to design and test potential\napplications rises. Equivalence checking of quantum circuits is an important,\nyet hardly automated, task in the development of the quantum software stack.\nRecently, new methods have been proposed that tackle this problem from widely\ndifferent perspectives. One of them is based on the ZX-calculus, a graphical\nrewriting system for quantum computing. However, the power and capability of\nthis equivalence checking method has barely been explored. The aim of this work\nis to evaluate the ZX-calculus as a tool for equivalence checking of quantum\ncircuits. To this end, it is demonstrated how the ZX-calculus based approach\nfor equivalence checking can be expanded in order to verify the results of\ncompilation flows and optimizations on quantum circuits. It is also shown that\nthe ZX-calculus based method is not complete$\\unicode{x2014}$especially for\nquantum circuits with ancillary qubits. In order to properly evaluate the\nproposed method, we conduct a detailed case study by comparing it to two other\nstate-of-the-art methods for equivalence checking: one based on path-sums and\nanother based on decision diagrams. The proposed methods have been integrated\ninto the publicly available QCEC tool (https://github.com/cda-tum/qcec) which\nis part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT).",

    "abstract": "Dwarf galaxies are small, dark matter-dominated galaxies, some of which are\nembedded within the Milky Way. Their lack of baryonic matter (e.g., stars and\ngas) makes them perfect test beds for probing the properties of dark matter --\nunderstanding the spatial dark matter distribution in these systems can be used\nto constrain microphysical dark matter interactions that influence the\nformation and evolution of structures in our Universe. We introduce a new\nmethod that leverages simulation-based inference and graph-based machine\nlearning in order to infer the dark matter density profiles of dwarf galaxies\nfrom observable kinematics of stars gravitationally bound to these systems. Our\napproach aims to address some of the limitations of established methods based\non dynamical Jeans modeling. We show that this novel method can place stronger\nconstraints on dark matter profiles and, consequently, has the potential to\nweigh in on some of the ongoing puzzles associated with the small-scale\nstructure of dark matter halos, such as the core-cusp discrepancy.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian processes are a key component of many flexible statistical and\nmachine learning models. However, they exhibit cubic computational complexity\nand high memory constraints due to the need of inverting and storing a full\ncovariance matrix. To circumvent this, mixtures of Gaussian process experts\nhave been considered where data points are assigned to independent experts,\nreducing the complexity by allowing inference based on smaller, local\ncovariance matrices. Moreover, mixtures of Gaussian process experts\nsubstantially enrich the model's flexibility, allowing for behaviors such as\nnon-stationarity, heteroscedasticity, and discontinuities. In this work, we\nconstruct a novel inference approach based on nested sequential Monte Carlo\nsamplers to simultaneously infer both the gating network and Gaussian process\nexpert parameters.

    "abstract": "In whole slide imaging, commonly used staining techniques based on\nhematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains accentuate\ndifferent aspects of the tissue landscape. In the case of detecting metastases,\nIHC provides a distinct readout that is readily interpretable by pathologists.\nIHC, however, is a more expensive approach and not available at all medical\ncenters. Virtually generating IHC images from H&E using deep neural networks\nthus becomes an attractive alternative. Deep generative models such as\nCycleGANs learn a semantically-consistent mapping between two image domains,\nwhile emulating the textural properties of each domain. They are therefore a\nsuitable choice for stain transfer applications. However, they remain fully\nunsupervised, and possess no mechanism for enforcing biological consistency in\nstain transfer. In this paper, we propose an extension to CycleGANs in the form\nof a region of interest discriminator. This allows the CycleGAN to learn from\nunpaired datasets where, in addition, there is a partial annotation of objects\nfor which one wishes to enforce consistency. We present a use case on whole\nslide images, where an IHC stain provides an experimentally generated signal\nfor metastatic cells.

Fully-automated processing and quantitative analysis of\nmulti-modality cardiac images could have a direct impact on clinical research\nand evidence-based patient management.

The review highlights that multi-modality\ncardiac imaging data has the potential of wide applicability in the clinic,\nsuch as trans-aortic valve implantation guidance, myocardial viability\nassessment, and catheter ablation therapy and its patient selection.\nNevertheless, many challenges remain unsolved, such as missing modality,\ncombination of imaging and non-imaging data, and uniform analysis and\nrepresentation of different modalities.

    "abstract": "The electricity market clearing is usually implemented via an open-loop\npredict-then-optimize (O-PO) process: it first predicts the available power of\nrenewable energy sources (RES) and the system reserve requirements; then, given\nthe predictions, the markets are cleared via optimization models, i.e., unit\ncommitment (UC) and economic dispatch (ED), to pursue the optimal electricity\nmarket economy. However, the market economy could suffer from the open-loop\nprocess because its predictions may be overly myopic to the optimizations,\ni.e., the predictions seek to improve the immediate statistical forecasting\nerrors instead of the ultimate market economy. To this end, this paper proposes\na closed-loop predict-and-optimize (C-PO) framework based on the tri-level\nmixed-integer programming, which trains economy-oriented predictors tailored\nfor the market-clearing optimization to improve the ultimate market economy.\nSpecifically, the upper level trains the economy-oriented RES and reserve\npredictors according to their induced market economy; the middle and lower\nlevels, with given predictions, mimic the market-clearing process and feed the\ninduced market economy results back to the upper level. The trained\neconomy-oriented predictors are then embedded into the UC model, forming a\nprescriptive UC model that can simultaneously provide RES-reserve predictions\nand UC decisions with enhanced market economy. Numerical case studies on an\nIEEE 118-bus system illustrate potential economic and practical advantages of\nC-PO over O-PO, robust UC, and stochastic UC.",

Aiming to identify representative qualitative features of the\nAHU-to-TCL coupling, we build a realistic but also sufficiently simple model\nand analyze it in two distinct regimes: the Constant Supply Temperature (CST)\nand the Constant Power Input (CPI) regimes. In both cases, we center our\nanalysis on the relaxation dynamics of individual TCL temperatures to a\nstatistically steady state. We observe that while the dynamics are relatively\nfast in the CST regime, resulting in all TCLs evolving around the control\nsetpoint, the CPI regime reveals emergence of a \\emph{bi-modal probability\ndistribution and two, possibly strongly separated, time scales}. We observe\nthat the two modes in the CPI regime are associated with all TCLs being in the\nsame low and high-temperature states, respectively, with occasional (and\ntherefore possibly rare) collective transition between the modes akin in the\nKramer's phenomenon of statistical physics.

MeaFormer can enhance\nhigh-resolution features by employing transformers to capture their long-range\ndependencies. Two consistency losses are introduced to explicitly build\nrelationships among these tasks for better optimization. Experiments show that\nMeaFormer achieves the state-of-the-art performance of LRDPS on the large-scale\nDeepLesion dataset and produces promising results of two downstream\nclinic-relevant tasks, i.e., 3D lesion segmentation and RECIST assessment in\nlongitudinal studies.",

Therefore, an algorithm that can achieve both\nautomatic extraction of low-dimensional features from the data and guarantee\nthe validity of the features is needed to improve the performance and\nconfidence of the accident diagnosis system. This study proposes an\nautoencoder-based autonomous learning framework, namely Padded Auto-Encoder\n(PAE), which is able to automatically encode accident monitoring data that has\nbeen noise-added and with partially missing data into low-dimensional feature\nvectors via a Vision Transformer-based encoder, and to decode the feature\nvectors into noise-free and complete reconstructed monitoring data. Thus, the\nencoder part of the framework is able to automatically infer valid\nrepresentations from partially missing and noisy monitoring data that reflect\nthe complete and noise-free original data, and the representation vectors can\nbe used for downstream tasks for accident diagnosis or else. In this paper,\nLOCA of HPR1000 was used as the study object, and the PAE was trained by an\nunsupervised method using cases with different break locations and sizes as the\ndataset. The encoder part of the pre-trained PAE was subsequently used as the\nfeature extractor for the monitoring data, and several basic statistical\nlearning algorithms for predicting the break locations and sizes. The results\nof the study show that the pre-trained diagnostic model with two stages has a\nbetter performance in break location and size diagnostic capability with an\nimprovement of 41.62% and 80.86% in the metrics respectively, compared to the\ndiagnostic model with end-to-end model structure.",

    "abstract": "Disruption prediction has made rapid progress in recent years, especially in\nmachine learning (ML)-based methods. Understanding why a predictor makes a\ncertain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy for future\ntokamak disruption predictors. The purpose of most disruption predictors is\naccuracy or cross-machine capability. However, if a disruption prediction model\ncan be interpreted, it can tell why certain samples are classified as\ndisruption precursors. This allows us to tell the types of incoming disruption\nand gives us insight into the mechanism of disruption. This paper designs a\ndisruption predictor called Interpretable Disruption Predictor based On\nPhysics-guided feature extraction (IDP-PGFE) on J-TEXT. The prediction\nperformance of the model is effectively improved by extracting physics-guided\nfeatures. A high-performance model is required to ensure the validity of the\ninterpretation results. The interpretability study of IDP-PGFE provides an\nunderstanding of J-TEXT disruption and is generally consistent with existing\ncomprehension of disruption. IDP-PGFE has been applied to the disruption due to\ncontinuously increasing density towards density limit experiments on J-TEXT.\nThe time evolution of the PGFE features contribution demonstrates that the\napplication of ECRH triggers radiation-caused disruption, which lowers the\ndensity at disruption. While the application of RMP indeed raises the density\nlimit in J-TEXT. The interpretability study guides intuition on the physical\nmechanisms of density limit disruption that RMPs affect not only the MHD\ninstabilities but also the radiation profile, which delays density limit\ndisruption.",

Validation was performed in an independent test set (n=20). In a\ncompletely blinded evaluation, 3 clinical experts rated the quality of deep\nlearning autosegmentations in a head-to-head comparison with expert-created\ncontours. For a subgroup of 10 cases, intraobserver variability was compared to\ndeep learning autosegmentation performance. The effect of autocontour\nconsistency with CT slice plane orientation on geometric accuracy and expert\nrating was investigated.\nResults: Mean blinded expert rating per level was significantly better for\ndeep learning segmentations with CT slice plane adjustment than for\nexpert-created contours (81.0 vs. 79.6, p<0.001), but deep learning\nsegmentations without slice plane adjustment were rated significantly worse\nthan expert-created contours (77.2 vs. 79.6, p<0.001). Geometric accuracy of\ndeep learning segmentations was non-different from intraobserver variability\n(mean Dice per level, 0.78 vs. 0.77, p=0.064) with variance in accuracy between\nlevels being improved (p<0.001). Clinical significance of contour consistency\nwith CT slice plane orientation was not represented by geometric accuracy\nmetrics (Dice, 0.78 vs. 0.78, p=0.572)\nConclusions: We show that a nnU-net 3D-fullres/2D-ensemble model can be used\nfor highly accurate autodelineation of HN_LNL using only a limited training\ndataset that is ideally suited for large-scale standardized autodelineation of\nHN_LNL in the research setting.

Many imaging modalities can be used as\naiding tools to detect liver tumors. Computed tomography (CT) is the most used\nimaging modality for soft tissue organs such as the liver.

The smoothness is implicitly embedded in the solution which results\nin a physically plausible deformation field. Secondly, it guarantees\ndiffeomorphism through explicit constraints applied to the transformation\nJacobian determinant to keep it positive. Finally, it is suitable for cardiac\ndata processing, since the nature of this parameterization is to define the\ndeformation field in terms of the radial and rotational components. The\neffectiveness of the algorithm is investigated by evaluating the proposed\nmethod on three different data sets including 2D and 3D cardiac MRI scans.

    "title": "Neural Network Approximation of Lipschitz Functions in High Dimensions  with Applications to Inverse Problems",
    "abstract": "The remarkable successes of neural networks in a huge variety of inverse\nproblems have fueled their adoption in disciplines ranging from medical imaging\nto seismic analysis over the past decade. However, the high dimensionality of\nsuch inverse problems has simultaneously left current theory, which predicts\nthat networks should scale exponentially in the dimension of the problem,\nunable to explain why the seemingly small networks used in these settings work\nas well as they do in practice. To reduce this gap between theory and practice,\na general method for bounding the complexity required for a neural network to\napproximate a Lipschitz function on a high-dimensional set with a\nlow-complexity structure is provided herein. The approach is based on the\nobservation that the existence of a linear Johnson-Lindenstrauss embedding\n$\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times D}$ of a given high-dimensional set\n$\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^D$ into a low dimensional cube $[-M,M]^d$\nimplies that for any Lipschitz function $f : \\mathcal{S}\\to \\mathbb{R}^p$,\nthere exists a Lipschitz function $g : [-M,M]^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^p$ such that\n$g(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}) = f(\\mathbf{x})$ for all $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{S}$.\nHence, if one has a neural network which approximates $g : [-M,M]^d \\to\n\\mathbb{R}^p$, then a layer can be added which implements the JL embedding\n$\\mathbf{A}$ to obtain a neural network which approximates $f : \\mathcal{S} \\to\n\\mathbb{R}^p$. By pairing JL embedding results along with results on\napproximation of Lipschitz functions by neural networks, one then obtains\nresults which bound the complexity required for a neural network to approximate\nLipschitz functions on high dimensional sets. The end result is a general\ntheoretical framework which can then be used to better explain the observed\nempirical successes of smaller networks in a wider variety of inverse problems\nthan current theory allows.",

    "abstract": "Since COVID-19 vaccines became available, no studies have quantified how\ndifferent disaster evacuation strategies can mitigate pandemic risks in\nshelters. Therefore, we applied an age-structured epidemiological model, known\nas the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, to investigate to\nwhat extent different vaccine uptake levels and the Diversion protocol\nimplemented in Taiwan decrease infections and delay pandemic peak occurrences.\nTaiwan's Diversion protocol involves diverting those in self-quarantine due to\nexposure, thus preventing them from mingling with the general public at a\ncongregate shelter. The Diversion protocol, combined with sufficient vaccine\nuptake, can decrease the maximum number of infections and delay outbreaks\nrelative to scenarios without such strategies. When the diversion of all\nexposed people is not possible, or vaccine uptake is insufficient, the\nDiversion protocol is still valuable. Furthermore, a group of evacuees that\nconsists primarily of a young adult population tends to experience pandemic\npeak occurrences sooner and have up to 180% more infections than does a\nmajority elderly group when the Diversion protocol is implemented. However,\nwhen the Diversion protocol is not enforced, the majority elderly group suffers\nfrom up to 20% more severe cases than the majority young adult group.",

According to clinical\nexperience, if this problem is detected and treated early, there can be a high\nchance of survival for the patient. One task that helps diagnose prostate\ncancer is prostate segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging. Manual\nsegmentation performed by clinical experts has its drawbacks such as: the high\ntime and concentration required from observers; and inter- and intra-observer\nvariability. This is why in recent years automatic approaches to segment a\nprostate based on convolutional neural networks have emerged. Many of them have\nnovel proposed architectures. In this paper I make an exhaustive study of\nseveral deep learning models by adjusting them to the task of prostate\nprediction. I do not use novel architectures, but focus my work more on how to\ntrain the networks. My approach is based on a ResNext101 3D encoder and a\nUnet3D decoder. I provide a study of the importance of resolutions in\nresampling data, something that no one else has done before.",

    "title": "Deformable Image Registration using Unsupervised Deep Learning for  CBCT-guided Abdominal Radiotherapy",
    "abstract": "CBCTs in image-guided radiotherapy provide crucial anatomy information for\npatient setup and plan evaluation. Longitudinal CBCT image registration could\nquantify the inter-fractional anatomic changes. The purpose of this study is to\npropose an unsupervised deep learning based CBCT-CBCT deformable image\nregistration. The proposed deformable registration workflow consists of\ntraining and inference stages that share the same feed-forward path through a\nspatial transformation-based network (STN). The STN consists of a global\ngenerative adversarial network (GlobalGAN) and a local GAN (LocalGAN) to\npredict the coarse- and fine-scale motions, respectively. The network was\ntrained by minimizing the image similarity loss and the deformable vector field\n(DVF) regularization loss without the supervision of ground truth DVFs. During\nthe inference stage, patches of local DVF were predicted by the trained\nLocalGAN and fused to form a whole-image DVF. The local whole-image DVF was\nsubsequently combined with the GlobalGAN generated DVF to obtain final DVF. The\nproposed method was evaluated using 100 fractional CBCTs from 20 abdominal\ncancer patients in the experiments and 105 fractional CBCTs from a cohort of 21\ndifferent abdominal cancer patients in a holdout test. Qualitatively, the\nregistration results show great alignment between the deformed CBCT images and\nthe target CBCT image. Quantitatively, the average target registration error\n(TRE) calculated on the fiducial markers and manually identified landmarks was\n1.91+-1.11 mm. The average mean absolute error (MAE), normalized cross\ncorrelation (NCC) between the deformed CBCT and target CBCT were 33.42+-7.48\nHU, 0.94+-0.04, respectively. This promising registration method could provide\nfast and accurate longitudinal CBCT alignment to facilitate inter-fractional\nanatomic changes analysis and prediction.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation wireless networks will leverage the spectrum above 100 GHz to\nenable ultra-high data rate communications over multi-GHz-wide bandwidths. The\npropagation environment at such high frequencies, however, introduces\nchallenges throughout the whole protocol stack design, from physical layer\nsignal processing to application design. Therefore, it is fundamental to\ndevelop a holistic understanding of the channel propagation and fading\ncharacteristics over realistic deployment scenarios and ultra-wide bands. In\nthis paper, we conduct an extensive measurement campaign to evaluate the impact\nof weather conditions on a wireless link in the 130-150 GHz band through a\nchannel sounding campaign with clear weather, rain, and snow in a typical urban\nbackhaul scenario. We present a novel channel sounder design that captures\nsignals with -82 dBm sensitivity and 20 GHz of bandwidth. We analyze link\nbudget, capacity, as well as channel parameters such as the delay spread and\nthe K-factor. Our experimental results indicate that in the considered context\nthe adverse weather does not interrupt the link, but introduces some additional\nconstraints (e.g., high delay spread and increase in path loss in snow\nconditions) that need to be accounted for in the design of reliable Sixth\nGeneration (6G) communication links above 100 GHz.",

    "abstract": "We study a constructive algorithm that approximates Gateaux derivatives for\nstatistical functionals by finite-differencing, with a focus on causal\ninference functionals. We consider the case where probability distributions are\nnot known a priori but also need to be estimated from data. These estimated\ndistributions lead to empirical Gateaux derivatives, and we study the\nrelationships between empirical, numerical, and analytical Gateaux derivatives.\nStarting with a case study of counterfactual mean estimation, we instantiate\nthe exact relationship between finite-differences and the analytical Gateaux\nderivative. We then derive requirements on the rates of numerical approximation\nin perturbation and smoothing that preserve the statistical benefits of\none-step adjustments, such as rate-double-robustness. We then study more\ncomplicated functionals such as dynamic treatment regimes and the\nlinear-programming formulation for policy optimization in infinite-horizon\nMarkov decision processes. The newfound ability to approximate bias adjustments\nin the presence of arbitrary constraints illustrates the usefulness of\nconstructive approaches for Gateaux derivatives. We also find that the\nstatistical structure of the functional (rate-double robustness) can permit\nless conservative rates of finite-difference approximation. This property,\nhowever, can be specific to particular functionals, e.g. it occurs for the\ncounterfactual mean but not the infinite-horizon MDP policy value.",

A\nkey issue is that the garnet structure has a large primitive unit cell,\nrequiring an enormous amount of computational resources. To perform a\ncomprehensive search of the complete chemical space for new garnets,we combine\nrecent progress in graph neural networks with high-throughput calculations. We\napply the machine learning model to identify the potential (meta-)stable garnet\nsystems before systematic density-functional calculations to validate the\npredictions. In this way, we discover more than 600 ternary garnets with\ndistances to the convex hull below 100~meV/atom with a variety of physical and\nchemical properties. This includes sulfide, nitride and halide garnets. For\nthese, we analyze the electronic structure and discuss the connection between\nthe value of the electronic band gap and charge balance.",

We present a simple method of computing secure key rates\nfor any practical implementation of discrete-variable QKD (which can also apply\nto measurement-device-independent QKD), initially in the single-qubit regime,\nand we rigorously prove its unconditional security against any possible attack.\nWe hope our method becomes one of the standard tools used for analyzing,\nbenchmarking, and standardizing all practical realizations of QKD.",
