    "title": "Gibbs Phenomenon Suppression in PDE-Based Statistical Spatio-Temporal  Models",
    "abstract": "A class of physics-informed spatio-temporal models has recently been proposed\nfor modeling spatio-temporal processes governed by advection-diffusion\nequations. The central idea is to approximate the process by a truncated\nFourier series and let the governing physics determine the dynamics of the\nspectral coefficients. However, because many spatio-temporal processes in real\napplications are non-periodic with boundary discontinuities, the well-known\nGibbs phenomenon and ripple artifact almost always exist in the outputs\ngenerated by such models due to truncation of the Fourier series. Hence, the\nkey contribution of this paper is to propose a physics-informed spatio-temporal\nmodeling approach that significantly suppresses the Gibbs phenomenon when\nmodeling spatio-temporal advection-diffusion processes. The proposed approach\nstarts with a data flipping procedure for the process respectively along the\nhorizontal and vertical directions (as if we were unfolding a piece of paper\nthat has been folded twice along the two directions). Because the flipped\nprocess becomes spatially periodic and has a complete waveform without any\nboundary discontinuities, the Gibbs phenomenon disappears even if the Fourier\nseries is truncated. Then, for the flipped process and given the Partial\nDifferential Equation (PDE) that governs the process, this paper extends an\nexisting PDE-based spatio-temporal model by obtaining the new temporal dynamics\nof the spectral coefficients, while maintaining the physical interpretation of\nthe flipped process. Numerical investigations based on a real dataset have been\nperformed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. It is found\nthat the proposed approach effectively suppresses the Gibbs Phenomenon and\nsignificantly reduces the ripple artifact in modeling spatio-temporal\nadvection-diffusion processes.

    "abstract": "Early detection of anxiety disorders is essential to reduce the suffering of\npeople with mental disorders and to improve treatment outcomes. Anxiety\nscreening based on the mHealth platform is of particular practical value in\nimproving screening efficiency and reducing screening costs. In practice,\ndifferences in mobile devices in subjects' physical and mental evaluations and\nthe problems faced with uneven data quality and small sample sizes of data in\nthe real world have made existing methods ineffective. Therefore, we propose a\nframework based on spatiotemporal feature fusion for detecting anxiety\nnonintrusively. To reduce the impact of uneven data quality, we constructed a\nfeature extraction network based on \"3DCNN+LSTM\" and fused spatiotemporal\nfeatures of facial behavior and noncontact physiology. Moreover, we designed a\nsimilarity assessment strategy to solve the problem that the small sample size\nof data leads to a decline in model accuracy. Our framework was validated with\nour crew dataset from the real world and two public datasets, UBFC-PHYS and\nSWELL-KW. The experimental results show that the overall performance of our\nframework was better than that of the state-of-the-art comparison methods.",

Our results substantially improve upon all\nrecently-proposed online caching policies, which, being unable to exploit the\noracle predictions, offer only $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. In this pursuit, we\ndesign, to the best of our knowledge, the first comprehensive optimistic\nFollow-the-Perturbed leader policy, which generalizes beyond the caching\nproblem. We also study the problem of caching files with different sizes and\nthe bipartite network caching problem. Finally, we evaluate the efficacy of the\nproposed policies through extensive numerical experiments using real-world\ntraces.",

    "abstract": "Few prior 6D pose estimation methods use a backbone network to extract\nfeatures from RGB and depth images, and Uni6D is the pioneer to do so. We find\nthat primary causes of the performance limitation in Uni6D are Instance-Outside\nand Instance-Inside noise. Uni6D inevitably introduces Instance-Outside noise\nfrom background pixels in the receptive field due to its inherently\nstraightforward pipeline design and ignores the Instance-Inside noise in the\ninput depth data. In this work, we propose a two-step denoising method to\nhandle aforementioned noise in Uni6D. In the first step, an instance\nsegmentation network is used to crop and mask the instance to remove noise from\nnon-instance regions. In the second step, a lightweight depth denoising module\nis proposed to calibrate the depth feature before feeding it into the pose\nregression network. Extensive experiments show that our method called Uni6Dv2\nis able to eliminate the noise effectively and robustly, outperforming Uni6D\nwithout sacrificing too much inference efficiency.

Therefore,\ncomputer vision techniques can be viable tools for automatic accident\ndetection. This paper presents a new efficient framework for accident detection\nat intersections for traffic surveillance applications. The proposed framework\nconsists of three hierarchical steps, including efficient and accurate object\ndetection based on the state-of-the-art YOLOv4 method, object tracking based on\nKalman filter coupled with the Hungarian algorithm for association, and\naccident detection by trajectory conflict analysis. A new cost function is\napplied for object association to accommodate for occlusion, overlapping\nobjects, and shape changes in the object tracking step. The object trajectories\nare analyzed in terms of velocity, angle, and distance in order to detect\ndifferent types of trajectory conflicts including vehicle-to-vehicle,\nvehicle-to-pedestrian, and vehicle-to-bicycle. Experimental results using real\ntraffic video data show the feasibility of the proposed method in real-time\napplications of traffic surveillance. In particular, trajectory conflicts,\nincluding near-accidents and accidents occurring at urban intersections are\ndetected with a low false alarm rate and a high detection rate. The robustness\nof the proposed framework is evaluated using video sequences collected from\nYouTube with diverse illumination conditions. The dataset is publicly available\nat: this http URL",

    "abstract": "Online social networks facilitate the diffusion of misinformation. Some\ntheorists construe the problem of misinformation as a problem of knowledge,\nhence of ignorance. This assumption leads to solutions in which misinformation\n(false belief) is resisted by good information (true belief). We argue that\ninformation is better understood as gossip. We believe that gossip spreads as\npart of an economy of social capital that has a specific discursive grammar\nthat mimics ordinary human gossip. But there are some critical differences.\nThese differences have immense and divisive social and political effects. If we\nshift our focus from the truth or falsity of information, and instead focus on\nthe social dynamics of gossip we can more effectively respond to the challenges\nand dangers of online social networks.\nOur argument has three parts. (1) We briefly critique epistemological and\ntruth-centered accounts of misinformation. (2) We describe a basic discursive\ngrammar of gossip as a social practice. (3) We, then, match the properties of\nonline information with this discursive grammar of gossip. While gossip has a\nparticular discursive form, its online modes involve a number of unique social\nfeatures that will have immense and divisive social and political effects. Our\ngoal is not to replace current accounts of information diffusion but to augment\nthese accounts with a descriptive model of gossip.

    "abstract": "Ethereum and its standardized token interface have formed decentralized\nfinance (DeFi), an open financial system based on blockchain smart contracts.\nThe DeFi ecosystem has become richer with the introduction of DeFi\ncomposability projects, such as Lido finance and Curve finance. DeFi\ncomposability denotes the concatenation of DeFi services in which each DeFi\nservice locks assets as collateral and gives another asset as liquidity of\nlocked assets to providers. Providers use the tokens given for other\nconcatenated DeFi services, such as lending, decentralized exchanges (DEXs),\nand derivatives. The DeFi ecosystem uses ERC-20 tokens which can represent the\nvalue of an asset. ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are not widely adopted in\nDeFi, since they represent rights to an asset and are not considered\nappropriate for valuation. In this paper, we propose a new concept, perpetual\ncontract NFT, which exploits perpetual future contracts in the cryptocurrency\nderivatives market. Unlike futures contracts in a traditional derivatives\nmarket, in the cryptocurrency derivatives market, most futures contracts are\nperpetual. In addition, the value of futures contract is backed by collateral.\nTherefore, if we mint the rights to perpetual contracts as NFT, we can use the\nperpetual contract NFT as collateral for DeFi composability. To validate our\nproposal and its profitability, we experiment with the position NFT of Uniswap\nv3. Through validation, we show that our concept works in real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Question answering over temporal knowledge graphs (TKGQA) has recently found\nincreasing interest. TKGQA requires temporal reasoning techniques to extract\nthe relevant information from temporal knowledge bases. The only existing TKGQA\ndataset, i.e., CronQuestions, consists of temporal questions based on the facts\nfrom a fixed time period, where a temporal knowledge graph (TKG) spanning the\nsame period can be fully used for answer inference, allowing the TKGQA models\nto use even the future knowledge to answer the questions based on the past\nfacts. In real-world scenarios, however, it is also common that given the\nknowledge until now, we wish the TKGQA systems to answer the questions asking\nabout the future. As humans constantly seek plans for the future, building\nTKGQA systems for answering such forecasting questions is important.\nNevertheless, this has still been unexplored in previous research. In this\npaper, we propose a novel task: forecasting question answering over temporal\nknowledge graphs. We also propose a large-scale TKGQA benchmark dataset, i.e.,\nForecastTKGQuestions, for this task. It includes three types of questions,\ni.e., entity prediction, yes-no, and fact reasoning questions. For every\nforecasting question in our dataset, QA models can only have access to the TKG\ninformation before the timestamp annotated in the given question for answer\ninference. We find that the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods perform poorly on\nforecasting questions, and they are unable to answer yes-no questions and fact\nreasoning questions. To this end, we propose ForecastTKGQA, a TKGQA model that\nemploys a TKG forecasting module for future inference, to answer all three\ntypes of questions. Experimental results show that ForecastTKGQA outperforms\nrecent TKGQA methods on the entity prediction questions, and it also shows\ngreat effectiveness in answering the other two types of questions.",

This problem is closely related to chromatic correlation\nclustering and various generalized multiway cut problems. We first of all\nprovide a $\\min\\{2 - 2/k, 2-2/(r+1)\\}$-approximation by rounding a natural\nlinear programming relaxation, where $r$ is the maximum hyperedge size and $k$\nis the number of colors.

When $r$ is\nlarge, our approximation matches a known $2(1-1/k)$-approximation based on\nreducing to node-weighted multiway cut and rounding a different linear program.\nThe exact relationship between the two linear programs was not previously\nknown; we prove that the canonical relaxation is always at least as tight as\nthe node-weighted multiway cut relaxation, and can be strictly tighter.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in the field of semantic\nsegmentation. However, one remaining challenging problem is that segmentation\nmodels do not generalize to unseen domains. To overcome this problem, one\neither has to label lots of data covering the whole variety of domains, which\nis often infeasible in practice, or apply unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA),\nonly requiring labeled source data. In this work, we focus on UDA and\nadditionally address the case of adapting not only to a single domain, but to a\nsequence of target domains. This requires mechanisms preventing the model from\nforgetting its previously learned knowledge. To adapt a segmentation model to a\ntarget domain, we follow the idea of utilizing light-weight style transfer to\nconvert the style of labeled source images into the style of the target domain,\nwhile retaining the source content. To mitigate the distributional shift\nbetween the source and the target domain, the model is fine-tuned on the\ntransferred source images in a second step. Existing light-weight style\ntransfer approaches relying on adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) or\nFourier transformation still lack performance and do not substantially improve\nupon common data augmentation, such as color jittering. The reason for this is\nthat these methods do not focus on region- or class-specific differences, but\nmainly capture the most salient style. Therefore, we propose a simple and\nlight-weight framework that incorporates two class-conditional AdaIN layers. To\nextract the class-specific target moments needed for the transfer layers, we\nuse unfiltered pseudo-labels, which we show to be an effective approximation\ncompared to real labels. We extensively validate our approach (CACE) on a\nsynthetic sequence and further propose a challenging sequence consisting of\nreal domains. CACE outperforms existing methods visually and quantitatively.",

    "abstract": "The average coflow completion time (CCT) is the standard performance metric\nin coflow scheduling. However, standard CCT minimization may introduce\nunfairness between the data transfer phase of different computing jobs. Thus,\nwhile progress guarantees have been introduced in the literature to mitigate\nthis fairness issue, the trade-off between fairness and efficiency of data\ntransfer is hard to control. This paper introduces a fairness framework for\ncoflow scheduling based on the concept of slowdown, i.e., the performance loss\nof a coflow compared to isolation. By controlling the slowdown it is possible\nto enforce a target coflow progress while minimizing the average CCT. In the\nproposed framework, the minimum slowdown for a batch of coflows can be\ndetermined in polynomial time. By showing the equivalence with Gaussian\nelimination, slowdown constraints are introduced into primal-dual iterations of\nthe CoFair algorithm. The algorithm extends the class of the sigma-order\nschedulers to solve the fair coflow scheduling problem in polynomial time. It\nprovides a 4-approximation of the average CCT w.r.t. an optimal scheduler.\nExtensive numerical results demonstrate that this approach can trade off\naverage CCT for slowdown more efficiently than existing state of the art\nschedulers.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a consolidated grid impact analysis design and\ncorresponding mitigation strategies for heavy-duty electric vehicle (EV)\ncharging stations. The charging load of heavy-duty charging station can reach\nseveral megawatts, which could induce adverse impacts on the distribution grid\nif not effectively mitigated. To analyze the impacts and provide corresponding\nsolutions, we select four representative distribution systems - including both\nsingle-feeder cases and a multi-feeder case - and design thorough test metrics\nfor the impact analysis. The charging load profiles used in the analysis are\nderived from realistic conventional heavy-duty vehicle travel data. Based on\nthe analysis results, charging stations are placed at three different\nrepresentative locations in each distribution system: best, good, and worst\nlocations. Mitigation strategies using a combination of smart charger\nfunctionality, on-site photovoltaic (PV) generation, and on-site energy storage\n(ES) are proposed and tested. A sizing method is also proposed to find the\noptimal PV-ES-charger capacity that minimizes the capital cost.",

In contrast to\nprior work, we examine a three-player game architecture in which all players\nexplicitly interact with each other. Prior work analyzes games in which two of\nthree agents interact with only one other player, constituting dual two-player\ngames. We explore three-player game training dynamics using an extended version\nof a simplified bilinear smooth game, called a simplified trilinear smooth\ngame. We find that trilinear games do not converge on the Nash equilibrium in\nmost cases, rather converging on a fixed point which is optimal for two\nplayers, but not for the third. Further, we explore how the order of the\nupdates influences convergence. In addition to alternating and simultaneous\nupdates, we explore a new update order--maximizer-first--which is only possible\nin a three-player game. We find that three-player games can converge on a Nash\nequilibrium using maximizer-first updates. Finally, we experiment with\ndiffering momentum values for each player in a trilinear smooth game under all\nthree update orders and show that maximizer-first updates achieve more optimal\nresults in a larger set of player-specific momentum value triads than other\nupdate orders.",

In this\npaper, by second order central difference scheme and L1 nonstandard finite\ndifference scheme, a discrete counterpart of time-fractional reaction-diffusion\nepidemic model with generalized incidence rate is considered. More importantly,\nthe main idea in choosing an nonstandard finite difference scheme is to obtain\nunconditionally positivity in the proposed system, which leads to the proposal\nof the discrete epidemic model with time delay. Furthermore, the global\nproperties of the proposed discrete system are studied, including the global\nboundedness of positive solutions, the existence and the global stability of\nequilibrium points, which are consistent with the corresponding continuous\nsystems. Meanwhile, it shows that L1 nonstandard finite difference scheme and\nsecond order central difference scheme can keep the properties of the\ncorresponding continuous system well. It is worth noting that, different from\ndiscrete epidemic model with integer-order, the memory Lyapunov function is\nconstructed in this paper, which depends on the previous historical information\nof the proposed system.

    "title": "Finding Point with Image: An End-to-End Benchmark for Vision-based UAV  Localization",
    "abstract": "In the past, image retrieval was the mainstream solution for cross-view\ngeolocation and UAV visual localization tasks. In a nutshell, the way of image\nretrieval is to obtain the final required information, such as GPS, through a\ntransitional perspective. However, the way of image retrieval is not completely\nend-to-end. And there are some redundant operations such as the need to prepare\nthe feature library in advance, and the sampling interval problem of the\ngallery construction, which make it difficult to implement large-scale\napplications. In this article we propose an end-to-end positioning scheme,\nFinding Point with Image (FPI), which aims to directly find the corresponding\nlocation in the image of source B (satellite-view) through the image of source\nA (drone-view). To verify the feasibility of our framework, we construct a new\ndataset (UL14), which is designed to solve the UAV visual self-localization\ntask. At the same time, we also build a transformer-based baseline to achieve\nend-to-end training. In addition, the previous evaluation methods are no longer\napplicable under the framework of FPI. Thus, Metre-level Accuracy (MA) and\nRelative Distance Score (RDS) are proposed to evaluate the accuracy of UAV\nlocalization. At the same time, we preliminarily compare FPI and image\nretrieval method, and the structure of FPI achieves better performance in both\nspeed and efficiency. In particular, the task of FPI remains great challenges\ndue to the large differences between different views and the drastic spatial\nscale transformation.",

    "title": "On the Limitations of Continual Learning for Malware Classification",
    "abstract": "Malicious software (malware) classification offers a unique challenge for\ncontinual learning (CL) regimes due to the volume of new samples received on a\ndaily basis and the evolution of malware to exploit new vulnerabilities. On a\ntypical day, antivirus vendors receive hundreds of thousands of unique pieces\nof software, both malicious and benign, and over the course of the lifetime of\na malware classifier, more than a billion samples can easily accumulate. Given\nthe scale of the problem, sequential training using continual learning\ntechniques could provide substantial benefits in reducing training and storage\noverhead. To date, however, there has been no exploration of CL applied to\nmalware classification tasks. In this paper, we study 11 CL techniques applied\nto three malware tasks covering common incremental learning scenarios,\nincluding task, class, and domain incremental learning (IL). Specifically,\nusing two realistic, large-scale malware datasets, we evaluate the performance\nof the CL methods on both binary malware classification (Domain-IL) and\nmulti-class malware family classification (Task-IL and Class-IL) tasks. To our\nsurprise, continual learning methods significantly underperformed naive Joint\nreplay of the training data in nearly all settings -- in some cases reducing\naccuracy by more than 70 percentage points. A simple approach of selectively\nreplaying 20% of the stored data achieves better performance, with 50% of the\ntraining time compared to Joint replay. Finally, we discuss potential reasons\nfor the unexpectedly poor performance of the CL techniques, with the hope that\nit spurs further research on developing techniques that are more effective in\nthe malware classification domain.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of modern robotics, autonomous agents are now capable of\nhosting sophisticated algorithms, which enables them to make intelligent\ndecisions. But developing and testing such algorithms directly in real-world\nsystems is tedious and may result in the wastage of valuable resources.\nEspecially for heterogeneous multi-agent systems in battlefield environments\nwhere communication is critical in determining the system's behavior and\nusability. Due to the necessity of simulators of separate paradigms\n(co-simulation) to simulate such scenarios before deploying, synchronization\nbetween those simulators is vital. Existing works aimed at resolving this issue\nfall short of addressing diversity among deployed agents. In this work, we\npropose \\textit{SynchroSim}, an integrated co-simulation middleware to simulate\na heterogeneous multi-robot system. Here we propose a velocity\ndifference-driven adjustable window size approach with a view to reducing\npacket loss probability. It takes into account the respective velocities of\ndeployed agents to calculate a suitable window size before transmitting data\nbetween them. We consider our algorithm-specific simulator agnostic but for the\nsake of implementation results, we have used Gazebo as a Physics simulator and\nNS-3 as a network simulator. Also, we design our algorithm considering the\nPerception-Action loop inside a closed communication channel, which is one of\nthe essential factors in a contested scenario with the requirement of high\nfidelity in terms of data transmission. We validate our approach empirically at\nboth the simulation and system level for both line-of-sight (LOS) and\nnon-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Our approach achieves a noticeable\nimprovement in terms of reducing packet loss probability ($\\approx$11\\%), and\naverage packet delay ($\\approx$10\\%) compared to the fixed window size-based\nsynchronization approach.",

    "abstract": "The potential advantages of intelligent wireless communications with\nmillimeter wave (mmWave) and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) are\nall based on the availability of instantaneous channel state information (CSI)\nat the base station (BS). However, in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems,\nno existence of channel reciprocity leads to the difficult acquisition of\naccurate CSI at the BS. In recent years, many researchers explored effective\narchitectures based on deep learning (DL) to solve this problem and proved the\nsuccess of DL-based solutions. However, existing schemes focused on the\nacquisition of complete CSI while ignoring the beamforming and precoding\noperations. In this paper, we propose an intelligent channel feedback\narchitecture designed for beamforming based on attention mechanism and eigen\nfeatures. That is, we design an eigenmatrix and eigenvector feedback neural\nnetwork, called EMEVNet. The key idea of EMEVNet is to extract and feedback\neffective information meeting the requirements of beamforming and precoding\noperations at the BS. With the help of the attention mechanism, the proposed\nEMEVNet can be considered as a dual channel auto-encoder, which is able to\njointly encode the eigenmatrix and eigenvector into codewords. Hence, the\nEMEVNet consists of an encoder deployed at the user and the decoder at the BS.\nEach user first utilizes singular value decomposition (SVD) transformation to\nextract the eigen features from CSI, and then selects an appropriate encoder\nfor a specific channel to generate feedback codewords.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly being used to automate\nthe segmentation of brain structures in magnetic resonance (MR) images for\nresearch studies. In other applications, CNN models have been shown to exhibit\nbias against certain demographic groups when they are under-represented in the\ntraining sets. In this work, we investigate whether CNN models for brain MR\nsegmentation have the potential to contain sex or race bias when trained with\nimbalanced training sets. We train multiple instances of the FastSurferCNN\nmodel using different levels of sex imbalance in white subjects. We evaluate\nthe performance of these models separately for white male and white female test\nsets to assess sex bias, and furthermore evaluate them on black male and black\nfemale test sets to assess potential racial bias. We find significant sex and\nrace bias effects in segmentation model performance. The biases have a strong\nspatial component, with some brain regions exhibiting much stronger bias than\nothers. Overall, our results suggest that race bias is more significant than\nsex bias. Our study demonstrates the importance of considering race and sex\nbalance when forming training sets for CNN-based brain MR segmentation, to\navoid maintaining or even exacerbating existing health inequalities through\nbiased research study findings.",

    "abstract": "Learning time-series representations when only unlabeled data or few labeled\nsamples are available can be a challenging task. Recently, contrastive\nself-supervised learning has shown great improvement in extracting useful\nrepresentations from unlabeled data via contrasting different augmented views\nof data. In this work, we propose a novel Time-Series representation learning\nframework via Temporal and Contextual Contrasting (TS-TCC) that learns\nrepresentations from unlabeled data with contrastive learning. Specifically, we\npropose time-series specific weak and strong augmentations and use their views\nto learn robust temporal relations in the proposed temporal contrasting module,\nbesides learning discriminative representations by our proposed contextual\ncontrasting module. Additionally, we conduct a systematic study of time-series\ndata augmentation selection, which is a key part of contrastive learning. We\nalso extend TS-TCC to the semi-supervised learning settings and propose a\nClass-Aware TS-TCC (CA-TCC) that benefits from the available few labeled data\nto further improve representations learned by TS-TCC. Specifically, we leverage\nrobust pseudo labels produced by TS-TCC to realize class-aware contrastive\nloss. Extensive experiments show that the linear evaluation of the features\nlearned by our proposed framework performs comparably with the fully supervised\ntraining. Additionally, our framework shows high efficiency in few labeled data\nand transfer learning scenarios. The code is publicly available at\n\\url{https://github.com/emadeldeen24/TS-TCC}.",

Positive\ninterventions, controlled signals that add attention to the opinion ecosystem\nwith the aim of boosting certain opinions, are one such pathway for mitigation.\nThis work proposes a platform to test the effectiveness of positive\ninterventions, through the Opinion Market Model (OMM), a two-tier model of the\nonline opinion ecosystem jointly accounting for both inter-opinion interactions\nand the role of positive interventions.

Despite the importance of log data, the practice of logging still\nsuffers from the lack of common guidelines and best practices. Recent studies\ninvestigated logging in C/C++ and Java open-source systems. In this paper, we\ncomplement these studies by conducting the first empirical study on logging\npractices in the Linux kernel, one of the most elaborate open-source\ndevelopment projects in the computer industry. We analyze 22 Linux releases\nwith a focus on three main aspects: the pervasiveness of logging in Linux, the\ntypes of changes made to logging statements, and the rationale behind these\nchanges. Our findings show that logging code accounts for 3.73% of the total\nsource code in the Linux kernel, distributed across 72.36% of Linux files. We\nalso found that the distribution of logging statements across Linux subsystems\nand their components vary significantly with no apparent reasons, suggesting\nthat developers use different criteria when logging. In addition, we observed a\nslow decrease in the use of logging-reduction of 9.27% between versions v4.3\nand v5.3. The majority of changes in logging code are made to fix language\nissues, modify log levels, and upgrade logging code to use new logging\nlibraries, with the overall goal of improving the precision and consistency of\nthe log output. Many recommendations are derived from our findings such as the\nuse of static analysis tools to detect log-related issues, the adoption of\ncommon writing styles to improve the quality of log messages, the development\nof conventions to guide developers when selecting log levels, the establishment\nof review sessions to review logging code, and so on.

To address this \"global-to-local\" problem, we\npresent a general framework CAMA to generate adversarial examples by\nmanipulating graph structure and node features in a hierarchical style.\nSpecifically, we make use of Graph Class Activation Mapping and its variant to\nproduce node-level importance corresponding to the graph classification task.\nThen through a heuristic design of algorithms, we can perform both feature and\nstructure attacks under unnoticeable perturbation budgets with the help of both\nnode-level and subgraph-level importance.

To assist these developers,\nmaintainers have started to release their libraries to multiple technologies,\ni.e., a cross-ecosystem library. Our goal is to explore the extent to which\nthese cross-ecosystem libraries are intertwined between ecosystems. We perform\na large-scale empirical study of 1.1 million libraries from five different\nsoftware ecosystems, i.e., PyPI for Python, CRAN for R, Maven for Java,\nRubyGems for Ruby, and NPM for JavaScript to identify 4,146 GitHub projects\nthat release libraries to these five ecosystems.

We also find that a cross-ecosystem library is\nwritten using multiple programming languages. Specifically, three (i.e., PyPI,\nCRAN, RubyGems) out of the five ecosystems has the majority of source code is\nwritten using languages not specific to that ecosystem. As ecosystems become\nintertwined, this opens up new avenues for research, such as whether or not\ncross-ecosystem libraries will solve the search for replacement libraries, or\nhow these libraries fit within each ecosystem just to name a few.",

    "abstract": "Structured pruning techniques have achieved great compression performance on\nconvolutional neural networks for image classification task. However, the\nmajority of existing methods are weight-oriented, and their pruning results may\nbe unsatisfactory when the original model is trained poorly. That is, a\nfully-trained model is required to provide useful weight information. This may\nbe time-consuming, and the pruning results are sensitive to the updating\nprocess of model parameters. In this paper, we propose a metric named Average\nFilter Information Entropy (AFIE) to measure the importance of each filter. It\nis calculated by three major steps, i.e., low-rank decomposition of the\n\"input-output\" matrix of each convolutional layer, normalization of the\nobtained eigenvalues, and calculation of filter importance based on information\nentropy. By leveraging the proposed AFIE, the proposed framework is able to\nyield a stable importance evaluation of each filter no matter whether the\noriginal model is trained fully. We implement our AFIE based on AlexNet,\nVGG-16, and ResNet-50, and test them on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet,\nrespectively. The experimental results are encouraging. We surprisingly observe\nthat for our methods, even when the original model is only trained with one\nepoch, the importance evaluation of each filter keeps identical to the results\nwhen the model is fully-trained. This indicates that the proposed pruning\nstrategy can perform effectively at the beginning stage of the training process\nfor the original model.",

    "abstract": "Category-level pose estimation is a challenging problem due to intra-class\nshape variations. Recent methods deform pre-computed shape priors to map the\nobserved point cloud into the normalized object coordinate space and then\nretrieve the pose via post-processing, i.e., Umeyama's Algorithm. The\nshortcomings of this two-stage strategy lie in two aspects: 1) The surrogate\nsupervision on the intermediate results can not directly guide the learning of\npose, resulting in large pose error after post-processing. 2) The inference\nspeed is limited by the post-processing step. In this paper, to handle these\nshortcomings, we propose an end-to-end trainable network SSP-Pose for\ncategory-level pose estimation, which integrates shape priors into a direct\npose regression network. SSP-Pose stacks four individual branches on a shared\nfeature extractor, where two branches are designed to deform and match the\nprior model with the observed instance, and the other two branches are applied\nfor directly regressing the totally 9 degrees-of-freedom pose and performing\nsymmetry reconstruction and point-wise inlier mask prediction respectively.\nConsistency loss terms are then naturally exploited to align the outputs of\ndifferent branches and promote the performance. During inference, only the\ndirect pose regression branch is needed. In this manner, SSP-Pose not only\nlearns category-level pose-sensitive characteristics to boost performance but\nalso keeps a real-time inference speed. Moreover, we utilize the symmetry\ninformation of each category to guide the shape prior deformation, and propose\na novel symmetry-aware loss to mitigate the matching ambiguity. Extensive\nexperiments on public datasets demonstrate that SSP-Pose produces superior\nperformance compared with competitors with a real-time inference speed at about\n25Hz.",

Assigning specific names to entities (e.g. faces, scenes, or\nobjects) in video frames is a long-standing challenge. Commonly, this problem\nis addressed as a supervised learning objective by manually annotating faces\nwith entity labels. To bypass the annotation burden of this setup, several\nworks have investigated the problem by utilizing external knowledge sources\nsuch as movie databases. While effective, such approaches do not work when\ntask-specific knowledge sources are not provided and can only be applied to\nmovies and TV series. In this work, we take the problem a step further and\npropose to discover entities in videos from videos and corresponding captions\nor subtitles. We introduce a three-stage method where we (i) create bipartite\nentity-name graphs from frame-caption pairs, (ii) find visual entity\nagreements, and (iii) refine the entity assignment through entity-level\nprototype construction. To tackle this new problem, we outline two new\nbenchmarks SC-Friends and SC-BBT based on the Friends and Big Bang Theory TV\nseries. Experiments on the benchmarks demonstrate the ability of our approach\nto discover which named entity belongs to which face or scene, with an accuracy\nclose to a supervised oracle, just from the multimodal information present in\nvideos. Additionally, our qualitative examples show the potential challenges of\nself-contained discovery of any visual entity for future work. The code and the\ndata are available on GitHub.",

The proposed system model is built up considering one base\nstation (BS), one RIS, and two users. With the goal of minimizing the network\nenergy consumption, a joint framework to optimize the precoding vectors at the\nBS, common stream split, relaying device transmit power, the time slot\nallocation, and the passive beamforming at the RIS subject to the power budget\nconstraints at both the BS and the relaying node, the quality of service (QoS)\nconstraints at both users, and common stream rate constraint is proposed. The\nformulated problem is a non-convex optimization problem due to the high\ncoupling among the optimization variables. To tackle this challenge, an\nefficient algorithm is presented by invoking the alternating optimization\ntechnique, which decomposes the original problem into two sub-problems; namely,\nsub-problem-1 and sub-problem-2, which are alternatively solved. Specifically,\nsub-problem-1 is to jointly optimize the precoding vectors, common stream\nsplit, and relaying device power. Meanwhile, sub-problem-2 is to optimize the\nphase shift matrix at the RIS. In order to solve sub-problem-1, an efficient\nlow-complexity solution based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) is\nproposed. Meanwhile, and with the aid of difference-of-convex rank-one\nrepresentation and the SCA approach, an efficient solution for the phase shift\nmatrix at the RIS is obtained. The simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed RIS-assisted HD C-RSMA achieves a significant gain in minimizing the\ntotal energy consumption compared to the RIS-assisted RSMA scheme, RIS-assisted\nHD cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA), RIS-assisted NOMA, HD\nC-RSMA without RIS, and HD C-NOMA without RIS.",

In this work, we\npropose the ADAptive Nesterov momentum algorithm, Adan for short, to\neffectively speedup the training of deep neural networks. Adan first\nreformulates the vanilla Nesterov acceleration to develop a new Nesterov\nmomentum estimation (NME) method, which avoids the extra computation and memory\noverhead of computing gradient at the extrapolation point. Then Adan adopts NME\nto estimate the first- and second-order moments of the gradient in adaptive\ngradient algorithms for convergence acceleration. Besides, we prove that Adan\nfinds an $\\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point within\n$O(\\epsilon^{-3.5})$ stochastic gradient complexity on the nonconvex stochastic\nproblems (e.g., deep learning problems), matching the best-known lower bound.\nExtensive experimental results show that Adan surpasses the corresponding SoTA\noptimizers on both vision transformers (ViTs) and CNNs, and sets new SoTAs for\nmany popular networks, e.g., ResNet, ConvNext, ViT, Swin, MAE, LSTM,\nTransformer-XL, and BERT.

While this approach\ncan efficiently exploit the translation motion of the moving objects, it is\nsusceptible to other types of affine motion and object occlusion/deocclusion.\nRecently, deep learning has been used to model the high-level structure of\nhuman pose in specific actions from short videos and then generate virtual\nframes in future time by predicting the pose using a generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN). Therefore, modelling the high-level structure of human pose is\nable to exploit semantic correlation by predicting human actions and\ndetermining its trajectory.

However,\nthis limits applicability in real-world settings where datasets are high\ndimensional and, on top of that, sensitive attributes may be unknown. As a\nremedy, we propose a data-driven framework called Automatic Location of\nDisparities (ALD) which aims at locating disparities in machine learning. ALD\nmeets several demands from machine learning practice: ALD (1) is applicable to\narbitrary machine learning classifiers; (2) operates on different definitions\nof disparities (e.g., statistical parity or equalized odds); (3) deals with\nboth categorical and continuous predictors; (4) is suitable to handle\nhigh-dimensional settings; and (5) even identifies disparities due to\nintersectionality where disparities arise from complex and multi-way\ninteractions (e.g., age above 60 and female). ALD produces interpretable\nfairness reports as output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ALD based on\nboth synthetic and real-world datasets. As a result, ALD helps practitioners\nand researchers of algorithmic fairness to detect disparities in machine\nlearning algorithms, so that disparate -- or even unfair -- outcomes can be\nmitigated. Moreover, ALD supports practitioners in conducting algorithmic\naudits and protecting individuals from discrimination.",

    "abstract": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have become the state-of-the-art\ncomputational models of biological object recognition. Their remarkable success\nhas helped vision science break new ground. Consequently, recent efforts have\nstarted to transfer this achievement to the domain of biological face\nrecognition. In this regard, face detection can be investigated through\ncomparisons of face-selective biological areas and neurons to artificial layers\nand units. Similarly, face identification can be examined through comparisons\nof in vivo and in silico face space representations. In this mini-review, we\nsummarize the first studies with this aim. We argue that DCNNs are useful\nmodels, which follow the general hierarchical organization of biological face\nrecognition. In two spotlights, we emphasize unique scientific contributions of\nthese models. Firstly, studies on face detection in DCNNs propose that\nelementary face-selectivity emerges automatically through feedforward\nprocesses. Secondly, studies on face identification in DCNNs suggest that\nexperience and additional generative mechanisms are required for this\nchallenge. Taken together, as this novel computational approach enables close\ncontrol of predisposition (i.e., architecture) and experience (i.e., training\ndata), this could also inform longstanding debates on the substrates of\nbiological face recognition.",

We also suggest a\nplausible mechanism for this distinction. Moreover, we investigate the cases\nwhere scientists involve existing collaborators into a new topic.

An instruction embedding model is a\nneural network that transforms sequences of assembly instructions into\nembedding vectors. If the embedding network is trained such that the\ntranslation from code to vectors partially preserves the semantic, the network\neffectively represents an assembly code model.\nIn this paper we present BinBert, a novel assembly code model. BinBert is\nbuilt on a transformer pre-trained on a huge dataset of both assembly\ninstruction sequences and symbolic execution information. BinBert can be\napplied to assembly instructions sequences and it is fine-tunable, i.e. it can\nbe re-trained as part of a neural architecture on task-specific data. Through\nfine-tuning, BinBert learns how to apply the general knowledge acquired with\npre-training to the specific task.\nWe evaluated BinBert on a multi-task benchmark that we specifically designed\nto test the understanding of assembly code. The benchmark is composed of\nseveral tasks, some taken from the literature, and a few novel tasks that we\ndesigned, with a mix of intrinsic and downstream tasks.\nOur results show that BinBert outperforms state-of-the-art models for binary\ninstruction embedding, raising the bar for binary code understanding.",

    "abstract": "Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an attractive method to acquire vital signs\nsuch as heart rate and blood oxygenation and is frequently used in clinical and\nat-home settings. Continuous operation of health monitoring devices demands a\nlow power sensor that does not restrict the device battery life. Silicon\nphotodiodes (PD) and LEDs are commonly used as the interface devices in PPG\nsensors; however, using of flexible organic devices can enhance the sensor\nconformality and reduce the cost of fabrication. In most PPG sensors, most of\nsystem power consumption is concentrated in powering LEDs, traditionally\nconsuming mWs. Using organic devices further increases this power demand since\nthese devices exhibit larger parasitic capacitances and typically need higher\ndrive voltages. This work presents a sensor IC for continuous SpO$_2$ and HR\nmonitoring that features an on-chip reconstruction-free sparse sampling\nalgorithm to reduce the overall system power consumption by $\\sim$70\\% while\nmaintaining the accuracy of the output information. The designed frontend is\ncompatible with a wide range of devices from silicon PDs to organic PDs with\nparasitic capacitances up to 10 nF. Implemented in a 40 nm HV CMOS process, the\nchip occupies 2.43 mm$^2$ and consumes 49.7 $\\mu$W and 15.2 $\\mu$W of power in\ncontinuous and sparse sampling modes respectively. The performance of the\nsensor IC has been verified \\textit{in vivo} with both types of devices and the\nresults are compared against a clinical grade reference.

In light of these consequential advancements, the current\nwork aspires to provide a full-blown coverage of the following issues, which to\nour knowledge have received feeble or no attention in the literature so far.\nFirst, we provide a complete review of attacks against HTTP/2, and elaborate on\nif and in which way they can be migrated to HTTP/3. Second, through the\ncreation of a testbed comprising the at present six most popular HTTP/3-enabled\nservers, we examine the effectiveness of a quartet of attacks, either stemming\ndirectly from the HTTP/2 relevant literature or being entirely new. This\nscrutiny led to the assignment of at least one CVE ID with a critical base\nscore by MITRE. No less important, by capitalizing on a realistic, abundant in\ndevices testbed, we compiled a voluminous, labeled corpus containing traces of\nten diverse attacks against HTTP and QUIC services. An initial evaluation of\nthe dataset mainly by means of machine learning techniques is included as well.\nGiven that the 30 GB dataset is made available in both pcap and CSV formats,\nforthcoming research can easily take advantage of any subset of features,\ncontingent upon the specific network topology and configuration.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning graph\nrepresentations and thus facilitating various graph-related tasks. However,\nmost GNN methods adopt a supervised learning setting, which is not always\nfeasible in real-world applications due to the difficulty to obtain labeled\ndata. Hence, graph self-supervised learning has been attracting increasing\nattention. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is a representative framework for\nself-supervised learning. In general, GCL learns node representations by\ncontrasting semantically similar nodes (positive samples) and dissimilar nodes\n(negative samples) with anchor nodes. Without access to labels, positive\nsamples are typically generated by data augmentation, and negative samples are\nuniformly sampled from the entire graph, which leads to a sub-optimal\nobjective. Specifically, data augmentation naturally limits the number of\npositive samples that involve in the process (typically only one positive\nsample is adopted). On the other hand, the random sampling process would\ninevitably select false-negative samples (samples sharing the same semantics\nwith the anchor). These issues limit the learning capability of GCL. In this\nwork, we propose an enhanced objective that addresses the aforementioned\nissues. We first introduce an unachievable ideal objective that contains all\npositive samples and no false-negative samples. This ideal objective is then\ntransformed into a probabilistic form based on the distributions for sampling\npositive and negative samples. We then model these distributions with node\nsimilarity and derive the enhanced objective.

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a surging interest in formulating recommendations in\nthe context of causal inference. The studies regard the recommendation as an\nintervention in causal inference and frame the users' preferences as\ninterventional effects to improve recommender systems' generalization. Many\nstudies in the field of causal inference for recommender systems have been\nfocusing on utilizing propensity scores from the causal community that reduce\nthe bias while inducing additional variance. Alternatively, some studies\nsuggest the existence of a set of unbiased data from randomized controlled\ntrials while it requires to satisfy certain assumptions that may be challenging\nin practice. In this paper, we first design a causal graph representing\nrecommender systems' data generation and propagation process. Then, we reveal\nthat the underlying exposure mechanism biases the maximum likelihood estimation\n(MLE) on observational feedback. In order to figure out users' preferences in\nterms of causality behind data, we leverage the back-door adjustment and\ndo-calculus, which induces an interventional recommendation model (IREC).\nFurthermore, considering the confounder may be inaccessible for measurement, we\npropose a contrastive counterfactual learning method (CCL) for simulating the\nintervention.

Observational studies are growing in significance in answering\nsuch questions due to their widespread accumulation and comparatively easier\nacquisition than Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). Recently, some works have\nintroduced representation learning and domain adaptation into counterfactual\ninference. However, most current works focus on the setting of binary\ntreatments. None of them considers that different treatments' sample sizes are\nimbalanced, especially data examples in some treatment groups are relatively\nlimited due to inherent user preference.

Moreover, we introduce two\ncomplementary losses.

    "abstract": "The total electricity consumption from offshore oil/gas platforms is around\n16 TWh worldwide in 2019. The majority offshore platforms are powered by the\ndiesel generators while the rest mainly uses gas turbines, which emits large\namounts of CO2 per year. The fast development of offshore wind turbines (WT)\ncan potentially replace traditional fossil fuel based resources to power\noffshore loads. Thus, a novel offshore hybrid renewable energy sources (OHRES)\nsystem is proposed to enable a zero CO2 emission offshore platform mitigating\nclimate change. Battery energy storage system (BESS) and hydrogen energy\nstorage system (HESS) are considered to mitigate the fluctuation of wind power\nin the proposed OHRES system. Resilience models are designed to enhance the\nresilience of the proposed OHRES system with extra energy stored in BESS and/or\nHESS. Case studies demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed OHRES system to\npower offshore platforms. The economic analysis reports the planning cost for\nthe proposed OHRES system under different resilience levels, which may benefit\nthe decision to balance the carbon emission and investment cost.",

    "abstract": "YouTube users looking for instructions for a specific task may spend a long\ntime browsing content trying to find the right video that matches their needs.\nCreating a visual summary (abridged version of a video) provides viewers with a\nquick overview and massively reduces search time. In this work, we focus on\nsummarizing instructional videos, an under-explored area of video\nsummarization. In comparison to generic videos, instructional videos can be\nparsed into semantically meaningful segments that correspond to important steps\nof the demonstrated task. Existing video summarization datasets rely on manual\nframe-level annotations, making them subjective and limited in size. To\novercome this, we first automatically generate pseudo summaries for a corpus of\ninstructional videos by exploiting two key assumptions: (i) relevant steps are\nlikely to appear in multiple videos of the same task (Task Relevance), and (ii)\nthey are more likely to be described by the demonstrator verbally (Cross-Modal\nSaliency). We propose an instructional video summarization network that\ncombines a context-aware temporal video encoder and a segment scoring\ntransformer. Using pseudo summaries as weak supervision, our network constructs\na visual summary for an instructional video given only video and transcribed\nspeech. To evaluate our model, we collect a high-quality test set, WikiHow\nSummaries, by scraping WikiHow articles that contain video demonstrations and\nvisual depictions of steps allowing us to obtain the ground-truth summaries.

By facilitating labeled links of the graph\nas the training data, numerous deep learning based link prediction methods have\nbeen studied, which have dominant prediction accuracy compared with non-deep\nmethods. However,the threats of maliciously crafted training graph will leave a\nspecific backdoor in the deep model, thus when some specific examples are fed\ninto the model, it will make wrong prediction, defined as backdoor attack. It\nis an important aspect that has been overlooked in the current literature. In\nthis paper, we prompt the concept of backdoor attack on link prediction, and\npropose Link-Backdoor to reveal the training vulnerability of the existing link\nprediction methods. Specifically, the Link-Backdoor combines the fake nodes\nwith the nodes of the target link to form a trigger. Moreover, it optimizes the\ntrigger by the gradient information from the target model. Consequently, the\nlink prediction model trained on the backdoored dataset will predict the link\nwith trigger to the target state. Extensive experiments on five benchmark\ndatasets and five well-performing link prediction models demonstrate that the\nLink-Backdoor achieves the state-of-the-art attack success rate under both\nwhite-box (i.e., available of the target model parameter)and black-box (i.e.,\nunavailable of the target model parameter) scenarios. Additionally, we testify\nthe attack under defensive circumstance, and the results indicate that the\nLink-Backdoor still can construct successful attack on the well-performing link\nprediction methods.

In this paper,\nwe analyze a wireless charging infrastructure sharing strategy in UAV and\nEV-involved networks. We consider a scenario where UAVs can charge in EV\ncharging stations and pay for the sharing fee.

On the UAVs' side, if renting EV charging stations\ncan achieve an acceptable system performance, say high coverage probability,\nwhile considering the cost, they may not need to build their dedicated charging\nstations. In this case, we use tools from stochastic geometry to model the\nlocations and propose an optimization problem that captures the aforementioned\ntrade-offs between cost or profit and quality of service. Our numerical results\nshow that sharing infrastructure slightly increases the waiting time of EVs,\nsay within $5$ min, but dramatically decreases the waiting time of drones, say\nmore than $50$ min, and deploying more charging stations do achieve better\nperformances, but all these better performances are expected to cost more.",

Various splitting methods have been designed to separate different\nphysics, nonlinearities, and so on. Recently, a new splitting approach has been\nproposed where some degrees of freedom are handled implicitly while other\ndegrees of freedom are handled explicitly. As a result, the scheme contains two\nequations, one implicit and the other explicit. The stability of this approach\nhas been studied. It was shown that the time step scales as the coarse spatial\nmesh size, which can provide a significant computational advantage. However,\nthe implicit solution part can still be expensive, especially for nonlinear\nproblems. In this paper, we introduce modified partial machine learning\nalgorithms to replace the implicit solution part of the algorithm. These\nalgorithms are first introduced in arXiv:2109.02147, where a homogeneous source\nterm is considered along with the Transformer, which is a neural network that\ncan predict future dynamics. In this paper, we consider time-dependent source\nterms which is a generalization of the previous work. Moreover, we use the\nwhole history of the solution to train the network. As the implicit part of the\nequations is more complicated to solve, we design a neural network to predict\nit based on training. Furthermore, we compute the explicit part of the solution\nusing our splitting strategy. In addition, we use Proper Orthogonal\nDecomposition based model reduction in machine learning.

However, in\norder to outperform conventional communication systems, an RIS-aided system\nwith solely passive reflection requires an extremely large surface. To meet\nthis challenge, the concept of active RIS, which performs simultaneous\namplification and reflection on the incident signal at the expense of\nadditional power consumption, has been recently introduced. In this paper,\ndeploying an active RIS, we propose a novel beamforming concept, over-the-air\nbeamforming, for RIS-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO)\ntransmission schemes without requiring any pre/post signal processing hardware\ndesigns at the transmitter and receiver sides. In the proposed over-the-air\nbeamforming-based transmission scheme, the reflection coefficients of the\nactive RIS elements are customized to maximize the sum-rate gain. To tackle\nthis issue, first, a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming\n(QCQP) problem is formulated. Then, using semidefinite relaxation (SDR)\napproach, this optimization problem is converted to a convex feasibility\nproblem, which is efficiently solved using the CVX optimization toolbox.\nMoreover, taking inspiration from this beamforming technique, a novel high-rate\nreceive index modulation (IM) scheme with a low-complexity sub-optimal detector\nis developed.

Therefore, we expect to\nrelax this assumption by defining a new semi-supervised inpainting setting,\nmaking the networks have the ability of completing the corrupted regions of the\nwhole video using the annotated mask of only one frame.

Besides, we introduce a cycle\nconsistency loss to regularize the training parameters of these two networks.\nIn this way, the completion network and the mask prediction network can\nconstrain each other, and hence the overall performance of the trained model\ncan be maximized. Furthermore, due to the natural existence of prior knowledge\n(e.g., corrupted contents and clear borders), current video inpainting datasets\nare not suitable in the context of semi-supervised video inpainting.

This leads to poor OOD performance which, according to our\nexperiments, is mainly due to unintended cross-attribute correlations of the\npredicted confidence scores. We provide an empirical evidence showing that this\nbehavior is consistent across different baselines on both synthetic and real\nworld datasets.",

    "title": "Generic Go to Go: Dictionary-Passing, Monomorphisation, and Hybrid",
    "abstract": "Go is a popular statically-typed industrial programming language. To aid the\ntype safe reuse of code, the recent Go release (Go 1.18) published on 15th\nMarch 2022 includes bounded parametric polymorphism via generic types. Go 1.18\nimplements generic types using combination of monomorphisation and call-graph\nbased dictionary-passing called hybrid. This hybrid approach can be viewed as\nan optimised form of monomorphisation that statically generates specialised\nmethods and types based on possible instantiations. A monolithic dictionary\nsupplements information lost during monomorphisation, and it is structured\naccording to the program's call graph. Unfortunately, the hybrid approach still\nsuffers from code bloat, poor compilation speed, and limited code coverage.\nIn this paper we propose and formalise a new non-specialising call-site based\ndictionary-passing translation. Our call-site based translation creates\nindividual dictionaries for each type parameter, with dictionary construction\noccurring in place of instantiation, overcoming the limitations of hybrid. We\nprove it correct using a novel and general bisimulation up to technique. To\nbetter understand how different generics translations approaches work in\npractice, we benchmark five translators, Go 1.18, two existing monomorphisation\ntranslators, our dictionary-passing translator, and erasure translator. Our\nfindings reveal several suggestions for improvements for Go 1.18 --\nspecifically how to overcome the expressiveness limitations of generic Go, and\nimprove compile time and compiled code size performance of Go 1.18.",

    "abstract": "Point cloud filtering and normal estimation are two fundamental research\nproblems in the 3D field. Existing methods usually perform normal estimation\nand filtering separately and often show sensitivity to noise and/or inability\nto preserve sharp geometric features such as corners and edges. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel deep learning method to jointly estimate normals and filter\npoint clouds. We first introduce a 3D patch based contrastive learning\nframework, with noise corruption as an augmentation, to train a feature encoder\ncapable of generating faithful representations of point cloud patches while\nremaining robust to noise. These representations are consumed by a simple\nregression network and supervised by a novel joint loss, simultaneously\nestimating point normals and displacements that are used to filter the patch\ncenters. Experimental results show that our method well supports the two tasks\nsimultaneously and preserves sharp features and fine details. It generally\noutperforms state-of-the-art techniques on both tasks.",

    "abstract": "Most practical scheduling applications involve some uncertainty about the\narriving times and lengths of the jobs. Stochastic online scheduling is a\nwell-established model capturing this. Here the arrivals occur online, while\nthe processing times are random. For this model, Gupta, Moseley, Uetz, and Xie\nrecently devised an efficient policy for non-preemptive scheduling on unrelated\nmachines with the objective to minimize the expected total weighted completion\ntime. We improve upon this policy by adroitly combining greedy job assignment\nwith $\\alpha_j$-point scheduling on each machine. In this way we obtain a\n$(3+\\sqrt 5)(2+\\Delta)$-competitive deterministic and an\n$(8+4\\Delta)$-competitive randomized stochastic online scheduling policy, where\n$\\Delta$ is an upper bound on the squared coefficients of variation of the\nprocessing times. We also give constant performance guarantees for these\npolicies within the class of all fixed-assignment policies. The\n$\\alpha_j$-point scheduling on a single machine can be enhanced when the upper\nbound $\\Delta$ is known a priori or the processing times are known to be\n$\\delta$-NBUE for some $\\delta \\ge 1$. This implies improved competitive ratios\nfor unrelated machines but may also be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Low-light environments have posed a formidable challenge for robust unmanned\naerial vehicle (UAV) tracking even with state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers since\nthe potential image features are hard to extract under adverse light\nconditions. Besides, due to the low visibility, accurate online selection of\nthe object also becomes extremely difficult for human monitors to initialize\nUAV tracking in ground control stations. To solve these problems, this work\nproposes a novel enhancer, i.e., HighlightNet, to light up potential objects\nfor both human operators and UAV trackers. By employing Transformer,\nHighlightNet can adjust enhancement parameters according to global features and\nis thus adaptive for the illumination variation. Pixel-level range mask is\nintroduced to make HighlightNet more focused on the enhancement of the tracking\nobject and regions without light sources. Furthermore, a soft truncation\nmechanism is built to prevent background noise from being mistaken for crucial\nfeatures. Evaluations on image enhancement benchmarks demonstrate HighlightNet\nhas advantages in facilitating human perception. Experiments on the public\nUAVDark135 benchmark show that HightlightNet is more suitable for UAV tracking\ntasks than other SOTA low-light enhancers. In addition, real-world tests on a\ntypical UAV platform verify HightlightNet's practicability and efficiency in\nnighttime aerial tracking-related applications.

    "abstract": "The architectural advancements in deep neural networks have led to remarkable\nleap-forwards across a broad array of computer vision tasks. Instead of relying\non human expertise, neural architecture search (NAS) has emerged as a promising\navenue toward automating the design of architectures. While recent achievements\nin image classification have suggested opportunities, the promises of NAS have\nyet to be thoroughly assessed on more challenging tasks of semantic\nsegmentation. The main challenges of applying NAS to semantic segmentation\narise from two aspects: (i) high-resolution images to be processed; (ii)\nadditional requirement of real-time inference speed (i.e., real-time semantic\nsegmentation) for applications such as autonomous driving. To meet such\nchallenges, we propose a surrogate-assisted multi-objective method in this\npaper. Through a series of customized prediction models, our method effectively\ntransforms the original NAS task into an ordinary multi-objective optimization\nproblem. Followed by a hierarchical pre-screening criterion for in-fill\nselection, our method progressively achieves a set of efficient architectures\ntrading-off between segmentation accuracy and inference speed. Empirical\nevaluations on three benchmark datasets together with an application using\nHuawei Atlas 200 DK suggest that our method can identify architectures\nsignificantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art architectures designed\nboth manually by human experts and automatically by other NAS methods.",

The learning procedure usually costs lots of time, which motivates\nthe latest methods to speed up the learning procedure by learning without\nneural networks or using more efficient data structures. However, these\nspecially designed approaches do not work for most of radiance fields based\nmethods. To resolve this issue, we introduce a general strategy to speed up the\nlearning procedure for almost all radiance fields based methods. Our key idea\nis to reduce the redundancy by shooting much fewer rays in the multi-view\nvolume rendering procedure which is the base for almost all radiance fields\nbased methods. We find that shooting rays at pixels with dramatic color change\nnot only significantly reduces the training burden but also barely affects the\naccuracy of the learned radiance fields. In addition, we also adaptively\nsubdivide each view into a quadtree according to the average rendering error in\neach node in the tree, which makes us dynamically shoot more rays in more\ncomplex regions with larger rendering error. We evaluate our method with\ndifferent radiance fields based methods under the widely used benchmarks.\nExperimental results show that our method achieves comparable accuracy to the\nstate-of-the-art with much faster training.",

Analogously, distilling such large models to compact models for\nefficient deployment also necessitates a large amount of (labeled or unlabeled)\ntraining data. In this paper, we propose the teacher-guided training (TGT)\nframework for training a high-quality compact model that leverages the\nknowledge acquired by pretrained generative models, while obviating the need to\ngo through a large volume of data. TGT exploits the fact that the teacher has\nacquired a good representation of the underlying data domain, which typically\ncorresponds to a much lower dimensional manifold than the input space.\nFurthermore, we can use the teacher to explore input space more efficiently\nthrough sampling or gradient-based methods; thus, making TGT especially\nattractive for limited data or long-tail settings.

In $k$-Median,\nthe input consists of a set $X$ of $n$ points belonging to a metric space, and\nthe task is to select a subset $C \\subseteq X$ of $k$ points as centers, such\nthat the sum of the distances of every point to its nearest center is\nminimized. In $k$-Means, the objective is to minimize the sum of squares of the\ndistances instead. It is easy to design an algorithm running in time\n$\\max_{k\\leq n} {n \\choose k} n^{O(1)} = O^*(2^n)$ ($O^*(\\cdot)$ notation hides\npolynomial factors in $n$). We design first non-trivial exact algorithms for\nthese problems. In particular, we obtain an $O^*((1.89)^n)$ time exact\nalgorithm for $k$-Median that works for any value of $k$. Our algorithm is\nquite general in that it does not use any properties of the underlying (metric)\nspace -- it does not even require the distances to satisfy the triangle\ninequality. In particular, the same algorithm also works for $k$-Means. We\ncomplement this result by showing that the running time of our algorithm is\nasymptotically optimal, up to the base of the exponent. That is, unless ETH\nfails, there is no algorithm for these problems running in time $2^{o(n)} \\cdot\nn^{O(1)}$.\nFinally, we consider the \"supplier\" versions of these clustering problems,\nwhere, in addition to the set $X$ we are additionally given a set of $m$\ncandidate centers $F$, and objective is to find a subset of $k$ centers from\n$F$. The goal is still to minimize the $k$-Median/$k$-Means/$k$-Center\nobjective. For these versions we give a $O(2^n (mn)^{O(1)})$ time algorithms\nusing subset convolution.

    "title": "Underwater Ranker: Learn Which Is Better and How to Be Better",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a ranking-based underwater image quality assessment\n(UIQA) method, abbreviated as URanker. The URanker is built on the efficient\nconv-attentional image Transformer. In terms of underwater images, we specially\ndevise (1) the histogram prior that embeds the color distribution of an\nunderwater image as histogram token to attend global degradation and (2) the\ndynamic cross-scale correspondence to model local degradation. The final\nprediction depends on the class tokens from different scales, which\ncomprehensively considers multi-scale dependencies. With the margin ranking\nloss, our URanker can accurately rank the order of underwater images of the\nsame scene enhanced by different underwater image enhancement (UIE) algorithms\naccording to their visual quality. To achieve that, we also contribute a\ndataset, URankerSet, containing sufficient results enhanced by different UIE\nalgorithms and the corresponding perceptual rankings, to train our URanker.\nApart from the good performance of URanker, we found that a simple U-shape UIE\nnetwork can obtain promising performance when it is coupled with our\npre-trained URanker as additional supervision. In addition, we also propose a\nnormalization tail that can significantly improve the performance of UIE\nnetworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of\nour method. The key designs of our method are discussed. We will release our\ndataset and code.",

In this paper, we carried\nout in-depth investigations on metric learning in deep hashing for establishing\na powerful metric space in multi-label scenarios, where the pair loss suffers\nhigh computational overhead and converge difficulty, while the proxy loss is\ntheoretically incapable of expressing the profound label dependencies and\nexhibits conflicts in the constructed hypersphere space.

    "abstract": "Multilingual Neural Machine Translation has been showing great success using\ntransformer models. Deploying these models is challenging because they usually\nrequire large vocabulary (vocab) sizes for various languages. This limits the\nspeed of predicting the output tokens in the last vocab projection layer. To\nalleviate these challenges, this paper proposes a fast vocabulary projection\nmethod via clustering which can be used for multilingual transformers on GPUs.\nFirst, we offline split the vocab search space into disjoint clusters given the\nhidden context vector of the decoder output, which results in much smaller\nvocab columns for vocab projection. Second, at inference time, the proposed\nmethod predicts the clusters and candidate active tokens for hidden context\nvectors at the vocab projection. This paper also includes analysis of different\nways of building these clusters in multilingual settings. Our results show\nend-to-end speed gains in float16 GPU inference up to 25% while maintaining the\nBLEU score and slightly increasing memory cost. The proposed method speeds up\nthe vocab projection step itself by up to 2.6x. We also conduct an extensive\nhuman evaluation to verify the proposed method preserves the quality of the\ntranslations from the original model.",

    "abstract": "Users of a recommender system may want part of their data being deleted, not\nonly from the data repository but also from the underlying machine learning\nmodel, for privacy or utility reasons. Such right-to-be-forgotten requests\ncould be fulfilled by simply retraining the recommendation model from scratch,\nbut that would be too slow and too expensive in practice. In this paper, we\ninvestigate fast machine unlearning techniques for recommender systems that can\nremove the effect of a small amount of training data from the recommendation\nmodel without incurring the full cost of retraining. A natural idea to speed\nthis process up is to fine-tune the current recommendation model on the\nremaining training data instead of starting from a random initialization. This\nwarm-start strategy indeed works for neural recommendation models using\nstandard 1st-order neural network optimizers (like AdamW). However, we have\nfound that even greater acceleration could be achieved by employing 2nd-order\n(Newton or quasi-Newton) optimization methods instead. To overcome the\nprohibitively high computational cost of 2nd-order optimizers, we propose a new\nrecommendation unlearning approach AltEraser which divides the optimization\nproblem of unlearning into many small tractable sub-problems. Extensive\nexperiments on three real-world recommendation datasets show promising results\nof AltEraser in terms of consistency (forgetting thoroughness), accuracy\n(recommendation effectiveness), and efficiency (unlearning speed).

    "abstract": "Reconstructing a 3D shape based on a single sketch image is challenging due\nto the large domain gap between a sparse, irregular sketch and a regular, dense\n3D shape. Existing works try to employ the global feature extracted from sketch\nto directly predict the 3D coordinates, but they usually suffer from losing\nfine details that are not faithful to the input sketch. Through analyzing the\n3D-to-2D projection process, we notice that the density map that characterizes\nthe distribution of 2D point clouds (i.e., the probability of points projected\nat each location of the projection plane) can be used as a proxy to facilitate\nthe reconstruction process. To this end, we first translate a sketch via an\nimage translation network to a more informative 2D representation that can be\nused to generate a density map. Next, a 3D point cloud is reconstructed via a\ntwo-stage probabilistic sampling process: first recovering the 2D points (i.e.,\nthe x and y coordinates) by sampling the density map; and then predicting the\ndepth (i.e., the z coordinate) by sampling the depth values at the ray\ndetermined by each 2D point.

Thus, we propose\na new concept: Continuous Classification of Time Series (CCTS). It requires the\nmodel to learn data in different time stages. But the time series evolves\ndynamically, leading to different data distributions. When a model learns\nmulti-distribution, it always forgets or overfits.

Previous\nmethods that rely on learning local information typically cannot do well in\npreserving color conformity and long-range structural similarity, resulting in\nunnatural color transition and texture artifacts. In order to tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a global priors guided modulation network (GPGMNet) for\njoint SR-ITM. In particular, we design a global priors extraction module (GPEM)\nto extract color conformity prior and structural similarity prior that are\nbeneficial for ITM and SR tasks, respectively. To further exploit the global\npriors and preserve spatial information, we devise multiple global priors\nguided spatial-wise modulation blocks (GSMBs) with a few parameters for\nintermediate feature modulation, in which the modulation parameters are\ngenerated by the shared global priors and the spatial features map from the\nspatial pyramid convolution block (SPCB).

Fully connected\nlayers can be studied by decomposing their weight matrices using a singular\nvalue decomposition, in effect studying the correlations between the rows in\neach matrix to discover the dynamics of the map.

    "abstract": "Lateral inhibitory connections have been observed in the cortex of the\nbiological brain, and has been extensively studied in terms of its role in\ncognitive functions. However, in the vanilla version of backpropagation in deep\nlearning, all gradients (which can be understood to comprise of both signal and\nnoise gradients) flow through the network during weight updates. This may lead\nto overfitting. In this work, inspired by biological lateral inhibition, we\npropose Gradient Mask, which effectively filters out noise gradients in the\nprocess of backpropagation. This allows the learned feature information to be\nmore intensively stored in the network while filtering out noisy or unimportant\nfeatures. Furthermore, we demonstrate analytically how lateral inhibition in\nartificial neural networks improves the quality of propagated gradients. A new\ncriterion for gradient quality is proposed which can be used as a measure\nduring training of various convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Finally, we\nconduct several different experiments to study how Gradient Mask improves the\nperformance of the network both quantitatively and qualitatively.\nQuantitatively, accuracy in the original CNN architecture, accuracy after\npruning, and accuracy after adversarial attacks have shown improvements.\nQualitatively, the CNN trained using Gradient Mask has developed saliency maps\nthat focus primarily on the object of interest, which is useful for data\naugmentation and network interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Visual (re)localization addresses the problem of estimating the 6-DoF (Degree\nof Freedom) camera pose of a query image captured in a known scene, which is a\nkey building block of many computer vision and robotics applications. Recent\nadvances in structure-based localization solve this problem by memorizing the\nmapping from image pixels to scene coordinates with neural networks to build\n2D-3D correspondences for camera pose optimization. However, such memorization\nrequires training by amounts of posed images in each scene, which is heavy and\ninefficient. On the contrary, few-shot images are usually sufficient to cover\nthe main regions of a scene for a human operator to perform visual\nlocalization. In this paper, we propose a scene region classification approach\nto achieve fast and effective scene memorization with few-shot images. Our\ninsight is leveraging a) pre-learned feature extractor, b) scene region\nclassifier, and c) meta-learning strategy to accelerate training while\nmitigating overfitting. We evaluate our method on both indoor and outdoor\nbenchmarks. The experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in the\nfew-shot setting, and the training time is significantly reduced to only a few\nminutes.

This is because r-orders are\nthe minimizers of an appropriately defined optimization problem that could be\neither solved exactly (using a reinforcement learning approach) or\napproximately (using a hill-climbing search). Moreover, the r-orders (unlike\nc-orders) are invariant among all the graphs in a MEC and include c-orders as a\nsubset. Given that set of r-orders is often significantly larger than the set\nof c-orders, it is easier for the optimization problem to find an r-order\ninstead of a c-order.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the impact of data freshness on real-time\nsupervised learning, where a neural network is trained to infer a time-varying\ntarget (e.g., the position of the vehicle in front) based on features (e.g.,\nvideo frames) observed at a sensing node (e.g., camera or lidar). One might\nexpect that the performance of real-time supervised learning degrades\nmonotonically as the feature becomes stale. Using an information-theoretic\nanalysis, we show that this is true if the feature and target data sequence can\nbe closely approximated as a Markov chain; it is not true if the data sequence\nis far from Markovian. Hence, the prediction error of real-time supervised\nlearning is a function of the Age of Information (AoI), where the function\ncould be non-monotonic. Several experiments are conducted to illustrate the\nmonotonic and non-monotonic behaviors of the prediction error. To minimize the\ninference error in real-time, we propose a new \"selection-from-buffer\" model\nfor sending the features, which is more general than the \"generate-at-will\"\nmodel used in earlier studies. By using Gittins and Whittle indices,\nlow-complexity scheduling strategies are developed to minimize the inference\nerror, where a new connection between the Gittins index theory and Age of\nInformation (AoI) minimization is discovered. These scheduling results hold (i)\nfor minimizing general AoI functions (monotonic or non-monotonic) and (ii) for\ngeneral feature transmission time distributions. Data-driven evaluations are\npresented to illustrate the benefits of the proposed scheduling algorithms.",

The Morse-Smale complex captures a wide range of\nfeatures by partitioning the domain of a scalar function into piecewise\nmonotonic regions, while persistent homology provides a means to study these\nfeatures at different scales of simplification. Previous works demonstrated how\nto compute such a representation and its usefulness to gain insight into\nmulti-dimensional data. However, exploration of the multi-scale nature of the\ndata was limited to selecting a single simplification threshold from a plot of\nregion count. In this paper, we present a novel tree visualization that\nprovides a concise overview of the entire hierarchy of topological features.\nThe structure of the tree provides initial insights in terms of the\ndistribution, size, and stability of all partitions. We use regression analysis\nto fit linear models in each partition, and develop local and relative measures\nto further assess uniqueness and the importance of each partition, especially\nwith respect parents/children in the feature hierarchy. The expressiveness of\nthe tree visualization becomes apparent when we encode such measures using\ncolors, and the layout allows an unprecedented level of control over feature\nselection during exploration. For instance, selecting features from multiple\nscales of the hierarchy enables a more nuanced exploration. Finally, we\ndemonstrate our approach using examples from several scientific domains.",

    "abstract": "Graph coloring, a classical and critical NP-hard problem, is the problem of\nassigning connected nodes as different colors as possible. However, we observe\nthat state-of-the-art GNNs are less successful in the graph coloring problem.\nWe analyze the reasons from two perspectives. First, most GNNs fail to\ngeneralize the task under homophily to heterophily, i.e., graphs where\nconnected nodes are assigned different colors. Second, GNNs are bounded by the\nnetwork depth, making them possible to be a local method, which has been\ndemonstrated to be non-optimal in Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. In\nthis paper, we focus on the aggregation-combine GNNs (AC-GNNs), a popular class\nof GNNs. We first define the power of AC-GNNs in the coloring problem as the\ncapability to assign nodes different colors. The definition is different with\nprevious one that is based on the assumption of homophily. We identify node\npairs that AC-GNNs fail to discriminate. Furthermore, we show that any AC-GNN\nis a local coloring method, and any local coloring method is non-optimal by\nexploring the limits of local methods over sparse random graphs, thereby\ndemonstrating the non-optimality of AC-GNNs due to its local property. We then\nprove the positive correlation between model depth and its coloring power.\nMoreover, we discuss the color equivariance of graphs to tackle some practical\nconstraints such as the pre-fixing constraints. Following the discussions\nabove, we summarize a series of rules a series of rules that make a GNN color\nequivariant and powerful in the coloring problem. Then, we propose a simple\nAC-GNN variation satisfying these rules.

The ETA prediction models previously deployed at Baidu\nMaps have addressed the factors of spatial-temporal interaction (ConSTGAT) and\ndriving behavior (SSML). In this work, we focus on modeling traffic congestion\npropagation patterns to improve ETA performance. Traffic congestion propagation\npattern modeling is challenging, and it requires accounting for impact regions\nover time and cumulative effect of delay variations over time caused by traffic\nevents on the road network. In this paper, we present a practical\nindustrial-grade ETA prediction framework named DuETA. Specifically, we\nconstruct a congestion-sensitive graph based on the correlations of traffic\npatterns, and we develop a route-aware graph transformer to directly learn the\nlong-distance correlations of the road segments. This design enables DuETA to\ncapture the interactions between the road segment pairs that are spatially\ndistant but highly correlated with traffic conditions. Extensive experiments\nare conducted on large-scale, real-world datasets collected from Baidu Maps.\nExperimental results show that ETA prediction can significantly benefit from\nthe learned traffic congestion propagation patterns. In addition, DuETA has\nalready been deployed in production at Baidu Maps, serving billions of requests\nevery day. This demonstrates that DuETA is an industrial-grade and robust\nsolution for large-scale ETA prediction services.",

    "abstract": "With the growing adoption of deep learning for on-device TinyML applications,\nthere has been an ever-increasing demand for more efficient neural network\nbackbones optimized for the edge. Recently, the introduction of attention\ncondenser networks have resulted in low-footprint, highly-efficient,\nself-attention neural networks that strike a strong balance between accuracy\nand speed. In this study, we introduce a new faster attention condenser design\ncalled double-condensing attention condensers that enable more condensed\nfeature embedding. We further employ a machine-driven design exploration\nstrategy that imposes best practices design constraints for greater efficiency\nand robustness to produce the macro-micro architecture constructs of the\nbackbone. The resulting backbone (which we name AttendNeXt) achieves\nsignificantly higher inference throughput on an embedded ARM processor when\ncompared to several other state-of-the-art efficient backbones (>10X faster\nthan FB-Net C at higher accuracy and speed) while having a small model size\n(>1.47X smaller than OFA-62 at higher speed and similar accuracy) and strong\naccuracy (1.1% higher top-1 accuracy than MobileViT XS on ImageNet at higher\nspeed). These promising results demonstrate that exploring different efficient\narchitecture designs and self-attention mechanisms can lead to interesting new\nbuilding blocks for TinyML applications.",

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of adversarial examples has been revealed in variant\nscenarios. Recent studies show that well-designed adversarial defense\nstrategies can improve the robustness of deep learning models against\nadversarial examples. However, with the rapid development of defense\ntechnologies, it also tends to be more difficult to evaluate the robustness of\nthe defensed model due to the weak performance of existing manually designed\nadversarial attacks. To address the challenge, given the defensed model, the\nefficient adversarial attack with less computational burden and lower robust\naccuracy is needed to be further exploited. Therefore, we propose a\nmulti-objective memetic algorithm for auto adversarial attack optimization\ndesign, which realizes the automatical search for the near-optimal adversarial\nattack towards defensed models. Firstly, the more general mathematical model of\nauto adversarial attack optimization design is constructed, where the search\nspace includes not only the attacker operations, magnitude, iteration number,\nand loss functions but also the connection ways of multiple adversarial\nattacks. In addition, we develop a multi-objective memetic algorithm combining\nNSGA-II and local search to solve the optimization problem. Finally, to\ndecrease the evaluation cost during the search, we propose a representative\ndata selection strategy based on the sorting of cross entropy loss values of\neach images output by models.

In recent years, several deep learning and machine learning based\nsleep staging algorithms have been developed and they have achieved performance\non par with human annotation. Despite improved performance, a limitation of\nmost deep-learning based algorithms is their Black-box behavior, which which\nhave limited their use in clinical settings. Here, we propose Cross-Modal\nTransformers, which is a transformer-based method for sleep stage\nclassification.

Based on\nthe theoretical framework above, we explain some experimental results of\nvariational autoencoders, denoising autoencoders, and linear-unit autoencoders,\nwith emphasis on the interpretation of the lower-dimensional representation of\ndata via encoders; and the mechanism of image restoration through autoencoders\nis natural to be understood by those explanations.

    "abstract": "Comprehensive global cooperation is essential to limit global temperature\nincreases while continuing economic development, e.g., reducing severe\ninequality or achieving long-term economic growth. Achieving long-term\ncooperation on climate change mitigation with n strategic agents poses a\ncomplex game-theoretic problem. For example, agents may negotiate and reach\nclimate agreements, but there is no central authority to enforce adherence to\nthose agreements. Hence, it is critical to design negotiation and agreement\nframeworks that foster cooperation, allow all agents to meet their individual\npolicy objectives, and incentivize long-term adherence. This is an\ninterdisciplinary challenge that calls for collaboration between researchers in\nmachine learning, economics, climate science, law, policy, ethics, and other\nfields.

To facilitate this research, here we\nintroduce RICE-N, a multi-region integrated assessment model that simulates the\nglobal climate and economy, and which can be used to design and evaluate the\nstrategic outcomes for different negotiation and agreement frameworks.

    "abstract": "In medical imaging, surface registration is extensively used for performing\nsystematic comparisons between anatomical structures, with a prime example\nbeing the highly convoluted brain cortical surfaces. To obtain a meaningful\nregistration, a common approach is to identify prominent features on the\nsurfaces and establish a low-distortion mapping between them with the feature\ncorrespondence encoded as landmark constraints. Prior registration works have\nprimarily focused on using manually labeled landmarks and solving highly\nnonlinear optimization problems, which are time-consuming and hence hinder\npractical applications. In this work, we propose a novel framework for the\nautomatic landmark detection and registration of brain cortical surfaces using\nquasi-conformal geometry and convolutional neural networks. We first develop a\nlandmark detection network (LD-Net) that allows for the automatic extraction of\nlandmark curves given two prescribed starting and ending points based on the\nsurface geometry. We then utilize the detected landmarks and quasi-conformal\ntheory for achieving the surface registration. Specifically, we develop a\ncoefficient prediction network (CP-Net) for predicting the Beltrami\ncoefficients associated with the desired landmark-based registration and a\nmapping network called the disk Beltrami solver network (DBS-Net) for\ngenerating quasi-conformal mappings from the predicted Beltrami coefficients,\nwith the bijectivity guaranteed by quasi-conformal theory. Experimental results\nare presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\nAltogether, our work paves a new way for surface-based morphometry and medical\nshape analysis.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown expressive performance on graph\nrepresentation learning by aggregating information from neighbors. Recently,\nsome studies have discussed the importance of modeling neighborhood\ndistribution on the graph. However, most existing GNNs aggregate neighbors'\nfeatures through single statistic (e.g., mean, max, sum), which loses the\ninformation related to neighbor's feature distribution and therefore degrades\nthe model performance. In this paper, inspired by the method of moment in\nstatistical theory, we propose to model neighbor's feature distribution with\nmulti-order moments. We design a novel GNN model, namely Mix-Moment Graph\nNeural Network (MM-GNN), which includes a Multi-order Moment Embedding (MME)\nmodule and an Element-wise Attention-based Moment Adaptor module. MM-GNN first\ncalculates the multi-order moments of the neighbors for each node as\nsignatures, and then use an Element-wise Attention-based Moment Adaptor to\nassign larger weights to important moments for each node and update node\nrepresentations. We conduct extensive experiments on 15 real-world graphs\n(including social networks, citation networks and web-page networks etc.) to\nevaluate our model, and the results demonstrate the superiority of MM-GNN over\nexisting state-of-the-art models.",

According to the least multi-indices and the\ngreatest essential multi-index sets, which are introduced as new notions and\ncan be obtained from the system equations, two classification schemes of lower\ntriangular forms are constructed.

Neural networks (NNs) are newer powerful tools which can be\nused to learn complex mappings from states to cost-to-go heuristics.

Several\nrecent works have described ways to take advantage of NN's batch computations\nto decrease overhead in planning, while retaining bounds on (sub)optimality.\nHowever, all these methods have used the NN heuristic in a \"blocking\" manner\nwhile building up their batches, and have ignored possible fast-to-compute\nadmissible heuristics (e.g. existing classically derived heuristics) that are\nusually available to use. We introduce Non-Blocking Batch A* (NBBA*), a bounded\nsuboptimal method which lazily computes the NN heuristic in batches while\nallowing expansions informed by a non-NN heuristic. We show how this subtle but\nimportant change can lead to substantial reductions in expansions compared to\nthe current blocking alternative, and see that the performance is related to\nthe information difference between the batch computed NN and fast non-NN\nheuristic.",

This task\nmodel is used in a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) problem to optimize\nrobot trajectory and impedance according to belief in discrete human goals,\nhuman kinematics, safety constraints, contact stability, and frequency-domain\ndisturbance rejection.

We propose a novel 3D\nscene photorealistic style transfer framework to address these issues. It can\nrealize photorealistic 3D scene style transfer with a 2D style image. We first\npre-trained a 2D photorealistic style transfer network, which can meet the\nphotorealistic style transfer between any given content image and style image.\nThen, we use voxel features to optimize a 3D scene and get the geometric\nrepresentation of the scene. Finally, we jointly optimize a hyper network to\nrealize the scene photorealistic style transfer of arbitrary style images. In\nthe transfer stage, we use a pre-trained 2D photorealistic network to constrain\nthe photorealistic style of different views and different style images in the\n3D scene. The experimental results show that our method not only realizes the\n3D photorealistic style transfer of arbitrary style images but also outperforms\nthe existing methods in terms of visual quality and consistency.

    "abstract": "An authorisation has been recognised as an important security measure for\npreventing unauthorised access to critical resources, such as devices and data,\nwithin the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Existing authorisation methods\nfor the IoT network are based on traditional access control models, which have\nseveral drawbacks, including architecture centralisation, policy tampering,\naccess rights validation, malicious third-party policy assignment and control,\nand network-related overheads. The increasing trend of integrating Blockchain\ntechnology with IoT networks demonstrates its importance and potential to\naddress the shortcomings of traditional IoT network authorisation mechanisms.\nThis paper proposes a decentralised, secure, dynamic, and flexible\nauthorisation scheme for IoT networks based on attribute-based access control\n(ABAC) fine-grained policies stored on a distributed immutable ledger. We\ndesign a Blockchain-based ABAC policy management framework divided into\nAttribute Management Authority (AMA) and Policy Management Authority (PMA)\nframeworks that use smart contract features to initialise, store, and manage\nattributes and policies on the Blockchain. To achieve flexibility and\ndynamicity in the authorisation process, we capture and utilise the\nenvironmental-related attributes in conjunction with the subject and object\nattributes of the ABAC model to define the policies. Furthermore, we designed\nthe Blockchain-based Access Management Framework (AMF) to manage user requests\nto access IoT devices while maintaining the privacy and auditability of user\nrequests and assigned policies. We implemented a prototype of our proposed\nscheme and executed it on the local Ethereum Blockchain. Finally, we\ndemonstrated the applicability and flexibility of our proposed scheme for an\nIoT-based smart home scenario, taking into account deployment, execution and\nfinancial costs.",

The mechanical condition monitoring field has\nentered the big data phase as a result of the fast advancement of machine\nparts. When working with large amounts of data, the manual feature extraction\napproach has the drawback of being inefficient and inaccurate. Data-driven\nmethods like the Deep Learning method have been successfully used in recent\nyears for mechanical intelligent fault detection. Convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) were mostly used in earlier research to detect and identify bearing\nfaults. The CNN model, however, suffers from the drawback of having trouble\nmanaging fault-time information, which results in a lack of classification\nresults. In this study, bearing defects have been classified using a\nstate-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT). Bearing defects were classified\nusing Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing failure laboratory\nexperimental data. The research took into account 13 distinct kinds of defects\nunder 0-load situations in addition to normal bearing conditions. Using the\nshort-time Fourier transform (STFT), the vibration signals were converted into\n2D time-frequency images. The 2D time-frequency images are used as input\nparameters for the ViT.

The main\nchallenge resides in the need to identify from input utterances novel unseen\nin-tents. Herein, we propose Z-BERT-A, a two-stage method for intent discovery\nrelying on a Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al. 2017; Devlin et al.\n2018), fine-tuned with Adapters (Pfeiffer et al. 2020), initially trained for\nNatural Language Inference (NLI), and later applied for unknown in-tent\nclassification in a zero-shot setting. In our evaluation, we firstly analyze\nthe quality of the model after adaptive fine-tuning on known classes. Secondly,\nwe evaluate its performance casting intent classification as an NLI task.\nLastly, we test the zero-shot performance of the model on unseen classes,\nshowing how Z-BERT-A can effectively perform in-tent discovery by generating\nintents that are semantically similar, if not equal, to the ground truth ones.\nOur experiments show how Z-BERT-A is outperforming a wide variety of baselines\nin two zero-shot settings: known intents classification and unseen intent\ndiscovery.

However, the effectiveness of this method varies amongst individuals.\nTo solve this problem, it is necessary to provide more personalized support;\ntherefore, this study utilized a computational model of personal memory\nrecollection based on a cognitive architecture adaptive control of\nthought-rational (ACT-R). An ACT-R memory model reflecting the state of users\nis expected to facilitate personal recollection. In this study, we proposed a\nmethod for estimating the internal states of users through repeated\ninteractions with the memory model.

Through the repetition of these processes, the\nparameters of the model will reflect the internal states of the user. To\nconfirm the feasibility of the proposed method, we analyzed utterances of users\nwhen using a system that incorporates this model. The results confirmed the\nability of the method to estimate the memory retrieval parameters of the model\nfrom the utterances of the user. In addition, the ability of the method to\nestimate changes in the mood of the user caused by using the system was\nconfirmed.

Most works, however, focus on\nrelatively well-controlled conditions using, e.g., read speech. The performance\nmay degrade in more realistic situations. One of the factors causing such\ndegradation may be intrinsic speaker variability, such as emotions, occurring\ncommonly in realistic speech. In this paper, we investigate the influence of\nemotions on TSE and BSS. We create a new test dataset of emotional mixtures for\nthe evaluation of TSE and BSS. This dataset combines LibriSpeech and Ryerson\nAudio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS). Through\ncontrolled experiments, we can analyze the impact of different emotions on the\nperformance of BSS and TSE. We observe that BSS is relatively robust to\nemotions, while TSE, which requires identifying and extracting the speech of a\ntarget speaker, is much more sensitive to emotions. On comparative speaker\nverification experiments we show that identifying the target speaker may be\nparticularly challenging when dealing with emotional speech.

Through this experiment, we point out a\ndifferent line of thinking, time series, especially long-term forecasting, may\ndiffer from other fields. It is not necessary to use extensive and complex\nmodels to grasp all aspects of time series, but to use pure models to grasp the\ncore rules of time series changes.

On this basis,\nwe discuss the potential of pure linear layers in both phenomena and essence.\nThe ability to understand the core law contributes to the high precision of\nlong-distance prediction, and reasonable fluctuation prevents it from\ndistorting the curve in multi-step prediction like mainstream deep learning\nmodels, which is summarized as a pure linear neural network that avoids\nover-fluctuating.

    "title": "CAME: Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts for Unbiased Scene Graph  Generation",
    "abstract": "The scene graph generation has gained tremendous progress in recent years.\nHowever, its intrinsic long-tailed distribution of predicate classes is a\nchallenging problem. Almost all existing scene graph generation (SGG) methods\nfollow the same framework where they use a similar backbone network for object\ndetection and a customized network for scene graph generation. These methods\noften design the sophisticated context-encoder to extract the inherent\nrelevance of scene context w.r.t the intrinsic predicates and complicated\nnetworks to improve the learning capabilities of the network model for highly\nimbalanced data distributions. To address the unbiased SGG problem, we present\na simple yet effective method called Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (CAME) to\nimprove the model diversity and alleviate the biased SGG without a\nsophisticated design. Specifically, we propose to use the mixture of experts to\nremedy the heavily long-tailed distributions of predicate classes, which is\nsuitable for most unbiased scene graph generators. With a mixture of relation\nexperts, the long-tailed distribution of predicates is addressed in a divide\nand ensemble manner. As a result, the biased SGG is mitigated and the model\ntends to make more balanced predicates predictions. However, experts with the\nsame weight are not sufficiently diverse to discriminate the different levels\nof predicates distributions.

    "abstract": "With the development of streaming media technology, increasing communication\nrelies on sound and visual information, which puts a massive burden on online\nmedia. Data compression becomes increasingly important to reduce the volume of\ndata transmission and storage. To further improve the efficiency of image\ncompression, researchers utilize various image processing methods to compensate\nfor the limitations of conventional codecs and advanced learning-based\ncompression methods. Instead of modifying the image compression oriented\napproaches, we propose a unified image compression preprocessing framework,\ncalled Kuchen, which aims to further improve the performance of existing\ncodecs. The framework consists of a hybrid data labeling system along with a\nlearning-based backbone to simulate personalized preprocessing. As far as we\nknow, this is the first exploration of setting a unified preprocessing\nbenchmark in image compression tasks. Results demonstrate that the modern\ncodecs optimized by our unified preprocessing framework constantly improve the\nefficiency of the state-of-the-art compression.",

    "abstract": "Probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) is on track to become the de facto\ncoded modulation standard for communication systems aiming to operate close to\nchannel capacity at high transmission rates. The essential component of PAS\nthat breeds this widespread interest is the amplitude shaping block, through\nwhich the channel input distribution is controlled. This block is responsible\nfor converting bit strings into amplitude sequences with certain properties,\ne.g., fixed composition, limited energy, limited energy variation, etc.\nRecently, band-trellis enumerative sphere shaping (B-ESS) was introduced as an\namplitude shaping technique that achieves limited energy variations which is\nuseful in optical communication scenarios. B-ESS operates based on a trellis\ndiagram in which sequences with high energy variations are pruned. In this\nwork, we study the implementation of B-ESS. We first show that thanks to the\ntrellis structure obtained by this pruning, B-ESS can be implemented with very\nlow storage complexity. The trellis computation is shown to be reduced to a set\nof recursive multiplications with a scalar factor. Then we show that this\nscalar factor can be adjusted such that the trellis computation is further\nsimplified and realized with only binary shifts. This shift-based B-ESS (1) can\nbe implemented for arbitrarily long blocklengths without incurring an increase\nin complexity, and (2) can operate in a streaming mode similar to convolutional\ncoding.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a traffic demand management scheme, named CARMA, to\naddress the morning commute congestion with heterogeneous travelers. We\nintroduce karma as a non-tradable mobility credit used by the commuters to bid\nfor access to a fast lane that is kept in free-flow. Commuters who did not bid\nenough to enter the fast lane instead use a slow lane in which they might\nexperience congestion. At the end of each day, the karma spent by those\nentering the fast lane is evenly redistributed to all commuters, and this\nprocess repeats indefinitely. A core novelty of our approach is that we\ngeneralize the notion of Value Of Time (VOT) by allowing it to vary dynamically\neach day, e.g., as a function of the trip purpose, rather than being a static\ncharacteristic of each individual. This allows us to asses the efficiency and\nfairness of the system over the long-term instead of based on a single day. We\nformalize the recurrent interactions among self-interested commuters as a\ndynamic population game, and prove the existence of a Stationary Nash\nEquilibrium (SNE). We then investigate the performance of CARMA through three\nnumerical case studies with different assumptions on the heterogeneity in VOT.\nOur results demonstrate that CARMA closely approaches the efficiency of\nclassical optimal congestion pricing, while preventing individuals with a\nhigher (monetary) VOT from consistently taking advantage of the fast lane,\nthereby providing a fair and efficient solution to the bottleneck congestion.",

    "abstract": "Although large pre-trained models of code have delivered significant\nadvancements in various code processing tasks, there is an impediment to the\nwide and fluent adoption of these powerful models in software developers' daily\nworkflow: these large models consume hundreds of megabytes of memory and run\nslowly on personal devices, which causes problems in model deployment and\ngreatly degrades the user experience.\nIt motivates us to propose Compressor, a novel approach that can compress the\npre-trained models of code into extremely small models with negligible\nperformance sacrifice. Our proposed method formulates the design of tiny models\nas simplifying the pre-trained model architecture: searching for a\nsignificantly smaller model that follows an architectural design similar to the\noriginal pre-trained model. Compressor proposes a genetic algorithm (GA)-based\nstrategy to guide the simplification process. Prior studies found that a model\nwith higher computational cost tends to be more powerful. Inspired by this\ninsight, the GA algorithm is designed to maximize a model's Giga floating-point\noperations (GFLOPs), an indicator of the model computational cost, to satisfy\nthe constraint of the target model size. Then, we use the knowledge\ndistillation technique to train the small model: unlabelled data is fed into\nthe large model and the outputs are used as labels to train the small model. We\nevaluate Compressor with two state-of-the-art pre-trained models, i.e.,\nCodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT, on two important tasks, i.e., vulnerability\nprediction and clone detection. We use our method to compress pre-trained\nmodels to a size (3 MB), which is 160$\\times$ smaller than the original size.\nThe results show that compressed CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT are 4.31$\\times$\nand 4.15$\\times$ faster than the original model at inference, respectively.\nMore importantly, ...",

Compared with traditional\nparametric approaches (e.g., STRAIGHT and WORLD), neural vocoder based\nend-to-end models suffer from slow inference speed, and the synthesized speech\nis usually not robust and lack of controllability.

It represents a strongly NP-Hard optimization problem such that no\nsolution has been offered to date with high performance in space utilization.\nIn this paper, we present a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework for a\n3D-BPP solution for improving performance. First, a buffer is introduced to\nallow multi-item action selection. By increasing the degree of freedom in\naction selection, a more complex policy that results in better packing\nperformance can be derived. Second, we propose an agnostic data augmentation\nstrategy that exploits both bin item symmetries for improving sample\nefficiency. Third, we implement a model-based RL method adapted from the\npopular algorithm AlphaGo, which has shown superhuman performance in zero-sum\ngames. Our adaptation is capable of working in single-player and score based\nenvironments. In spite of the fact that AlphaGo versions are known to be\ncomputationally heavy, we manage to train the proposed framework with a single\nthread and GPU, while obtaining a solution that outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art results in space utilization.",

But a long sampling time is required\nfor this approach due to many timesteps for discretization. Schr\\\"odinger\nbridge (SB)-based models attempt to tackle this problem by training\nbidirectional stochastic processes between distributions. However, they still\nhave a slow sampling speed compared to generative models such as generative\nadversarial networks. And due to the training of the bidirectional stochastic\nprocesses, they require a relatively long training time.

Our approach achieves 1st\nplace on the leader-board of the ECCV 2022 WCPA challenge and our model is\nvisually robust under different identities, expressions and poses. The training\ncode and models are released to facilitate future research.",

The gradients of original evolutionary strategy are rescaled\nto reduce the estimation bias caused by the interaction between the multiple\nmissiles. Then, a hybrid co-evolutionary cooperative guidance law (HCCGL) is\nproposed by integrating the highly scalable co-evolutionary mechanism and the\ntraditional guidance strategy. Finally, three simulations under different\nconditions demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of this guidance law\nin solving cooperative guidance tasks with high accuracy.

The utilization of\ndeep learning, especially the deep generative models, offers aggressive\nacceleration and better reconstruction in magnetic resonance imaging.\nNevertheless, learning the data distribution as prior knowledge and\nreconstructing the image from limited data remains challenging. In this work,\nwe propose a novel Hankel-k-space generative model (HKGM), which can generate\nsamples from a training set of as little as one k-space data. At the prior\nlearning stage, we first construct a large Hankel matrix from k-space data,\nthen extract multiple structured k-space patches from the large Hankel matrix\nto capture the internal distribution among different patches. Extracting\npatches from a Hankel matrix enables the generative model to be learned from\nredundant and low-rank data space. At the iterative reconstruction stage, it is\nobserved that the desired solution obeys the learned prior knowledge. The\nintermediate reconstruction solution is updated by taking it as the input of\nthe generative model. The updated result is then alternatively operated by\nimposing low-rank penalty on its Hankel matrix and data consistency con-strain\non the measurement data. Experimental results confirmed that the internal\nstatistics of patches within a single k-space data carry enough information for\nlearning a powerful generative model and provide state-of-the-art\nreconstruction.",

The application of MKHE provides strong security guarantees against\nup to $N-2$ participates colluding with the aggregator, with no TTP required.\nTo mitigate the large computation and communication cost of MKHE, we leverage\nthe homomorphic property of SHPRG to replace the majority of MKHE computation\nby computationally-friendly mask generation from SHPRG, while preserving the\nsecurity.

    "title": "An Efficient and Reliable Asynchronous Federated Learning Scheme for  Smart Public Transportation",
    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is a distributed approach for training predictive\nmodels on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to enable smart public transportation.\nSince the traffic conditions change over time, the ML model that predicts\ntraffic flows and the time passengers wait at stops must be updated\ncontinuously and efficiently. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine\nlearning scheme that allows vehicles to receive continuous model updates\nwithout having to upload raw data to the cloud and wait for models to be\ntrained. However, FL in smart public transportation is vulnerable to poisoning\nor DDoS attacks since vehicles travel in public. Besides, due to device\nheterogeneity and imbalanced data distributions, the synchronized aggregation\nstrategy that collects local models from specific vehicles before aggregation\nis inefficient. Although Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) schemes are\ndeveloped to improve efficiency by aggregating local models as soon as they are\nreceived, the stale local models remain unreasonably weighted, resulting in\npoor learning performance. To enable smarter public transportation, this paper\noffers a blockchain-based asynchronous federated learning scheme with a dynamic\nscaling factor (DBAFL). Specifically, the novel committee-based consensus\nalgorithm for blockchain improves reliability at the lowest possible cost of\ntime. Meanwhile, the devised dynamic scaling factor allows AFL to assign\nreasonable weight to stale local models. Extensive experiments conducted on\nheterogeneous devices validate outperformed learning performance, efficiency,\nand reliability of DBAFL.",

    "title": "Determining HEDP Foams' Quality with Multi-View Deep Learning  Classification",
    "abstract": "High energy density physics (HEDP) experiments commonly involve a dynamic\nwave-front propagating inside a low-density foam. This effect affects its\ndensity and hence, its transparency. A common problem in foam production is the\ncreation of defective foams. Accurate information on their dimension and\nhomogeneity is required to classify the foams' quality. Therefore, those\nparameters are being characterized using a 3D-measuring laser confocal\nmicroscope. For each foam, five images are taken: two 2D images representing\nthe top and bottom surface foam planes and three images of side cross-sections\nfrom 3D scannings. An expert has to do the complicated, harsh, and exhausting\nwork of manually classifying the foam's quality through the image set and only\nthen determine whether the foam can be used in experiments or not. Currently,\nquality has two binary levels of normal vs. defective. At the same time,\nexperts are commonly required to classify a sub-class of normal-defective,\ni.e., foams that are defective but might be sufficient for the needed\nexperiment. This sub-class is problematic due to inconclusive judgment that is\nprimarily intuitive. In this work, we present a novel state-of-the-art\nmulti-view deep learning classification model that mimics the physicist's\nperspective by automatically determining the foams' quality classification and\nthus aids the expert. Our model achieved 86\\% accuracy on upper and lower\nsurface foam planes and 82\\% on the entire set, suggesting interesting\nheuristics to the problem. A significant added value in this work is the\nability to regress the foam quality instead of binary deduction and even\nexplain the decision visually.

    "title": "On The Complexity of Distance-$d$ Independent Set Reconfiguration",
    "abstract": "For a fixed positive integer $d \\geq 2$, a distance-$d$ independent set\n(D$d$IS) of a graph is a vertex subset whose distance between any two members\nis at least $d$. Imagine that there is a token placed on each member of a\nD$d$IS. Two D$d$ISs are adjacent under Token Sliding ($\\mathsf{TS}$) if one can\nbe obtained from the other by moving a token from one vertex to one of its\nunoccupied adjacent vertices. Under Token Jumping ($\\mathsf{TJ}$), the target\nvertex needs not to be adjacent to the original one. The Distance-$d$\nIndependent Set Reconfiguration (D$d$ISR) problem under\n$\\mathsf{TS}/\\mathsf{TJ}$ asks if there is a corresponding sequence of adjacent\nD$d$ISs that transforms one given D$d$IS into another. The problem for $d = 2$,\nalso known as the Independent Set Reconfiguration problem, has been\nwell-studied in the literature and its computational complexity on several\ngraph classes has been known. In this paper, we study the computational\ncomplexity of D$d$ISR on different graphs under $\\mathsf{TS}$ and $\\mathsf{TJ}$\nfor any fixed $d \\geq 3$. On chordal graphs, we show that D$d$ISR under\n$\\mathsf{TJ}$ is in $\\mathtt{P}$ when $d$ is even and\n$\\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete when $d$ is odd. On split graphs, there is an\ninteresting complexity dichotomy: D$d$ISR is $\\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete for $d\n= 2$ but in $\\mathtt{P}$ for $d=3$ under $\\mathsf{TS}$, while under\n$\\mathsf{TJ}$ it is in $\\mathtt{P}$ for $d = 2$ but $\\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete\nfor $d = 3$. Additionally, certain well-known hardness results for $d = 2$ on\ngeneral graphs, perfect graphs, planar graphs of maximum degeree three and\nbounded bandwidth can be extended for $d \\geq 3$.",

OX\nfunction specifications are thus incompatible with true bug-finding supported\nby symbolic execution tools such as Pulse and Gillian. In contrast,\nunder-approximating (UX) program logics, such as incorrectness separation\nlogic, are used to find true results and bugs: reported results and errors are\nreachable, but not all behaviour can be characterised. UX function\nspecifications thus cannot capture full verification.\nWe introduce exact separation logic (ESL), which provides fully verified\nfunction specifications compatible with true bug finding: all terminating\nbehaviour is characterised, and all reported results and errors are reachable.\nESL requires subtle definitions of internal and external function\nspecifications compared with the familiar definitions of OX logics. It supports\nreasoning about mutually recursive functions and non-termination. We prove\nframe-preserving soundness for ESL, demonstrating, for the first time,\nfunctional compositionality for a non-OX program logic. We investigate the\nexpressivity of ESL and the role of abstraction in UX reasoning by verifying\nabstract ESL specifications of list algorithms.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to many\nreal-world static graphs. However, the success of static graphs has not fully\ntranslated to dynamic graphs due to the limitations in model design, evaluation\nsettings, and training strategies. Concretely, existing dynamic GNNs do not\nincorporate state-of-the-art designs from static GNNs, which limits their\nperformance. Current evaluation settings for dynamic GNNs do not fully reflect\nthe evolving nature of dynamic graphs. Finally, commonly used training methods\nfor dynamic GNNs are not scalable. Here we propose ROLAND, an effective graph\nrepresentation learning framework for real-world dynamic graphs. At its core,\nthe ROLAND framework can help researchers easily repurpose any static GNN to\ndynamic graphs. Our insight is to view the node embeddings at different GNN\nlayers as hierarchical node states and then recurrently update them over time.\nWe then introduce a live-update evaluation setting for dynamic graphs that\nmimics real-world use cases, where GNNs are making predictions and being\nupdated on a rolling basis. Finally, we propose a scalable and efficient\ntraining approach for dynamic GNNs via incremental training and meta-learning.\nWe conduct experiments over eight different dynamic graph datasets on future\nlink prediction tasks. Models built using the ROLAND framework achieve on\naverage 62.7% relative mean reciprocal rank (MRR) improvement over\nstate-of-the-art baselines under the standard evaluation settings on three\ndatasets. We find state-of-the-art baselines experience out-of-memory errors\nfor larger datasets, while ROLAND can easily scale to dynamic graphs with 56\nmillion edges. After re-implementing these baselines using the ROLAND training\nstrategy, ROLAND models still achieve on average 15.5% relative MRR improvement\nover the baselines.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimisation (BO) has been widely used to solve problems with\nexpensive function evaluations. In multi-objective optimisation problems, BO\naims to find a set of approximated Pareto optimal solutions. There are\ntypically two ways to build surrogates in multi-objective BO: One surrogate by\naggregating objective functions (by using a scalarising function, also called\nmono-surrogate approach) and multiple surrogates (for each objective function,\nalso called multi-surrogate approach). In both approaches, an acquisition\nfunction (AF) is used to guide the search process. Mono-surrogate has the\nadvantage that only one model is used, however, the approach has two major\nlimitations. Firstly, the fitness landscape of the scalarising function and the\nobjective functions may not be similar. Secondly, the approach assumes that the\nscalarising function distribution is Gaussian, and thus a closed-form\nexpression of the AF can be used. In this work, we overcome these limitations\nby building a surrogate model for each objective function and show that the\nscalarising function distribution is not Gaussian. We approximate the\ndistribution using Generalised extreme value distribution. The results and\ncomparison with existing approaches on standard benchmark and real-world\noptimisation problems show the potential of the multi-surrogate approach.",

Our method, dubbed HEFT\n(Homomorphically Encrypted Fusion of biometric Templates), is custom-designed\nto overcome the unique constraint imposed by FHE, namely the lack of support\nfor non-arithmetic operations. From an inference perspective, we systematically\nexplore different data packing schemes for computationally efficient linear\nprojection and introduce a polynomial approximation for scale normalization.\nFrom a training perspective, we introduce an FHE-aware algorithm for learning\nthe linear projection matrix to mitigate errors induced by approximate\nnormalization.

    "abstract": "A common yet potentially dangerous task is the act of crossing the street.\nPedestrian accidents contribute a significant amount to the high number of\nannual traffic casualties, which is why it is crucial for pedestrians to use\nsafety measures such as a crosswalk. However, people often forget to activate a\ncrosswalk light or are unable to do so -- such as those who are visually\nimpaired or have occupied hands. Other pedestrians are simply careless and find\nthe crosswalk signals a hassle, which can result in an accident where a car\nhits them. In this paper, we consider an improvement to the crosswalk system by\ndesigning a system that can detect pedestrians and triggering the crosswalk\nsignal automatically. We collect a dataset of images that we then use to train\na convolutional neural network to distinguish between pedestrians (including\nbicycle riders) and various false alarms. The resulting system can capture and\nevaluate images in real time, and the result can be used to automatically\nactivate systems a crosswalk light. After extensive testing of our system in\nreal-world environments, we conclude that it is feasible as a back-up system\nthat can compliment existing crosswalk buttons, and thereby improve the overall\nsafety of crossing the street.",

The continuous and differentiable\nproperties of the solution space spanned by the additive Gaussian noise model\nare used as a heuristic that generates meaningful estimates of layer robustness\nwithout the need for combinatorial optimization techniques. Instead, the amount\nof noise injected into the accurate computations is learned during network\ntraining using backpropagation. A probabilistic model of the multiplier error\nis presented to bridge the gap between the domains; the model estimates the\nstandard deviation of the approximate multiplier error, connecting solutions in\nthe additive Gaussian noise space to actual hardware instances.

It achieves comparable\nperformance to previous work on easy SMAC scenarios and outperforms other\ntechniques on hard scenarios, as well as scenarios that are corrupted with\nGaussian noise to simulate fog of war.",

    "title": "A Simulation Study of Passing Drivers' Responses to the Automated  Truck-Mounted Attenuator System in Road Maintenance",
    "abstract": "The Autonomous Truck-Mounted Attenuator (ATMA) system is a lead-follower\nvehicle system based on autonomous driving and connected vehicle technologies.\nThe lead truck performs maintenance tasks on the road, and the unmanned\nfollower truck is designed to improve the visibility of the moving work zone to\npassing vehicles and to protect workers and equipment. While the ATMA has been\nunder testing by transportation maintenance and operations agencies in recent\nyears, a simulator-based testing capability is a supplement, especially if\nhuman subjects are involved. This paper aims to discover how passing drivers\nperceive, understand, and react to the ATMA system in road maintenance\naccordingly. A driving simulator for ATMA studies is developed for collecting\nthe driving data. Then, driving simulation experiments were performed, wherein\na screen-based eye tracker collected sixteen subjects' gaze points and pupil\ndiameters. Data analysis has evidenced the changes in the visual attention\npattern of subjects when they were passing the ATMA. On average, the ATMA\nstarts to attract subjects' attention from 500 ft behind the follower truck.\nMost (87.50%) understood the follower truck's protection purpose, and the\nmajority (86.67%) reasoned the association between the two trucks. But still,\nmany (43.75%) did not recognize that ATMA is a connected autonomous vehicle\nsystem. While all subjects safely changed lanes and attempted to pass the\nslow-moving ATMA, their inadequate understanding of ATMA is a potential risk,\nlike cutting into the ATAM. Results implied that transportation maintenance and\noperations agencies should take this into consideration in establishing the\ndeployment guidance.",

    "title": "Towards Robust On-Ramp Merging via Augmented Multimodal Reinforcement  Learning",
    "abstract": "Despite the success of AI-enabled onboard perception, on-ramp merging has\nbeen one of the main challenges for autonomous driving. Due to limited sensing\nrange of onboard sensors, a merging vehicle can hardly observe main road\nconditions and merge properly. By leveraging the wireless communications\nbetween connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), a merging CAV has potential to\nproactively obtain the intentions of nearby vehicles. However, CAVs can be\nprone to inaccurate observations, such as the noisy basic safety messages (BSM)\nand poor quality surveillance images. In this paper, we present a novel\napproach for Robust on-ramp merge of CAVs via Augmented and Multi-modal\nReinforcement Learning, named by RAMRL. Specifically, we formulate the on-ramp\nmerging problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) by taking driving safety,\ncomfort driving behavior, and traffic efficiency into account. To provide\nreliable merging maneuvers, we simultaneously leverage BSM and surveillance\nimages for multi-modal observation, which is used to learn a policy model\nthrough proximal policy optimization (PPO). Moreover, to improve data\nefficiency and provide better generalization performance, we train the policy\nmodel with augmented data (e.g., noisy BSM and noisy surveillance images).\nExtensive experiments are conducted with Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO)\nplatform under two typical merging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of our robust on-ramp merging design.",

    "abstract": "Multi-instance learning (MIL) is widely used in the computer-aided\ninterpretation of pathological Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to solve the lack of\npixel-wise or patch-wise annotations. Often, this approach directly applies\n\"natural image driven\" MIL algorithms which overlook the multi-scale (i.e.\npyramidal) nature of WSIs. Off-the-shelf MIL algorithms are typically deployed\non a single-scale of WSIs (e.g., 20x magnification), while human pathologists\nusually aggregate the global and local patterns in a multi-scale manner (e.g.,\nby zooming in and out between different magnifications). In this study, we\npropose a novel cross-scale attention mechanism to explicitly aggregate\ninter-scale interactions into a single MIL network for Crohn's Disease (CD),\nwhich is a form of inflammatory bowel disease. The contribution of this paper\nis two-fold: (1) a cross-scale attention mechanism is proposed to aggregate\nfeatures from different resolutions with multi-scale interaction; and (2)\ndifferential multi-scale attention visualizations are generated to localize\nexplainable lesion patterns. By training ~250,000 H&E-stained Ascending Colon\n(AC) patches from 20 CD patient and 30 healthy control samples at different\nscales, our approach achieved a superior Area under the Curve (AUC) score of\n0.8924 compared with baseline models.

    "abstract": "Large language models have been widely adopted but require significant GPU\nmemory for inference. We develop a procedure for Int8 matrix multiplication for\nfeed-forward and attention projection layers in transformers, which cut the\nmemory needed for inference by half while retaining full precision performance.\nWith our method, a 175B parameter 16/32-bit checkpoint can be loaded, converted\nto Int8, and used immediately without performance degradation. This is made\npossible by understanding and working around properties of highly systematic\nemergent features in transformer language models that dominate attention and\ntransformer predictive performance. To cope with these features, we develop a\ntwo-part quantization procedure, LLM.int8(). We first use vector-wise\nquantization with separate normalization constants for each inner product in\nthe matrix multiplication, to quantize most of the features. However, for the\nemergent outliers, we also include a new mixed-precision decomposition scheme,\nwhich isolates the outlier feature dimensions into a 16-bit matrix\nmultiplication while still more than 99.9% of values are multiplied in 8-bit.\nUsing LLM.int8(), we show empirically it is possible to perform inference in\nLLMs with up to 175B parameters without any performance degradation.

These algorithms tend to prioritize the\nplatforms' short-term goals by featuring items with the highest popularity.\nHowever, this practice can then lead to too little visibility for the rest of\nthe items, making them leave the platform, and in turn hurting the platform's\nlong-term goals. Motivated by that, we introduce and study a fair assortment\nplanning problem, which requires any two items with similar merits\n(popularities) to be offered similar visibility. We show that the problem can\nbe formulated as a linear program (LP), called (FAIR), that optimizes over the\ndistribution of all feasible assortments. To find a near-optimal solution to\n(FAIR), we propose a framework based on the Ellipsoid method, which requires a\npolynomial-time separation oracle to the dual of the LP. We show that finding\nan optimal separation oracle to the dual problem is an NP-complete problem, and\nhence we propose two approximate separation oracles: a 1/2-approx. algorithm\nand an FPTAS. The approximate separation oracles result in a polynomial-time\n1/2-approx. algorithm and an FPTAS for the original problem (FAIR) using the\nEllipsoid method. Further, they are designed by (i) showing the separation\noracle to the dual of the LP is equivalent to solving an infinite series of\nparameterized knapsack problems, and (ii) taking advantage of the structure of\nthe parameterized knapsack problems.

We\ndevelop a centralized scheduler that is stable if a transaction generation rate\nis at most $\\max\\bigl\\{\\frac{1}{4k}, \\frac{1}{4\\lceil\\sqrt{m}\\rceil} \\bigr\\}$.\nWe design a distributed scheduler in the queue-based model of transaction\nautonomy, in which a transaction is assigned to an individual processor, that\nguarantees stability if the rate of transaction generation is less than\n$\\max\\bigl\\{ \\frac{1}{6k},\\frac{1}{6\\lceil\\sqrt{m}\\rceil}\\bigr\\}$. For each of\nthe schedulers we give upper bounds on the queue size and transaction latency\nin the range of rates of transaction generation for which the scheduler is\nstable.",

Nonetheless, they are also challenging to control, as a policy\nmust drive an unstable, discontinuous, and high-dimensional physical system.\nOne widely studied approach is to utilize motion capture (MoCap) data to teach\nthe humanoid agent low-level skills (e.g., standing, walking, and running) that\ncan then be re-used to synthesize high-level behaviors. However, even with\nMoCap data, controlling simulated humanoids remains very hard, as MoCap data\noffers only kinematic information. Finding physical control inputs to realize\nthe demonstrated motions requires computationally intensive methods like\nreinforcement learning. Thus, despite the publicly available MoCap data, its\nutility has been limited to institutions with large-scale compute. In this\nwork, we dramatically lower the barrier for productive research on this topic\nby training and releasing high-quality agents that can track over three hours\nof MoCap data for a simulated humanoid in the dm_control physics-based\nenvironment. We release MoCapAct (Motion Capture with Actions), a dataset of\nthese expert agents and their rollouts, which contain proprioceptive\nobservations and actions. We demonstrate the utility of MoCapAct by using it to\ntrain a single hierarchical policy capable of tracking the entire MoCap dataset\nwithin dm_control and show the learned low-level component can be re-used to\nefficiently learn downstream high-level tasks. Finally, we use MoCapAct to\ntrain an autoregressive GPT model and show that it can control a simulated\nhumanoid to perform natural motion completion given a motion prompt.\nVideos of the results and links to the code and dataset are available at\nhttps://microsoft.github.io/MoCapAct.",

Instead, holistic multi-energy system models\ncan serve to improve the understanding of these interdependent systems and\nguide policies that shape the systems as they evolve into the future. The NSF\nproject entitled \"American Multi-Modal Energy System Synthetic \\& Simulated\nData (AMES-3D)\" seeks to fill this void with an open-source,\nphysically-informed, structural and behavioral machine-learning model of the\nAMES. To that end, this paper uses a GIS-data-driven, model-based system\nengineering approach to develop structural models of the American Multi-Modal\nEnergy System (AMES). This paper produces and reports the hetero-functional\nincidence tensor, hetero-functional adjacency matrix, and the formal graph\nadjacency matrix in terms of their statistics. This work compares these four\nhetero-functional graph models across the states of New York (NY), California\n(CA), Texas (TX), and the United States of America (USA) as a whole.

In this paper, an advanced consistency-aware\npseudo-label-based self-ensembling approach is presented to fully utilize the\npower of Vision Transformer(ViT) and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) in\nsemi-supervised learning. Our proposed framework consists of a feature-learning\nmodule which is enhanced by ViT and CNN mutually, and a guidance module which\nis robust for consistency-aware purposes. The pseudo labels are inferred and\nutilized recurrently and separately by views of CNN and ViT in the\nfeature-learning module to expand the data set and are beneficial to each\nother. Meanwhile, a perturbation scheme is designed for the feature-learning\nmodule, and averaging network weight is utilized to develop the guidance\nmodule. By doing so, the framework combines the feature-learning strength of\nCNN and ViT, strengthens the performance via dual-view co-training, and enables\nconsistency-aware supervision in a semi-supervised manner. A topological\nexploration of all alternative supervision modes with CNN and ViT are detailed\nvalidated, demonstrating the most promising performance and specific setting of\nour method on semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks.

The reported device consists of a 250 $\\mu$m\n$\\times$ 30 $\\mu$m unimorph cantilever with 20 nm thick ferroelectric HZO on 1\n$\\mu$m $SiO_2$.Partial ferroelectric switching in HZO achieves analog\nprogrammable control of the piezoelectric coefficient ($d_{31}$) which serves\nas the computational weight for multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. The\ndisplacement of the piezoelectric unimorph was recorded by actuating the device\nwith different input voltages $V_{in}$. The resulting displacement was measured\nas a function of the ferroelectric programming/poling voltage $V_p$. The slopes\nof central beam displacement ($\\delta_{max}$) vs $V_{in}$ were measured to be\nbetween 182.9nm/V (for -8 $V_p$) and -90.5nm/V (for 8 $V_p$), demonstrating\nthat $V_p$ can be used to change the direction of motion of the beam. The\nresultant ($\\delta_{max}$) from AC actuation is in the range of -18 to 36 nm\nand is a scaled product of the input voltage and programmed $d_{31}$ (governed\nby the $V_p$). The multiplication function serves as the fundamental unit for\nMAC operations with the ferroelectric NEMS unimorph. The displacement from many\nsuch beams can be added by summing the capacitance changes, providing a pathway\nto implement a multi-input and multi-weight neuron.

    "abstract": "With a rapidly rising number of transients detected in astronomy,\nclassification methods based on machine learning are increasingly being\nemployed. Their goals are typically to obtain a definitive classification of\ntransients, and for good performance they usually require the presence of a\nlarge set of observations. However, well-designed, targeted models can reach\ntheir classification goals with fewer computing resources. This paper presents\nSNGuess, a model designed to find young extragalactic nearby transients with\nhigh purity. SNGuess works with a set of features that can be efficiently\ncalculated from astronomical alert data. Some of these features are static and\nassociated with the alert metadata, while others must be calculated from the\nphotometric observations contained in the alert. Most of the features are\nsimple enough to be obtained or to be calculated already at the early stages in\nthe lifetime of a transient after its detection. We calculate these features\nfor a set of labeled public alert data obtained over a time span of 15 months\nfrom the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The core model of SNGuess consists of\nan ensemble of decision trees, which are trained via gradient boosting.\nApproximately 88% of the candidates suggested by SNGuess from a set of alerts\nfrom ZTF spanning from April 2020 to August 2021 were found to be true relevant\nsupernovae (SNe). For alerts with bright detections, this number ranges between\n92% and 98%. Since April 2020, transients identified by SNGuess as potential\nyoung SNe in the ZTF alert stream are being published to the Transient Name\nServer (TNS) under the AMPEL_ZTF_NEW group identifier. SNGuess scores for any\ntransient observed by ZTF can be accessed via a web service. The source code of\nSNGuess is publicly available.",

For example, inverse Kalman filter\n(I-KF) has been recently formulated to estimate the adversary's Kalman filter\ntracked estimates and hence, predict the adversary's future steps. The purpose\nof this paper and the companion paper (Part I) is to address the inverse\nfiltering problem in non-linear systems by proposing an inverse extended Kalman\nfilter (I-EKF). In a companion paper (Part I), we developed the theory of I-EKF\n(with and without unknown inputs) and I-KF (with unknown inputs). In this\npaper, we develop this theory for highly non-linear models, which employ\nsecond-order, Gaussian sum, and dithered forward EKFs. In particular, we derive\ntheoretical stability guarantees for the inverse second-order EKF using the\nbounded non-linearity approach. To address the limitation of the standard\nI-EKFs that the system model and forward filter are perfectly known to the\ndefender, we propose reproducing kernel Hilbert space-based EKF to learn the\nunknown system dynamics based on its observations, which can be employed as an\ninverse filter to infer the adversary's estimate.

Methods; We\nretrospectively studied 57 glioma patients with pre and postcontrast T1\nweighted, T2 weighted, FLAIR images, and ADC maps acquired on a 3T MRI. The\ntumors were segmented into enhancing and nonenhancing portions, tumor necrosis,\ncyst and edema using semiautomated segmentation of ITK-SNAP open source tool.\nWe measured total tumor volume, enhancing-nonenhancing tumor, edema, necrosis\nvolume and the ratios to the total tumor volume. Training of a support vector\nmachine (SVM) classifier and artificial neural network (ANN) was performed with\nlabeled data designed to answer the question of interest. Specificity,\nsensitivity, and AUC of the predictions were computed by means of ROC analysis.\nDifferences in continuous measures between groups were assessed by using\nKruskall Wallis, with post hoc Dunn correction for multiple comparisons.\nResults; When we compared the volume ratios between groups, there was\nstatistically significant difference between grade IV and grade II-III glial\ntumors. Edema and tumor necrosis volume ratios for grade IV glial tumors were\nhigher than that of grade II and III. Volumetric ratio analysis could not\ndistinguish grade II and III tumors successfully. However, SVM and ANN\ncorrectly classified each group with accuracies up to 98% and 96%.

Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can potentially address\nthe shortage of pathologists in ROSE. However, the cancerous patterns vary\nsignificantly between different samples, making the CAD task extremely\nchallenging. Besides, the ROSE images have complicated perturbations regarding\ncolor distribution, brightness, and contrast due to different staining\nqualities and various acquisition device types.

As there are far fewer majority graphs or weighted majority\ngraphs than there are preference profiles (for a bounded number of candidates\nand voters), computer-aided techniques such as satisfiability solving become\npractical for proving results about C1 and pairwise methods. In this paper, we\ndevelop an approach to generalizing impossibility theorems proved for C1 or\npairwise voting methods to impossibility theorems covering all voting methods.\nWe apply this approach to impossibility theorems involving \"variable candidate\"\naxioms--in particular, social choice versions of Sen's well-known $\\gamma$ and\n$\\alpha$ axioms for individual choice--which concern what happens when a\ncandidate is added or removed from an election.

    "abstract": "The time-marching strategy, which propagates the solution from one time step\nto the next, is a natural strategy for solving time-dependent differential\nequations on classical computers, as well as for solving the Hamiltonian\nsimulation problem on quantum computers. For more general linear differential\nequations, a time-marching based quantum solver can suffer from exponentially\nvanishing success probability with respect to the number of time steps and is\nthus considered impractical. We solve this problem by repeatedly invoking a\ntechnique called the uniform singular value amplification, and the overall\nsuccess probability can be lower bounded by a quantity that is independent of\nthe number of time steps. The success probability can be further improved using\na compression gadget lemma. This provides a path of designing quantum\ndifferential equation solvers that is alternative to those based on quantum\nlinear systems algorithms (QLSA). We demonstrate the performance of the\ntime-marching strategy with a high-order integrator based on the truncated\nDyson series. The complexity of the algorithm depends linearly on the\namplification ratio, which quantifies the deviation from a unitary dynamics. We\nprove that the linear dependence on the amplification ratio attains the query\ncomplexity lower bound and thus cannot be improved in general. This algorithm\nalso surpasses existing QLSA based solvers in three aspects: (1) the\ncoefficient matrix $A(t)$ does not need to be diagonalizable. (2) $A(t)$ can be\nnon-smooth, and is only of bounded variation. (3) It can use fewer queries to\nthe initial state. Finally, we demonstrate the time-marching strategy with a\nfirst-order truncated Magnus series, while retaining the aforementioned\nbenefits. Our analysis also raises some open questions concerning the\ndifferences between time-marching and QLSA based methods for solving\ndifferential equations.",

The proposed algorithm is\ngeneralized, via the devised mapping, for better learning weight adjustments on\nfavourable/unfavourable actions and its effectiveness is verified via\nsimulation.",

    "abstract": "Over the decades, the Markowitz framework has been used extensively in\nportfolio analysis though it puts too much emphasis on the analysis of the\nmarket uncertainty rather than on the trend prediction. While generative\nadversarial network (GAN), conditional GAN (CGAN), and autoencoding CGAN\n(ACGAN) have been explored to generate financial time series and extract\nfeatures that can help portfolio analysis. The limitation of the CGAN or ACGAN\nframework stands in putting too much emphasis on generating series and finding\nthe internal trends of the series rather than predicting the future trends. In\nthis paper, we introduce a hybrid approach on conditional GAN based on deep\ngenerative models that learns the internal trend of historical data while\nmodeling market uncertainty and future trends. We evaluate the model on several\nreal-world datasets from both the US and Europe markets, and show that the\nproposed HybridCGAN and HybridACGAN models lead to better portfolio allocation\ncompared to the existing Markowitz, CGAN, and ACGAN approaches.",

A single hollow metal main waveguide feed is used to couple\npower to each of the branch waveguide. Carefully oriented slots control both\nthe magnitude and phase of the field distributed from the main feed to each\nbranch. All waveguides can be machined from a single block of metal, with a\nmetamaterial-patterned printed circuit board laminated to the top of the\nassembly.

    "abstract": "Pharmaceutical companies operate in a strictly regulated and highly risky\nenvironment in which a single slip can lead to serious financial implications.\nAccordingly, the announcements of clinical trial results tend to determine the\nfuture course of events, hence being closely monitored by the public. In this\nwork, we provide statistical evidence for the result promulgation influence on\nthe public pharma market value. Whereas most works focus on retrospective\nimpact analysis, the present research aims to predict the numerical values of\nannouncement-induced changes in stock prices. For this purpose, we develop a\npipeline that includes a BERT-based model for extracting sentiment polarity of\nannouncements, a Temporal Fusion Transformer for forecasting the expected\nreturn, a graph convolution network for capturing event relationships, and\ngradient boosting for predicting the price change. The challenge of the problem\nlies in inherently different patterns of responses to positive and negative\nannouncements, reflected in a stronger and more pronounced reaction to the\nnegative news. Moreover, such phenomenon as the drop in stocks after the\npositive announcements affirms the counterintuitiveness of the price behavior.\nImportantly, we discover two crucial factors that should be considered while\nworking within a predictive framework. The first factor is the drug portfolio\nsize of the company, indicating the greater susceptibility to an announcement\nin the case of small drug diversification. The second one is the network effect\nof the events related to the same company or nosology. All findings and\ninsights are gained on the basis of one of the biggest FDA (the Food and Drug\nAdministration) announcement datasets, consisting of 5436 clinical trial\nannouncements from 681 companies over the last five years.",

Due to the increasing popularity of\ncryptocurrencies in recent years, the question has arisen, as to whether market\ninefficiencies could be exploited in Bitcoin. Several studies we refer to here\ndiscuss this topic in the context of Bitcoin using either statistical tests or\nmachine learning methods, mostly relying exclusively on data from Bitcoin\nitself. Results regarding market efficiency vary from study to study. In this\nstudy, however, the focus is on applying various asset-related input features\nin a neural network. The aim is to investigate whether the prediction accuracy\nimproves when adding equity stock indices (S&P 500, Russell 2000), currencies\n(EURUSD), 10 Year US Treasury Note Yield as well as Gold&Silver producers index\n(XAU), in addition to using Bitcoin returns as input feature. As expected, the\nresults show that more features lead to higher training performance from 54.6%\nprediction accuracy with one feature to 61% with six features. On the test set,\nwe observe that with our neural network methodology, adding additional asset\nclasses, no increase in prediction accuracy is achieved. One feature set is\nable to partially outperform a buy-and-hold strategy, but the performance drops\nagain as soon as another feature is added. This leads us to the partial\nconclusion that weak market inefficiencies for Bitcoin cannot be detected using\nneural networks and the given asset classes as input. Therefore, based on this\nstudy, we find evidence that the Bitcoin market is efficient in the sense of\nthe efficient market hypothesis during the sample period. We encourage further\nresearch in this area, as much depends on the sample period chosen, the input\nfeatures, the model architecture, and the hyperparameters.",

The online course was divided into consecutive lessons, which\ninclude theory in the form of explanatory videos, practical exercises in the\nform of Streamlit and practical exercises and/or quizzes to check learning\nprogress. A survey among the participating medical students in the first run of\nthe course was used to analyse our research hypotheses quantitatively.",

    "title": "Predicting from Predictions",
    "abstract": "Predictions about people, such as their expected educational achievement or\ntheir credit risk, can be performative and shape the outcome that they aim to\npredict. Understanding the causal effect of these predictions on the eventual\noutcomes is crucial for foreseeing the implications of future predictive models\nand selecting which models to deploy. However, this causal estimation task\nposes unique challenges: model predictions are usually deterministic functions\nof input features and highly correlated with outcomes, which can make the\ncausal effects of predictions impossible to disentangle from the direct effect\nof the covariates. We study this problem through the lens of causal\nidentifiability, and despite the hardness of this problem in full generality,\nwe highlight three natural scenarios where the causal effect of predictions on\noutcomes can be identified from observational data: randomization in\npredictions or prediction-based decisions, overparameterization of the\npredictive model deployed during data collection, and discrete prediction\noutputs. We show empirically that, under suitable identifiability conditions,\nstandard variants of supervised learning that predict from predictions can find\ntransferable functional relationships between features, predictions, and\noutcomes, allowing for conclusions about newly deployed prediction models. Our\npositive results fundamentally rely on model predictions being recorded during\ndata collection, bringing forward the importance of rethinking standard data\ncollection practices to enable progress towards a better understanding of\nsocial outcomes and performative feedback loops.",

    "title": "Domain-aware Control-oriented Neural Models for Autonomous Underwater  Vehicles",
    "abstract": "Conventional physics-based modeling is a time-consuming bottleneck in control\ndesign for complex nonlinear systems like autonomous underwater vehicles\n(AUVs). In contrast, purely data-driven models, though convenient and quick to\nobtain, require a large number of observations and lack operational guarantees\nfor safety-critical systems. Data-driven models leveraging available partially\ncharacterized dynamics have potential to provide reliable systems models in a\ntypical data-limited scenario for high value complex systems, thereby avoiding\nmonths of expensive expert modeling time. In this work we explore this\nmiddle-ground between expert-modeled and pure data-driven modeling. We present\ncontrol-oriented parametric models with varying levels of domain-awareness that\nexploit known system structure and prior physics knowledge to create\nconstrained deep neural dynamical system models. We employ universal\ndifferential equations to construct data-driven blackbox and graybox\nrepresentations of the AUV dynamics. In addition, we explore a hybrid\nformulation that explicitly models the residual error related to imperfect\ngraybox models. We compare the prediction performance of the learned models for\ndifferent distributions of initial conditions and control inputs to assess\ntheir accuracy, generalization, and suitability for control.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the spread of COVID-19 has been the subject of numerous\nstudies, highlighting the significance of reliable epidemic models. Here, we\nintroduce a novel epidemic model using a latent Hawkes process with temporal\ncovariates for modelling the infections. Unlike other models, we model the\nreported cases via a probability distribution driven by the underlying Hawkes\nprocess. Modelling the infections via a Hawkes process allows us to estimate by\nwhom an infected individual was infected. We propose a Kernel Density Particle\nFilter (KDPF) for inference of both latent cases and reproduction number and\nfor predicting the new cases in the near future. The computational effort is\nproportional to the number of infections making it possible to use particle\nfilter type algorithms, such as the KDPF. We demonstrate the performance of the\nproposed algorithm on synthetic data sets and COVID-19 reported cases in\nvarious local authorities in the UK, and benchmark our model to alternative\napproaches.",
