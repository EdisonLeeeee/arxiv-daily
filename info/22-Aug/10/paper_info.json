    "title": "AUTOSHAPE: An Autoencoder-Shapelet Approach for Time Series Clustering",
    "abstract": "Time series shapelets are discriminative subsequences that have been recently\nfound effective for time series clustering (TSC). The shapelets are convenient\nfor interpreting the clusters. Thus, the main challenge for TSC is to discover\nhigh-quality variable-length shapelets to discriminate different clusters. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel autoencoder-shapelet approach (AUTOSHAPE), which\nis the first study to take the advantage of both autoencoder and shapelet for\ndetermining shapelets in an unsupervised manner. An autoencoder is specially\ndesigned to learn high-quality shapelets. More specifically, for guiding the\nlatent representation learning, we employ the latest self-supervised loss to\nlearn the unified embeddings for variable-length shapelet candidates (time\nseries subsequences) of different variables, and propose the diversity loss to\nselect the discriminating embeddings in the unified space. We introduce the\nreconstruction loss to recover shapelets in the original time series space for\nclustering. Finally, we adopt Davies Bouldin index (DBI) to inform AUTOSHAPE of\nthe clustering performance during learning. We present extensive experiments on\nAUTOSHAPE. To evaluate the clustering performance on univariate time series\n(UTS), we compare AUTOSHAPE with 15 representative methods using UCR archive\ndatasets. To study the performance of multivariate time series (MTS), we\nevaluate AUTOSHAPE on 30 UEA archive datasets with 5 competitive methods. The\nresults validate that AUTOSHAPE is the best among all the methods compared. We\ninterpret clusters with shapelets, and can obtain interesting intuitions about\nclusters in three UTS case studies and one MTS case study, respectively.",

    "title": "Patient-Specific Game-Based Transfer Method for Parkinson's Disease  Severity Prediction",
    "abstract": "Dysphonia is one of the early symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Most\nexisting methods use feature selection methods to find the optimal subset of\nvoice features for all PD patients to improve the prediction performance. Few\nhave considered the heterogeneity between patients, which implies the need to\nprovide specific prediction models for different patients. However, building\nthis prediction model for each patient faces the challenge of small sample\nsize, which makes it lack generalization ability. Instance transfer is an\neffective way to make up for this deficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes a\npatient-specific game-based transfer (PSGT) method for PD severity prediction.\nFirst, a selection mechanism is used to select PD patients with similar disease\ntrends to the target patient from the source domain, which greatly reduces the\nscope of instance transfer and reduces the risk of negative transfer. Then, the\ncontribution of the transferred subjects and their instances to the disease\nestimation of the target subject is fairly evaluated by the Shapley value,\nwhich improves the interpretability of the method. Next, the proportion of\nvalid instances is determined according to the contribution of transferred\nsubjects, and the instances with higher contribution are transferred based on\nthis proportion to further reduce the difference between the transferred\ninstance subset and the target subject. Finally, the selected subset of\ninstances is added to the training set of the target subject, and the extended\ndata is fed into the random forest to improve the performance of the PD\nseverity prediction method. Parkinson's telemonitoring dataset is used to\nevaluate the feasibility and effectiveness. Experiment results show that the\nproposed PSGT method has better performance in both prediction error and\nstability over compared methods.",

From an optimization point of\nview, the NAS tasks involving multiple design criteria are intrinsically\nmultiobjective optimization problems; hence, it is reasonable to adopt\nevolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms for tackling them.\nNonetheless, there is still a clear gap confining the related research along\nthis pathway: on the one hand, there is a lack of a general problem formulation\nof NAS tasks from an optimization point of view; on the other hand, there are\nchallenges in conducting benchmark assessments of EMO algorithms on NAS tasks.\nTo bridge the gap: (i) we formulate NAS tasks into general multi-objective\noptimization problems and analyze the complex characteristics from an\noptimization point of view; (ii) we present an end-to-end pipeline, dubbed\n$\\texttt{EvoXBench}$, to generate benchmark test problems for EMO algorithms to\nrun efficiently -- without the requirement of GPUs or Pytorch/Tensorflow; (iii)\nwe instantiate two test suites comprehensively covering two datasets, seven\nsearch spaces, and three hardware devices, involving up to eight objectives.\nBased on the above, we validate the proposed test suites using six\nrepresentative EMO algorithms and provide some empirical analyses.

A primer on\nautomatically learning to predict performance regressions in software, this\narticle gives an account of the experiences we gained when researching and\ndeploying an ML-based regression prediction pipeline at Meta. In this paper, we\nreport on a comparative study with four ML models of increasing complexity,\nfrom (1) code-opaque, over (2) Bag of Words, (3) off-the-shelve\nTransformer-based, to (4) a bespoke Transformer-based model, coined\nSuperPerforator.

Our results also call into question the general\napplicability of Transformer-based architectures for performance prediction: an\noff-the-shelve CodeBERT-based approach had surprisingly poor performance; our\nhighly customized SuperPerforator architecture initially achieved prediction\nperformance that was just on par with simpler Bag of Words models, and only\noutperformed them for down-stream use cases. This ability of SuperPerforator to\ntransfer to an application with few learning examples afforded an opportunity\nto deploy it in practice at Meta: it can act as a pre-filter to sort out\nchanges that are unlikely to introduce a regression, truncating the space of\nchanges to search a regression in by up to 43%, a 45x improvement over a random\nbaseline.

    "abstract": "Nondestructive testing (NDT) is widely applied to defect identification of\nturbine components during manufacturing and operation. Operational efficiency\nis key for gas turbine OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturers). Automating the\ninspection process as much as possible, while minimizing the uncertainties\ninvolved, is thus crucial. We propose a model based on RetinaNet to identify\ndrilling defects in X-ray images of turbine blades. The application is\nchallenging due to the large image resolutions in which defects are very small\nand hardly captured by the commonly used anchor sizes, and also due to the\nsmall size of the available dataset. As a matter of fact, all these issues are\npretty common in the application of Deep Learning-based object detection models\nto industrial defect data. We overcome such issues using open source models,\nsplitting the input images into tiles and scaling them up, applying heavy data\naugmentation, and optimizing the anchor size and aspect ratios with a\ndifferential evolution solver. We validate the model with $3$-fold\ncross-validation, showing a very high accuracy in identifying images with\ndefects. We also define a set of best practices which can help other\npractitioners overcome similar challenges.",

The difficulties come from two aspects:\nthe existing geometry processing or forward simulation methods penalize the\ndifference between the current status and the rest configuration to maintain\nthe initial shape, which will lead to sharp spikes or wiggles for large\ndeformations; the co-dimensional nature of the problem makes it more\ncomplicated because the deformed surface has to locally satisfy compatibility\nconditions on fundamental forms to guarantee a feasible solution exists. To\naddress these two challenges, we propose a rotation-strain method to modify the\nfundamental forms in a compatible way, and model the large deformation of\nsurface meshes smoothly using plasticity. The user prescribes the positions of\na few vertices, and our method finds a smooth strain and rotation field under\nwhich the surface meets the target positions. We demonstrate several examples\nwhereby triangle meshes are smoothly deformed to large strains while meeting\nuser constraints.",

    "abstract": "The automated machine learning (AutoML) process can require searching through\ncomplex configuration spaces of not only machine learning (ML) components and\ntheir hyperparameters but also ways of composing them together, i.e. forming ML\npipelines. Optimisation efficiency and the model accuracy attainable for a\nfixed time budget suffer if this pipeline configuration space is excessively\nlarge. A key research question is whether it is both possible and practical to\npreemptively avoid costly evaluations of poorly performing ML pipelines by\nleveraging their historical performance for various ML tasks, i.e.\nmeta-knowledge. The previous experience comes in the form of\nclassifier/regressor accuracy rankings derived from either (1) a substantial\nbut non-exhaustive number of pipeline evaluations made during historical AutoML\nruns, i.e. 'opportunistic' meta-knowledge, or (2) comprehensive cross-validated\nevaluations of classifiers/regressors with default hyperparameters, i.e.\n'systematic' meta-knowledge. Numerous experiments with the AutoWeka4MCPS\npackage suggest that (1) opportunistic/systematic meta-knowledge can improve ML\noutcomes, typically in line with how relevant that meta-knowledge is, and (2)\nconfiguration-space culling is optimal when it is neither too conservative nor\ntoo radical. However, the utility and impact of meta-knowledge depend\ncritically on numerous facets of its generation and exploitation, warranting\nextensive analysis; these are often overlooked/underappreciated within AutoML\nand meta-learning literature. In particular, we observe strong sensitivity to\nthe `challenge' of a dataset, i.e. whether specificity in choosing a predictor\nleads to significantly better performance. Ultimately, identifying `difficult'\ndatasets, thus defined, is crucial to both generating informative\nmeta-knowledge bases and understanding optimal search-space reduction\nstrategies.",

In this paper, we present a framework to\ntrack the RIS reflection coefficients with the aid of deep learning from a\ntime-series prediction perspective in a terahertz (THz) communication system.\nThe proposed framework achieves a two-step enhancement over the similar\nlearning-driven counterparts. Specifically, in the first step, we train a\nliquid state machine (LSM) to track the historical RIS reflection coefficients\nat prior time steps (known as a time-series sequence) and predict their\nupcoming time steps. We also fine-tune the trained LSM through Xavier\ninitialization technique to decrease the prediction variance, thus resulting in\na higher prediction accuracy. In the second step, we use ensemble learning\ntechnique which leverages on the prediction power of multiple LSMs to minimize\nthe prediction variance and improve the precision of the first step. It is\nnumerically demonstrated that, in the first step, employing the Xavier\ninitialization technique to fine-tune the LSM results in at most 26% lower LSM\nprediction variance and as much as 46% achievable spectral efficiency (SE)\nimprovement over the existing counterparts, when an RIS of size 11x11 is\ndeployed. In the second step, under the same computational complexity of\ntraining a single LSM, the ensemble learning with multiple LSMs degrades the\nprediction variance of a single LSM up to 66% and improves the system\nachievable SE at most 54%.",

    "abstract": "Due to their pedagogical advantages, large final projects in information\nvisualization courses have become standard practice. Students take on a\nclient--real or simulated--a dataset, and a vague set of goals to create a\ncomplete visualization or visual analytics product. Unfortunately, many\nprojects suffer from ambiguous goals, over or under-constrained client\nexpectations, and data constraints that have students spending their time on\nnon-visualization problems (e.g., data cleaning). These are important skills,\nbut are often secondary course objectives, and unforeseen problems can majorly\nhinder students. We created an alternative for our information visualization\ncourse: Roboviz, a real-time game for students to play by building a\nvisualization-focused interface. By designing the game mechanics around four\ndifferent data types, the project allows students to create a wide array of\ninteractive visualizations. Student teams play against their classmates with\nthe objective to collect the most (good) robots. The flexibility of the\nstrategies encourages variability, a range of approaches, and solving wicked\ndesign constraints. We describe the construction of this game and report on\nstudent projects over two years. We further show how the game mechanics can be\nextended or adapted to other game-based projects.",

    "abstract": "Parameter tuning for robotic systems is a time-consuming and challenging task\nthat often relies on domain expertise of the human operator. Moreover, existing\nlearning methods are not well suited for parameter tuning for many reasons\nincluding: the absence of a clear numerical metric for `good robotic behavior';\nlimited data due to the reliance on real-world experimental data; and the large\nsearch space of parameter combinations. In this work, we present an open-source\nMATLAB Preference Optimization and Learning Algorithms for Robotics toolbox\n(POLAR) for systematically exploring high-dimensional parameter spaces using\nhuman-in-the-loop preference-based learning. This aim of this toolbox is to\nsystematically and efficiently accomplish one of two objectives: 1) to optimize\nrobotic behaviors for human operator preference; 2) to learn the operator's\nunderlying preference landscape to better understand the relationship between\nadjustable parameters and operator preference. The POLAR toolbox achieves these\nobjectives using only subjective feedback mechanisms (pairwise preferences,\ncoactive feedback, and ordinal labels) to infer a Bayesian posterior over the\nunderlying reward function dictating the user's preferences. We demonstrate the\nperformance of the toolbox in simulation and present various applications of\nhuman-in-the-loop preference-based learning.",

We model these time series data as\ncomponents of the state of linear stochastic networked dynamical systems. We\nassume partial observability, where the state evolution of only a subset of\nnodes comprising the network is observed. We devise a new feature vector\ncomputed from the observed time series and prove that these features are\nlinearly separable, i.e., there exists a hyperplane that separates the cluster\nof features associated with connected pairs of nodes from those associated with\ndisconnected pairs. This renders the features amenable to train a variety of\nclassifiers to perform causal inference. In particular, we use these features\nto train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The resulting causal inference\nmechanism outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts w.r.t. sample-complexity.\nThe trained CNNs generalize well over structurally distinct networks (dense or\nsparse) and noise-level profiles. Remarkably, they also generalize well to\nreal-world networks while trained over a synthetic network (realization of a\nrandom graph). Finally, the proposed method consistently reconstructs the graph\nin a pairwise manner, that is, by deciding if an edge or arrow is present or\nabsent in each pair of nodes, from the corresponding time series of each pair.\nThis fits the framework of large-scale systems, where observation or processing\nof all nodes in the network is prohibitive.",

Besides a considerable amount of literature about modeling and\napplication of such technique in specific areas, an algorithmic approach to the\nrelated parameter identification problem is still lacking. We believe that a\nrobust algorithmic approach will allow a unified treatment of different samples\nin several application areas. In this paper, we model the parameters\nidentification problem as a constrained $L_1$-regularized non-linear least\nsquares problem. Following the approach proposed in [Analytical Chemistry 2021\n93 (24)], the non-linear least squares term imposes data consistency by\ndecomposing the acquired relaxation profiles into relaxation contributions\nassociated with 1H-1H and 1H-14N dipole-dipole interactions.

    "abstract": "Segmenting highly-overlapping image objects is challenging, because there is\ntypically no distinction between real object contours and occlusion boundaries\non images. Unlike previous instance segmentation methods, we model image\nformation as a composition of two overlapping layers, and propose Bilayer\nConvolutional Network (BCNet), where the top layer detects occluding objects\n(occluders) and the bottom layer infers partially occluded instances\n(occludees). The explicit modeling of occlusion relationship with bilayer\nstructure naturally decouples the boundaries of both the occluding and occluded\ninstances, and considers the interaction between them during mask regression.\nWe investigate the efficacy of bilayer structure using two popular\nconvolutional network designs, namely, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and\nGraph Convolutional Network (GCN). Further, we formulate bilayer decoupling\nusing the vision transformer (ViT), by representing instances in the image as\nseparate learnable occluder and occludee queries. Large and consistent\nimprovements using one/two-stage and query-based object detectors with various\nbackbones and network layer choices validate the generalization ability of\nbilayer decoupling, as shown by extensive experiments on image instance\nsegmentation benchmarks (COCO, KINS, COCOA) and video instance segmentation\nbenchmarks (YTVIS, OVIS, BDD100K MOTS), especially for heavy occlusion cases.\nCode and data are available at https://github.com/lkeab/BCNet.",

    "title": "Dispersion vs Disparity: Hiding Variability Can Encourage Stereotyping  When Visualizing Social Outcomes",
    "abstract": "Visualization research often focuses on perceptual accuracy or helping\nreaders interpret key messages. However, we know very little about how chart\ndesigns might influence readers' perceptions of the people behind the data.\nSpecifically, could designs interact with readers' social cognitive biases in\nways that perpetuate harmful stereotypes? For example, when analyzing social\ninequality, bar charts are a popular choice to present outcome disparities\nbetween race, gender, or other groups. But bar charts may encourage deficit\nthinking, the perception that outcome disparities are caused by groups'\npersonal strengths or deficiencies, rather than external factors. These faulty\npersonal attributions can then reinforce stereotypes about the groups being\nvisualized. We conducted four experiments examining design choices that\ninfluence attribution biases (and therefore deficit thinking). Crowdworkers\nviewed visualizations depicting social outcomes that either mask variability in\ndata, such as bar charts or dot plots, or emphasize variability in data, such\nas jitter plots or prediction intervals. They reported their agreement with\nboth personal and external explanations for the visualized disparities.\nOverall, when participants saw visualizations that hide within-group\nvariability, they agreed more with personal explanations. When they saw\nvisualizations that emphasize within-group variability, they agreed less with\npersonal explanations. These results demonstrate that data visualizations about\nsocial inequity can be misinterpreted in harmful ways and lead to stereotyping.\nDesign choices can influence these biases: Hiding variability tends to increase\nstereotyping while emphasizing variability reduces it.",

    "abstract": "The synthesis of high-resolution remote sensing images based on text\ndescriptions has great potential in many practical application scenarios.\nAlthough deep neural networks have achieved great success in many important\nremote sensing tasks, generating realistic remote sensing images from text\ndescriptions is still very difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel text-to-image modern Hopfield network (Txt2Img-MHN). The main idea of\nTxt2Img-MHN is to conduct hierarchical prototype learning on both text and\nimage embeddings with modern Hopfield layers. Instead of directly learning\nconcrete but highly diverse text-image joint feature representations for\ndifferent semantics, Txt2Img-MHN aims to learn the most representative\nprototypes from text-image embeddings, achieving a coarse-to-fine learning\nstrategy. These learned prototypes can then be utilized to represent more\ncomplex semantics in the text-to-image generation task. To better evaluate the\nrealism and semantic consistency of the generated images, we further conduct\nzero-shot classification on real remote sensing data using the classification\nmodel trained on synthesized images. Despite its simplicity, we find that the\noverall accuracy in the zero-shot classification may serve as a good metric to\nevaluate the ability to generate an image from text. Extensive experiments on\nthe benchmark remote sensing text-image dataset demonstrate that the proposed\nTxt2Img-MHN can generate more realistic remote sensing images than existing\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Deep and wide neural networks successfully fit very complex functions today,\nbut dense models are starting to be prohibitively expensive for inference. To\nmitigate this, one promising direction is networks that activate a sparse\nsubgraph of the network. The subgraph is chosen by a data-dependent routing\nfunction, enforcing a fixed mapping of inputs to subnetworks (e.g., the Mixture\nof Experts (MoE) paradigm in Switch Transformers). However, prior work is\nlargely empirical, and while existing routing functions work well in practice,\nthey do not lead to theoretical guarantees on approximation ability. We aim to\nprovide a theoretical explanation for the power of sparse networks. As our\nfirst contribution, we present a formal model of data-dependent sparse networks\nthat captures salient aspects of popular architectures. We then introduce a\nrouting function based on locality sensitive hashing (LSH) that enables us to\nreason about how well sparse networks approximate target functions. After\nrepresenting LSH-based sparse networks with our model, we prove that sparse\nnetworks can match the approximation power of dense networks on Lipschitz\nfunctions. Applying LSH on the input vectors means that the experts interpolate\nthe target function in different subregions of the input space. To support our\ntheory, we define various datasets based on Lipschitz target functions, and we\nshow that sparse networks give a favorable trade-off between number of active\nunits and approximation quality.",

Denoising sound has many\napplications in speech processing, sound events classification, and machine\nfailure detection systems. This paper describes a method for creating an\nautoencoder to map noisy machine sounds to clean sounds for denoising purposes.\nThere are several types of noise in sounds, for example, environmental noise\nand generated frequency-dependent noise from signal processing methods. Noise\ngenerated by environmental activities is environmental noise. In the factory,\nenvironmental noise can be created by vehicles, drilling, people working or\ntalking in the survey area, wind, and flowing water. Those noises appear as\nspikes in the sound record. In the scope of this paper, we demonstrate the\nremoval of generated noise with Gaussian distribution and the environmental\nnoise with a specific example of the water sink faucet noise from the induction\nmotor sounds. The proposed method was trained and verified on 49 normal\nfunction sounds and 197 horizontal misalignment fault sounds from the Machinery\nFault Database (MAFAULDA). The mean square error (MSE) was used as the\nassessment criteria to evaluate the similarity between denoised sounds using\nthe proposed autoencoder and the original sounds in the test set.

We show that the standard\nstate-space model based on least squares or subspace estimators fails to exist\nfor these models. We overcome this challenge by considering a least-squares\nestimator directly on the coupled swing-equation model but not on its\ntransformed first-order state-space form. We specifically focus on estimating\ninertia (mechanical and virtual) and damping constants, although our method is\ngeneral enough for estimating other parameters. Our theoretical analysis\nhighlights the role of network topology on the parameter estimates of an\nindividual generator. For generators with greater connectivity, estimation of\nthe associated parameters is more susceptible to variations in other generator\nstates.

Implementation of transit priority\nwith perimeter control measures, which allow transit into a controlled area\nwithout queuing at the perimeter boundary, is an effective strategy in bimodal\ntransportation systems. However, travelers' behavior changes in response to\nperimeter control strategies, such as shifts in their departure times and\ntransportation modes, have not been fully investigated. Therefore, important\nquestions remain, such as the use of transit during perimeter control with\ntransit priority. This paper examines the travelers' behavior changes in\nresponse to perimeter control with transit priority in a mixed bimodal\ntransportation system with cars and flexible route transit (FRT) vehicles. We\nmodel departure time and transportation mode choices in such a transportation\nsystem with hypercongestion and discomfort in FRT (called the mixed bimodal\nbathtub model). Initially, we investigate the properties of dynamic user\nequilibrium without perimeter control. Then, we study the equilibrium patterns\nduring perimeter control with transit priority. Unlike existing work, we find\nthat the number of FRT passengers decreases with time toward the desired\narrival time and that FRT may not be used around the peak of rush hour.\nFuthermore, transit priority may not be sufficient to promote the use of FRT,\nand additional incentive such as subsidy for lower fares may be required to\nencourage FRT use during perimeter control.

Finally, pruning embedding parameters will lead to a sparse\nembedding table, which is hard to be deployed. To this end, we propose an\noptimal embedding table learning framework OptEmbed, which provides a practical\nand general method to find an optimal embedding table for various base CTR\nmodels. Specifically, we propose pruning the redundant embeddings regarding\ncorresponding features' importance by learnable pruning thresholds.\nFurthermore, we consider assigning various embedding dimensions as one single\ncandidate architecture. To efficiently search the optimal embedding dimensions,\nwe design a uniform embedding dimension sampling scheme to equally train all\ncandidate architectures, meaning architecture-related parameters and learnable\nthresholds are trained simultaneously in one supernet. We then propose an\nevolution search method based on the supernet to find the optimal embedding\ndimensions for each field. Experiments on public datasets show that OptEmbed\ncan learn a compact embedding table which can further improve the model\nperformance.",

    "title": "Good locally repairable codes via propagation rules",
    "abstract": "In classical coding theory, it is common to construct new codes via\npropagation rules. There are various propagation rules to construct classical\nblock codes. However, propagation rules have not been extensively explored for\nconstructions of locally repairable codes. In this paper, we introduce a few\npropagation rules to construct good locally repairable codes. To our surprise,\nthese simple propagation rules produce a few interesting results. Firstly, by\nconcatenating a locally repairable code as an inner code with a classical block\ncode as an outer code, we obtain quite a few dimension-optimal binary locally\nrepairable codes. Secondly, from this concatenation, we explicitly build a\nfamily of locally repairable codes that exceeds the Zyablov-type bound.\nThirdly, by a lengthening propagation rule that adds some rows and columns from\na parity-check matrix of a given linear code, we are able to produce a family\nof dimension-optimal binary locally repairable codes from the extended Hamming\ncodes, and to convert a classical maximum distance separable (MDS) code into a\nSingleton-optimal locally repairable code. Furthermore, via the lengthening\npropagation rule, we greatly simplify the construction of a family of locally\nrepairable codes in \\cite[Theorem 5]{MX20} that breaks the asymptotic\nGilbert-Varshamov bound. In addition, we make use of three other propagation\nrules to produce more dimension-optimal binary locally repairable codes.\nFinally, one of phenomena that we observe in this paper is that some trivial\npropagation rules in classical block codes do not hold anymore for locally\nrepairable codes.",

When\nthe user makes contact with the desired object, the re-grasping reflex aligns\nthe gripper fingers with antipodal points on the object to maximize the grasp\nstability. The reflex takes only 150ms to correct for inaccurate grasps chosen\nby the user, so the user's motion is only minimally disturbed by the execution\nof the re-grasp. Once antipodal contact is established, the anti-slip reflex\nensures that the gripper applies enough normal force to prevent the object from\nslipping out of the grasp. The combination of proprioceptive manipulators and\nreflexive grasping allows the user to complete teleoperated tasks with\nprecision at high speed.",

    "title": "Speaker-adaptive Lip Reading with User-dependent Padding",
    "abstract": "Lip reading aims to predict speech based on lip movements alone. As it\nfocuses on visual information to model the speech, its performance is\ninherently sensitive to personal lip appearances and movements. This makes the\nlip reading models show degraded performance when they are applied to unseen\nspeakers due to the mismatch between training and testing conditions. Speaker\nadaptation technique aims to reduce this mismatch between train and test\nspeakers, thus guiding a trained model to focus on modeling the speech content\nwithout being intervened by the speaker variations. In contrast to the efforts\nmade in audio-based speech recognition for decades, the speaker adaptation\nmethods have not well been studied in lip reading. In this paper, to remedy the\nperformance degradation of lip reading model on unseen speakers, we propose a\nspeaker-adaptive lip reading method, namely user-dependent padding. The\nuser-dependent padding is a speaker-specific input that can participate in the\nvisual feature extraction stage of a pre-trained lip reading model. Therefore,\nthe lip appearances and movements information of different speakers can be\nconsidered during the visual feature encoding, adaptively for individual\nspeakers. Moreover, the proposed method does not need 1) any additional layers,\n2) to modify the learned weights of the pre-trained model, and 3) the speaker\nlabel of train data used during pre-train. It can directly adapt to unseen\nspeakers by learning the user-dependent padding only, in a supervised or\nunsupervised manner. Finally, to alleviate the speaker information\ninsufficiency in public lip reading databases, we label the speaker of a\nwell-known audio-visual database, LRW, and design an unseen-speaker lip reading\nscenario named LRW-ID.",

Then, based on the assignment matrix, we can\nalign the feature distributions between the two domains with the graph-based\nlocal feature loss.

    "abstract": "Image aesthetic quality assessment is popular during the last decade. Besides\nnumerical assessment, nature language assessment (aesthetic captioning) has\nbeen proposed to describe the generally aesthetic impression of an image. In\nthis paper, we propose aesthetic attribute assessment, which is the aesthetic\nattributes captioning, i.e., to assess the aesthetic attributes such as\ncomposition, lighting usage and color arrangement. It is a non-trivial task to\nlabel the comments of aesthetic attributes, which limit the scale of the\ncorresponding datasets. We construct a novel dataset, named DPC-CaptionsV2, by\na semi-automatic way. The knowledge is transferred from a small-scale dataset\nwith full annotations to large-scale professional comments from a photography\nwebsite. Images of DPC-CaptionsV2 contain comments up to 4 aesthetic\nattributes: composition, lighting, color, and subject. Then, we propose a new\nversion of Aesthetic Multi-Attributes Networks (AMANv2) based on the BUTD model\nand the VLPSA model. AMANv2 fuses features of a mixture of small-scale PCCD\ndataset with full annotations and large-scale DPCCaptionsV2 dataset with full\nannotations. The experimental results of DPCCaptionsV2 show that our method can\npredict the comments on 4 aesthetic attributes, which are closer to aesthetic\ntopics than those produced by the previous AMAN model. Through the evaluation\ncriteria of image captioning, the specially designed AMANv2 model is better to\nthe CNN-LSTM model and the AMAN model.",

    "abstract": "This work considers the task of representation learning on the attributed\nrelational graph (ARG). Both the nodes and edges in an ARG are associated with\nattributes/features allowing ARGs to encode rich structural information widely\nobserved in real applications. Existing graph neural networks offer limited\nability to capture complex interactions within local structural contexts, which\nhinders them from taking advantage of the expression power of ARGs. We propose\nMotif Convolution Module (MCM), a new motif-based graph representation learning\ntechnique to better utilize local structural information. The ability to handle\ncontinuous edge and node features is one of MCM's advantages over existing\nmotif-based models. MCM builds a motif vocabulary in an unsupervised way and\ndeploys a novel motif convolution operation to extract the local structural\ncontext of individual nodes, which is then used to learn higher-level node\nrepresentations via multilayer perceptron and/or message passing in graph\nneural networks. When compared with other graph learning approaches to\nclassifying synthetic graphs, our approach is substantially better in capturing\nstructural context. We also demonstrate the performance and explainability\nadvantages of our approach by applying it to several molecular benchmarks.",

While existing models have demonstrated great success in predicting\nmarginal agent future behaviors, it remains a challenge to efficiently predict\nconsistent joint behaviors of multiple agents.

In this work, we propose a novel\noccupancy flow fields predictor to produce accurate occupancy and flow\npredictions, by combining the power of an image encoder that learns features\nfrom a rasterized traffic image and a vector encoder that captures information\nof continuous agent trajectories and map states.

    "abstract": "DBSCAN is widely used in many scientific and engineering fields because of\nits simplicity and practicality. However, due to its high sensitivity\nparameters, the accuracy of the clustering result depends heavily on practical\nexperience. In this paper, we first propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning\nguided automatic DBSCAN parameters search framework, namely DRL-DBSCAN. The\nframework models the process of adjusting the parameter search direction by\nperceiving the clustering environment as a Markov decision process, which aims\nto find the best clustering parameters without manual assistance. DRL-DBSCAN\nlearns the optimal clustering parameter search policy for different feature\ndistributions via interacting with the clusters, using a weakly-supervised\nreward training policy network. In addition, we also present a recursive search\nmechanism driven by the scale of the data to efficiently and controllably\nprocess large parameter spaces. Extensive experiments are conducted on five\nartificial and real-world datasets based on the proposed four working modes.\nThe results of offline and online tasks show that the DRL-DBSCAN not only\nconsistently improves DBSCAN clustering accuracy by up to 26% and 25%\nrespectively, but also can stably find the dominant parameters with high\ncomputational efficiency.

Its\npromising potential also comes with major challenges, in particular the reduced\ncoverage due to harsh propagation loss, hardware constraints, and blockage\nvulnerability. To increase the coverage of THz communication, we revisit\ncooperative communication. We propose a new type of cooperative rate-splitting\n(CRS) called extraction-based CRS (eCRS). Furthermore, we explore two extreme\ncases of eCRS, namely, identical eCRS and distinct eCRS. To enable the proposed\neCRS framework, we design a novel THz cooperative channel model by considering\nunique characteristics of THz communication. Through mathematical derivations\nand convex optimization techniques considering the THz cooperative channel\nmodel, we derive local optimal solutions for the two cases of eCRS and a global\noptimal closed form solution for a specific scenario. Finally, we propose a\nnovel channel estimation technique that not only specifies the channel value,\nbut also the time delay of the channel from each cooperating user equipment to\nfully utilize the THz cooperative channel. In simulation results, we verify the\nvalidity of the two cases of our proposed framework and channel estimation\ntechnique.",

The engagement of students in virtual learning\ncan have a major impact on meeting learning objectives and program dropout\nrisks. There exist many measurement instruments specifically geared to Student\nEngagement (SE) in virtual learning environments. In this critical review, we\nanalyze these works and highlight inconsistencies in terms of differing\nengagement definitions and measurement scales. This diversity among existing\nresearchers could potentially be problematic in comparing different annotations\nand building generalizable predictive models. We further discuss issues in\nterms of engagement annotations and design flaws. We analyze the existing SE\nannotation scales based on our defined seven dimensions of engagement\nannotation, including sources, data modalities used for annotation, the time\nwhen the annotation takes place, the timesteps in which the annotation takes\nplace, level of abstraction, combination, and quantification. One of the\nsurprising findings was that very few of the reviewed datasets on SE\nmeasurement used existing psychometrically validated engagement scales in their\nannotation. Lastly, we discuss some other scales in settings other than virtual\nlearning that have the potential to be used in measuring SE in virtual\nlearning.",

There has not been much research on the fusion model\nwhile it has great impact on the final recommendation as the last crucial\nprocess of the ranking. To optimize long-term user satisfaction rather than\nobtain instant returns greedily, we formulate MTF task as Markov Decision\nProcess (MDP) within a recommendation session and propose a Batch Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) based Multi-Task Fusion framework (BatchRL-MTF) that includes a\nBatch RL framework and an online exploration. The former exploits Batch RL to\nlearn an optimal recommendation policy from the fixed batch data offline for\nlong-term user satisfaction, while the latter explores potential high-value\nactions online to break through the local optimal dilemma. With a comprehensive\ninvestigation on user behaviors, we model the user satisfaction reward with\nsubtle heuristics from two aspects of user stickiness and user activeness.\nFinally, we conduct extensive experiments on a billion-sample level real-world\ndataset to show the effectiveness of our model.

These shifts have affected two key stakeholders: transit operators\nand first- and last-mile (FLM) services. Although most cities continue to\ninvest heavily in bus and metro projects to make public transit attractive,\nridership in these systems has often failed to reach targeted levels. FLM\nservice providers also experience lower demand and revenues in the wake of\nshifts to other means of transport. Effective FLM options are required to\nprevent this phenomenon and make public transport attractive for commuters. One\npossible solution is to forge partnerships between public transport and FLM\nproviders that offer competitive joint mobility options. Such solutions require\nprudent allocation of supply and optimised strategies for FLM operations and\nride-sharing. To this end, we build an agent- and event-based simulation model\nwhich captures interactions between passengers and FLM services using\nstatecharts, vehicle routing models, and other trip matching rules.

However, most studies tend to focus more\non the models than the quality of the datasets when assessing the models'\nperformance in tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). While this works\nwell in most cases, it does not account for the limitations of doing NLP with\nlow-resource languages, that is, the quality and the quantity of the dataset at\nour disposal. This paper provides an analysis of the performance of various\nmodels based on the quality of the dataset.

    "abstract": "Graph similarity measurement, which computes the distance/similarity between\ntwo graphs, arises in various graph-related tasks. Recent learning-based\nmethods lack interpretability, as they directly transform interaction\ninformation between two graphs into one hidden vector and then map it to\nsimilarity. To cope with this problem, this study proposes a more interpretable\nend-to-end paradigm for graph similarity learning, named Similarity Computation\nvia Maximum Common Subgraph Inference (INFMCS). Our critical insight into\nINFMCS is the strong correlation between similarity score and Maximum Common\nSubgraph (MCS). We implicitly infer MCS to obtain the normalized MCS size, with\nthe supervision information being only the similarity score during training. To\ncapture more global information, we also stack some vanilla transformer encoder\nlayers with graph convolution layers and propose a novel permutation-invariant\nnode Positional Encoding. The entire model is quite simple yet effective.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that INFMCS consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines for graph-graph classification and regression tasks.\nAblation experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed computation\nparadigm and other components. Also, visualization and statistics of results\nreveal the interpretability of INFMCS.",

Therefore, we propose a sensitiveness\nbased method to evaluate the importance of each layer from the perspective of\ninference accuracy by adding extra damage for the original model. Because the\nperformance of the accuracy is determined by the distribution of parameters\nacross all layers rather than individual parameter, the sensitiveness based\nmethod will be robust to update of parameters. Namely, we can obtain similar\nimportance evaluation of each convolutional layer between the imperfect-trained\nand fully trained models. For VGG-16 on CIFAR-10, even when the original model\nis only trained with 50 epochs, we can get same evaluation of layer importance\nas the results when the model is trained fully. Then we will remove filters\nproportional from each layer by the quantified sensitiveness.

However, such methods cannot be well applied to real-world\nscenarios, in which the partially observed surrogates are mixed with their\nproxies among short-term outcomes. To this end, we develop our flexible method,\nLaser, to estimate long-term causal effects in the more realistic situation\nthat the surrogates are observed or have observed proxies.Given the\nindistinguishability between the surrogates and proxies, we utilize\nidentifiable variational auto-encoder (iVAE) to recover the whole valid\nsurrogates on all the surrogates candidates without the need of distinguishing\nthe observed surrogates or the proxies of latent surrogates.

    "abstract": "Human motion synthesis and editing are essential to many applications like\nfilm post-production. However, they often introduce artefacts in motions, which\ncan be detrimental to the perceived realism. In particular, footskating is a\nfrequent and disturbing artefact requiring foot contacts knowledge to be\ncleaned up. Current approaches to obtain foot contact labels rely either on\nunreliable threshold-based heuristics or on tedious manual annotation. In this\narticle, we address foot contact label detection from motion with a deep\nlearning. To this end, we first publicly release UnderPressure, a novel motion\ncapture database labelled with pressure insoles data serving as reliable\nknowledge of foot contact with the ground. Then, we design and train a deep\nneural network to estimate ground reaction forces exerted on the feet from\nmotion data and then derive accurate foot contact labels. The evaluation of our\nmodel shows that we significantly outperform heuristic approaches based on\nheight and velocity thresholds and that our approach is much more robust on\nmotion sequences suffering from perturbations like noise or footskate. We\nfurther propose a fully automatic workflow for footskate cleanup: foot contact\nlabels are first derived from estimated ground reaction forces. Then, footskate\nis removed by solving foot constraints through an optimisation-based inverse\nkinematics (IK) approach that ensures consistency with the estimated ground\nreaction forces. Beyond footskate cleanup, both the database and the method we\npropose could help to improve many approaches based on foot contact labels or\nground reaction forces, including inverse dynamics problems like motion\nreconstruction and learning of deep motion models in motion synthesis or\ncharacter animation.

    "abstract": "Recent sequential recommendation models rely increasingly on consecutive\nshort-term user-item interaction sequences to model user interests. These\napproaches have, however, raised concerns about both short- and long-term\ninterests. (1) {\\it short-term}: interaction sequences may not result from a\nmonolithic interest, but rather from several intertwined interests, even within\na short period of time, resulting in their failures to model skip behaviors;\n(2) {\\it long-term}: interaction sequences are primarily observed sparsely at\ndiscrete intervals, other than consecutively over the long run. This renders\ndifficulty in inferring long-term interests, since only discrete interest\nrepresentations can be derived, without taking into account interest dynamics\nacross sequences. In this study, we address these concerns by learning (1)\nmulti-scale representations of short-term interests; and (2) dynamics-aware\nrepresentations of long-term interests. To this end, we present an\n\\textbf{I}nterest \\textbf{D}ynamics modeling framework using generative\n\\textbf{N}eural \\textbf{P}rocesses, coined IDNP, to model user interests from a\nfunctional perspective. IDNP learns a global interest function family to define\neach user's long-term interest as a function instantiation, manifesting\ninterest dynamics through function continuity. Specifically, IDNP first encodes\neach user's short-term interactions into multi-scale representations, which are\nthen summarized as user context. By combining latent global interest with user\ncontext, IDNP then reconstructs long-term user interest functions and predicts\ninteractions at upcoming query timestep. Moreover, IDNP can model such interest\nfunctions even when interaction sequences are limited and non-consecutive.\nExtensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our model\noutperforms state-of-the-arts on various evaluation metrics.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose Reciprocal Distribution Alignment (RDA) to address\nsemi-supervised learning (SSL), which is a hyperparameter-free framework that\nis independent of confidence threshold and works with both the matched\n(conventionally) and the mismatched class distributions. Distribution mismatch\nis an often overlooked but more general SSL scenario where the labeled and the\nunlabeled data do not fall into the identical class distribution. This may lead\nto the model not exploiting the labeled data reliably and drastically degrade\nthe performance of SSL methods, which could not be rescued by the traditional\ndistribution alignment. In RDA, we enforce a reciprocal alignment on the\ndistributions of the predictions from two classifiers predicting pseudo-labels\nand complementary labels on the unlabeled data. These two distributions,\ncarrying complementary information, could be utilized to regularize each other\nwithout any prior of class distribution. Moreover, we theoretically show that\nRDA maximizes the input-output mutual information. Our approach achieves\npromising performance in SSL under a variety of scenarios of mismatched\ndistributions, as well as the conventional matched SSL setting.

    "abstract": "Despite echo chambers in social media have been under considerable scrutiny,\ngeneral models for their detection and analysis are missing. In this work, we\naim to fill this gap by proposing a probabilistic generative model that\nexplains social media footprints -- i.e., social network structure and\npropagations of information -- through a set of latent communities,\ncharacterized by a degree of echo-chamber behavior and by an opinion polarity.\nSpecifically, echo chambers are modeled as communities that are permeable to\npieces of information with similar ideological polarity, and impermeable to\ninformation of opposed leaning: this allows discriminating echo chambers from\ncommunities that lack a clear ideological alignment.\nTo learn the model parameters we propose a scalable, stochastic adaptation of\nthe Generalized Expectation Maximization algorithm, that optimizes the joint\nlikelihood of observing social connections and information propagation.\nExperiments on synthetic data show that our algorithm is able to correctly\nreconstruct ground-truth latent communities with their degree of echo-chamber\nbehavior and opinion polarity. Experiments on real-world data about polarized\nsocial and political debates, such as the Brexit referendum or the COVID-19\nvaccine campaign, confirm the effectiveness of our proposal in detecting echo\nchambers. Finally, we show how our model can improve accuracy in auxiliary\npredictive tasks, such as stance detection and prediction of future\npropagations.",

The question that naturally arises in this setting\nis: Given such a probabilistic graph and a specific causal effect of interest,\nwhat is the subgraph which has the highest plausibility and for which the\ncausal effect is identifiable?

First, we reduce this problem to\nnon-determinism of concurrent systems, automatically extracting a distributed\nActive Object model from underspecified, sequential C code. This translation\nprocess provides a fully formal semantics for the considered C subset. In the\nextracted model every non-deterministic choice corresponds to one possible\nevaluation order. This step also automatically translates specifications in the\nANSI/ISO C Specification Language (ACSL) into method contracts and object\ninvariants for Active Objects. We then perform verification on the specified\nActive Objects model, using the Crowbar theorem prover, which verifies the\nextracted model with respect to the translated specification and ensures the\noriginal property of the C code for all possible evaluation orders. By using\nmodel extraction, we can use standard tools, without designing a new complex\nprogram logic to deal with underspecification. The case study used is highly\nunderspecified and cannot be handled correctly by existing tools for C.",

    "abstract": "Communication is an essential element of modern software, yet programming and\nanalysing communicating systems are difficult tasks. A reason for this\ndifficulty is the lack of compositional mechanisms that preserve relevant\ncommunication properties.\nThis problem has been recently addressed for the well-known model of\ncommunicating systems, that is sets of components consisting of finite-state\nmachines capable of exchanging messages. The main idea of this approach is to\ntake two systems, select a participant from each of them, and derive from those\nparticipants a pair of coupled gateways connecting the two systems. More\nprecisely, a message directed to one of the gateways is forwarded to the\ngateway in the other system, which sends it to the other system. It has been\nshown that, under some suitable compatibility conditions between gateways, this\ncomposition mechanism preserves deadlock freedom for asynchronous as well as\nsymmetric synchronous communications (where sender and receiver play the same\npart in determining which message to exchange).\nThis paper considers the case of asymmetric synchronous communications where\nsenders decide independently which message should be exchanged. We show here\nthat preservation of lock freedom requires sequentiality of gateways, while\nthis is not needed for preservation of either deadlock freedom or strong lock\nfreedom.",

    "abstract": "Melanoma is a serious form of skin cancer with high mortality rate at later\nstages. Fortunately, when detected early, the prognosis of melanoma is\npromising and malignant melanoma incidence rates are relatively low. As a\nresult, datasets are heavily imbalanced which complicates training current\nstate-of-the-art supervised classification AI models. We propose to use\ngenerative models to learn the benign data distribution and detect\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD) malignant images through density estimation.\nNormalizing Flows (NFs) are ideal candidates for OOD detection due to their\nability to compute exact likelihoods. Nevertheless, their inductive biases\ntowards apparent graphical features rather than semantic context hamper\naccurate OOD detection. In this work, we aim at using these biases with\ndomain-level knowledge of melanoma, to improve likelihood-based OOD detection\nof malignant images. Our encouraging results demonstrate potential for OOD\ndetection of melanoma using NFs. We achieve a 9\\% increase in Area Under Curve\nof the Receiver Operating Characteristics by using wavelet-based NFs. This\nmodel requires significantly less parameters for inference making it more\napplicable on edge devices. The proposed methodology can aid medical experts\nwith diagnosis of skin-cancer patients and continuously increase survival\nrates.

    "abstract": "Online self-disclosure is perhaps one of the last decade's most studied\ncommunication processes, thanks to the introduction of Online Social Networks\n(OSNs) like Facebook. Self-disclosure research has contributed significantly to\nthe design of preventative nudges seeking to support and guide users when\nrevealing private information in OSNs. Still, assessing the effectiveness of\nthese solutions is often challenging since changing or modifying the choice\narchitecture of OSN platforms is practically unfeasible. In turn, the\neffectiveness of numerous nudging designs is supported primarily by\nself-reported data instead of actual behavioral information. This work presents\nENAGRAM, an app for evaluating preventative nudges, and reports the first\nresults of an empirical study conducted with it. Such a study aims to showcase\nhow the app (and the data collected with it) can be leveraged to assess the\neffectiveness of a particular nudging approach. We used ENAGRAM as a vehicle to\ntest a risk-based strategy for nudging the self-disclosure decisions of\nInstagram users. For this, we created two variations of the same nudge and\ntested it in a between-subjects experimental setting. Study participants (N=22)\nwere recruited via Prolific and asked to use the app regularly for 7 days. An\nonline survey was distributed at the end of the experiment to measure some\nprivacy-related constructs. From the data collected with ENAGRAM, we observed\nlower (though non-significant) self-disclosure levels when applying risk-based\ninterventions. The constructs measured with the survey were not significant\neither, except for participants' External Information Privacy Concerns. Our\nresults suggest that (i) ENAGRAM is a suitable alternative for conducting\nlongitudinal experiments in a privacy-friendly way, and (ii) it provides a\nflexible framework for the evaluation of a broad spectrum of nudging solutions.",

    "abstract": "Gradual advancement of control technology gives rise to the studies of the\nstability of linear systems. The stability of the linear multiagent system is\nmotivated by increasing utilization of agent dynamics together with the number\nof control protocols associated with each agent. To that respect, in this\nreport, the idea of event-triggered control and the stability of the linear\nmultiagent system under steady-state performance conditions will be presented.\nBy applying a steady-state condition, the state of an agent in the closed-loop\nlinear system will be discussed using fixed network topology both in\ndiscrete-time and continuous-time. Moreover, the system is also analyzed by\nemploying the Lyapunov function methods, and then an average consensus of the\nsystem will also be realized. Finally, we will verify the system's average\nconsensus and stability via a simulation example.",

    "abstract": "Delineation of tumors and organs-at-risk permits detecting and correcting\nchanges in the patients' anatomy throughout the treatment, making it a core\nstep of adaptive proton therapy (APT). Although AI-based auto-contouring\ntechnologies have sped up this process, the time needed to perform the quality\nassessment (QA) of the generated contours remains a bottleneck, taking\nclinicians between several minutes up to an hour to complete. This paper\nintroduces a fast contouring workflow suitable for time-critical APT, enabling\ndetection of anatomical changes in shorter time frames and with a lower demand\nof clinical resources. The proposed human-centered AI-infused workflow follows\ntwo principles uncovered after reviewing the APT literature and conducting\nseveral interviews and an observational study in two radiotherapy centers in\nthe Netherlands. First, enable targeted inspection of the generated contours by\nleveraging AI uncertainty and clinically-relevant features such as the\nproximity of the organs-at-risk to the tumor. Second, minimize the number of\ninteractions needed to edit faulty delineations with redundancy-aware editing\ntools that provide the user a sense of predictability and control. We use a\nproof of concept that we validated with clinicians to demonstrate how current\nand upcoming AI capabilities support the workflow and how it would fit into\nclinical practice.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of natural language processing (NLP) technology,\nNLP models have shown great economic value in business. However, the owner's\nmodels are vulnerable to the threat of pirated redistribution, which breaks the\nsymmetry relationship between model owners and consumers. Therefore, a model\nprotection mechanism is needed to keep the symmetry from being broken.\nCurrently, language model protection schemes based on black-box verification\nperform poorly in terms of invisibility of trigger samples, which are easily\ndetected by humans or anomaly detectors and thus prevent verification. To solve\nthis problem, this paper proposes a trigger sample of the triggerless mode for\nownership verification. In addition, a thief may replace the classification\nmodule for a watermarked model to satisfy its specific classification task and\nremove the watermark present in the model. Therefore, this paper further\nproposes a new threat of replacing the model classification module and\nperforming global fine-tuning of the model, and successfully verifies the model\nownership through a white-box approach. Meanwhile, we use the properties of\nblockchain such as tamper-proof and traceability to prevent the ownership\nstatement of thieves. Experiments show that the proposed scheme successfully\nverifies ownership with 100% watermark verification accuracy without affecting\nthe original performance of the model, and has strong robustness and low False\ntrigger rate.",

    "abstract": "The finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) framework which corresponds a\nsignal/image to a structured low-rank matrix is emerging as an alternative to\nthe traditional sparse regularization. This is because such an off-the-grid\napproach is able to alleviate the basis mismatch between the true support in\nthe continuous domain and the discrete grid. In this paper, we propose a\ntwo-stage off-the-grid regularization model for the image restoration. Given\nthat the discontinuities/edges of the image lie in the zero level set of a\nband-limited periodic function, we can derive that the Fourier samples of the\ngradient of the image satisfy an annihilation relation, resulting in a low-rank\ntwo-fold Hankel matrix. In addition, since the singular value decomposition of\na low-rank Hankel matrix corresponds to an adaptive tight frame system which\ncan represent the image with sparse canonical coefficients, our approach\nconsists of the following two stages. The first stage learns the tight wavelet\nframe system from a given measurement, and the second stage restores the image\nvia the analysis approach based sparse regularization. The numerical results\nare presented to demonstrate that the proposed approach is compared favorably\nagainst several popular discrete regularization approaches and structured\nlow-rank matrix approaches.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing public health threat, estimated\nto cause over 10 million deaths per year and cost the global economy 100\ntrillion USD by 2050 under status quo projections. These losses would mainly\nresult from an increase in the morbidity and mortality from treatment failure,\nAMR infections during medical procedures, and a loss of quality of life\nattributed to AMR. Numerous interventions have been proposed to control the\ndevelopment of AMR and mitigate the risks posed by its spread. This paper\nreviews key aspects of bacterial AMR management and control which make\nessential use of data technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine\nlearning, and mathematical and statistical modelling, fields that have seen\nrapid developments in this century. Although data technologies have become an\nintegral part of biomedical research, their impact on AMR management has\nremained modest. We outline the use of data technologies to combat AMR,\ndetailing recent advancements in four complementary categories: surveillance,\nprevention, diagnosis, and treatment. We provide an overview on current AMR\ncontrol approaches using data technologies within biomedical research, clinical\npractice, and in the \"One Health\" context. We discuss the potential impact and\nchallenges wider implementation of data technologies is facing in high-income\nas well as in low- and middle-income countries, and recommend concrete actions\nneeded to allow these technologies to be more readily integrated within the\nhealthcare and public health sectors.",

    "abstract": "Self-sovereign identity is the latest digital identity paradigm that allows\nusers, organizations, and things to manage identity in a decentralized fashion\nwithout any central authority controlling the process of issuing identities and\nverifying assertions. Following this paradigm, implementations have emerged in\nrecent years, with some having different underlying technologies. These\ntechnological differences often create interoperability problems between\nsoftware that interact with each other from different implementations. Although\na common problem, there is no common understanding of self-sovereign identity\ninteroperability. In the context of this tutorial, we create a definition of\ninteroperability of self-sovereign identities to enable a common understanding.\nMoreover, due to the decentralized nature, interoperability of self-sovereign\nidentities depends on multiple components, such as ones responsible for\nestablishing trust or enabling secure communication between entities without\ncentralized authorities. To understand those components and their dependencies,\nwe also present a reference model that maps the required components and\nconsiderations that build up a self-sovereign identity implementation.

    "abstract": "Learning to derive subgoals reduces the gap between experts and students and\nmakes students prepared for future problem solving. Researchers have explored\nsubgoal labeled instructional materials with explanations in traditional\nproblem solving and within tutoring systems to help novices learn to subgoal.\nHowever, only a little research is found on problem-solving strategies in\nrelationship with subgoal learning. Also, these strategies are under-explored\nwithin computer-based tutors and learning environments. Backward\nproblem-solving strategy is closely related to the process of subgoaling, where\nproblem solving iteratively refines the goal into a new subgoal to reduce\ndifficulty. In this paper, we explore a training strategy for backward strategy\nlearning within an intelligent logic tutor that teaches logic proof\nconstruction. The training session involved backward worked examples (BWE) and\nproblem-solving (BPS) to help students learn backward strategy towards\nimproving their subgoaling and problem-solving skills. To evaluate the training\nstrategy, we analyzed students' 1) experience with and engagement in learning\nbackward strategy, 2) performance, and 3) proof construction approaches in new\nproblems that they solved independently without tutor help after each level of\ntraining and in post-test. Our results showed that, when new problems were\ngiven to solve without any tutor help, students who were trained with both BWE\nand BPS outperformed students who received none of the treatment or only BWE\nduring training. Additionally, students trained with both BWE and BPS derived\nsubgoals during proof construction with significantly higher efficiency than\nthe other two groups.",

    "title": "COROID: A Crowdsourcing-based Companion Drones to Tackle Current and  Future Pandemics",
    "abstract": "Due to the current COVID-19 virus, which has already been declared a pandemic\nby the World Health Organization (WHO), we are witnessing the greatest pandemic\nof the decade. Millions of people are being infected, resulting in thousands of\ndeaths every day across the globe. Even it was difficult for the best\nhealthcare-providing countries could not handle the pandemic because of the\nstrain of treating thousands of patients at a time. The count of infections and\ndeaths is increasing at an alarming rate because of the spread of the virus. We\nbelieve that innovative technologies could help reduce pandemics to a certain\nextent until we find a definite solution from the medical field to handle and\ntreat such pandemic situations. Technology innovation has the potential to\nintroduce new technologies that could support people and society during these\ndifficult times. Therefore, this paper proposes the idea of using drones as a\ncompanion to tackle current and future pandemics. Our COROID drone is based on\nthe principle of crowdsourcing sensors data of the public's smart devices,\nwhich can correlate the reading of the infrared cameras equipped on the COROID\ndrones. To the best of our knowledge, this concept has yet to be investigated\neither as a concept or as a product. Therefore, we believe that the COROID\ndrone is innovative and has a huge potential to tackle COVID-19 and future\npandemics.",

    "abstract": "In healthcare, detecting stress and enabling individuals to monitor their\nmental health and wellbeing is challenging. Advancements in wearable technology\nnow enable continuous physiological data collection. This data can provide\ninsights into mental health and behavioural states through psychophysiological\nanalysis. However, automated analysis is required to provide timely results due\nto the quantity of data collected. Machine learning has shown efficacy in\nproviding an automated classification of physiological data for health\napplications in controlled laboratory environments. Ambulatory uncontrolled\nenvironments, however, provide additional challenges requiring further\nmodelling to overcome. This work empirically assesses several approaches\nutilising machine learning classifiers to detect stress using physiological\ndata recorded in an ambulatory setting with self-reported stress annotations. A\nsubset of the training portion SMILE dataset enables the evaluation of\napproaches before submission. The optimal stress detection approach achieves\n90.77% classification accuracy, 91.24 F1-Score, 90.42 Sensitivity and 91.08\nSpecificity, utilising an ExtraTrees classifier and feature imputation methods.\nMeanwhile, accuracy on the challenge data is much lower at 59.23% (submission\n#54 from BEaTS-MTU, username ZacDair).

    "abstract": "Mobile technology creates value on three fundamental pillars: productivity,\ncoordination, and transformation. Mobile apps are becoming an increasingly\nimportant aspect of teaching and learning in many countries. The use of mobile\napplications in education is not only beneficial, but also provides students\nwith an enjoyable and interactive experience. For a mobile product launch to be\nas successful as it can be, it is imperative that a systematic, precise,\ncontrolled, and well-established process is in place, which is controlled,\nefficient, and well-established. Many educational organisation's find\nthemselves in situations where they have to get all departments working\neffectively and together in order to meet a specific deadline, including\nmarketing, production, and operations, after the organization's product\nclearance board approves the new product. In many ways, the situation is\nsimilar to the software crisis that took place in the middle of the 1970's. As\na result of globalisation and communication, oftentimes the effects of\nglobalisation are amplified because of the vast amount of information that must\nbe shared among project team members. Every educational organization has a\nunique style and way of doing things, and the project management team is no\nexception. As a consequence, it is commonplace to see that every education\nentity has its own particular style and way of doing things. In regards to the\ncreation of a mobile application that is going to function efficiently, it is\nimportant to remember that it is extremely important to stick to the strategies\nand requirements that will yield the best results for the education sector.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive learning aims to stimulate and meet the needs of individual\nlearners, which requires sophisticated system-level coordination of diverse\ntasks, including modeling learning resources, estimating student states, and\nmaking personalized recommendations. Existing deep learning methods have\nachieved great success over statistical models; however, they still lack\ngeneralization for diverse tasks and suffer from insufficient capacity since\nthey are composed of highly-coupled task-specific architectures and rely on\nsmall-scale, coarse-grained recommendation scenarios. To realize the idea of\ngeneral adaptive systems proposed in pedagogical theory, with the emerging\npre-training techniques in NLP, we try to conduct a practical exploration on\napplying pre-training to adaptive learning, to propose a unified framework\nbased on data observation and learning style analysis, properly leveraging\nheterogeneous learning elements. Through a series of downstream tasks of\nLearning Recommendation, Learning Resource Evaluation, Knowledge Tracing, and\nDropout Prediction, we find that course structures, text, and knowledge are\nhelpful for modeling and inherently coherent to student non-sequential learning\nbehaviors and that indirectly relevant information included in the pre-training\nfoundation can be shared across downstream tasks to facilitate effectiveness.\nWe finally build a simplified systematic application of adaptive learning and\nreflect on the insights brought back to pedagogy.

International experts were segregated into\ntwo groups salient to this topical area based on both experience ad\nself-identification: infrastructure development and blockchain tokenization.\nTwenty-three projections for 2035, developed from a literature review, case\nstudy analysis, and expert interviews, concerning perspectives of both the\nsupply and demand side for the adoption of blockchain tokenization, were\nassessed in a two-round Delphi analysis. Regulatory, economic, social, and\ntechnological perspectives of tokenization were taken into consideration.\nAssessments were based on both probability and impact of occurrence. Three\ngroups of scenarios resulted from quantitative and qualitative analysis,\nreflecting agreement and differentiation between both expert groups. The\nresults of this study clearly underlined the potential of tokenization in\ninfrastructure. Uncertainties and barriers confronting the technologies'\ndiffusion were discussed.

This column analyses why this changed Circa 2010\nwhen elective subjects across scores of topics become part of mainstream\neducation to reflect the on-going lateral acceleration of Computer Science.\nFundamental discoveries in artificial intelligence, machine learning,\nvirtualization and cloud computing are several decades old. Many core theories\nin data science are centuries old. Yet their leverage exploded only after Circa\n2010, when the stage got set for people-centric problem solving in massive\nscale. This was due in part to the rush of innovative real-world applications\nthat reached the common man through the ubiquitous smart phone.

In math classrooms, teachers might \"funnel\" students towards a\nnormative answer or \"focus\" students to reflect on their own thinking,\ndeepening their understanding of math concepts.

We\npropose the task of computationally detecting funneling and focusing questions\nin classroom discourse. We do so by creating and releasing an annotated dataset\nof 2,348 teacher utterances labeled for funneling and focusing questions, or\nneither. We introduce supervised and unsupervised approaches to differentiating\nthese questions. Our best model, a supervised RoBERTa model fine-tuned on our\ndataset, has a strong linear correlation of .76 with human expert labels and\nwith positive educational outcomes, including math instruction quality and\nstudent achievement, showing the model's potential for use in automated teacher\nfeedback tools.

Recent\ngeneralizing view synthesis methods also leverage the radiance fields but the\nrendering speed is not real-time.

This architecture infers not only\nconsistent scene geometry based on the implicit neural fields but also renders\nnew views efficiently using a single GPU. We first train HRF-Net on multiple 3D\nscenes of the DTU dataset and the network can produce plausible novel views on\nunseen real and synthetics data using only photometric losses. Moreover, our\nmethod can leverage a denser set of reference images of a single scene to\nproduce accurate novel views without relying on additional explicit\nrepresentations and still maintains the high-speed rendering of the pre-trained\nmodel.

    "abstract": "Fatal diseases, as Critical Health Episodes (CHEs), represent real dangers\nfor patients hospitalized in Intensive Care Units. These episodes can lead to\nirreversible organ damage and death. Nevertheless, diagnosing them in time\nwould greatly reduce their inconvenience. This study therefore focused on\nbuilding a highly effective early warning system for CHEs such as Acute\nHypotensive Episodes and Tachycardia Episodes. To facilitate the precocity of\nthe prediction, a gap of one hour was considered between the observation\nperiods (Observation Windows) and the periods during which a critical event can\noccur (Target Windows). The MIMIC II dataset was used to evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed system. This system first includes extracting\nadditional features using three different modes. Then, the feature selection\nprocess allowing the selection of the most relevant features was performed\nusing the Mutual Information Gain feature importance. Finally, the\nhigh-performance predictive model LightGBM was used to perform episode\nclassification. This approach called MIG-LightGBM was evaluated using five\ndifferent metrics: Event Recall (ER), Reduced Precision (RP), average\nAnticipation Time (aveAT), average False Alarms (aveFA), and Event F1-score\n(EF1-score). A method is therefore considered highly efficient for the early\nprediction of CHEs if it exhibits not only a large aveAT but also a large\nEF1-score and a low aveFA. Compared to systems using Extreme Gradient Boosting,\nSupport Vector Classification or Naive Bayes as a predictive model, the\nproposed system was found to be highly dominant. It also confirmed its\nsuperiority over the Layered Learning approach.",

    "abstract": "The application of a nonlinear filtering function to a Linear Feedback Shift\nRegister (LFSR) is a general technique for designing pseudorandom sequence\ngenerators with cryptographic application. In this paper, we investigate the\nequivalence between different nonlinear filtering functions applied to distinct\nLFSRs. It is a well known fact that given a binary sequence generated from a\npair (nonlinear filtering function, LFSR), the same sequence can be generated\nfrom any other LFSR of the same length by using another filtering function.\nHowever, until now no solution has been found for the problem of computing such\nan equivalent. This paper analyzes the specific case in which the reciprocal\nLFSR of a given register is used to generate an equivalent of the original\nnonlinear filtering function. The main advantage of the contribution is that\nweaker equivalents can be computed for any nonlinear filter, in the sense that\nsuch equivalents could be used to cryptanalyze apparently secure generators.\nConsequently, to evaluate the cryptographic resistance of a sequence generator,\nthe weakest equivalent cipher should be determined and not only a particular\ninstance.",

In the meantime, one of us in PL\nhad impulsively launched an unofficial long-term mentoring program, founded on\nchaos and spreadsheets. In January 2021, the latter grew to an official\ncross-institutional long-term mentoring program called SIGPLAN-M; in January\n2022, the former grew to Computer Architecture Long-term Mentoring (CALM).\nThe impacts have been strong: SIGPLAN-M reaches 328 mentees and 234 mentors\nacross 41 countries, and mentees have described it as \"life changing\" and \"a\ncareer saver.\" And while CALM is in its pilot phase -- with 13 mentors and 21\nmentees across 7 countries -- it has received very positive feedback.

The differences of\nthe three attributes between the input images and the photography templates or\nthe guidance images are described in natural language, which is aesthetic\nnatural language guidance (ALG). Also, because of the differences in lighting\nand composition between landscape images and portrait images, we divide the\ninput images into landscape images and portrait images.

As this approach enforces phase\ncontinuity, SawSing can generate singing voices without the phase-discontinuity\nglitch of many existing vocoders. Moreover, the source-filter assumption\nprovides an inductive bias that allows SawSing to be trained on a small amount\nof data.

First, the existing methods often lack the simultaneous\nconsideration of the global stability and local fluctuation of user preference,\nwhich might degrade the learning of a user's current preference. Second, the\nexisting methods often use a scalar based weighting schema to fuse the\nlong-term and short-term preferences, which is too coarse to learn an\nexpressive embedding of current preference. To address the two challenges, we\npropose a novel model called Time Lag aware Sequential Recommendation (TLSRec),\nwhich integrates a hierarchical modeling of user preference and a time lag\nsensitive fine-grained fusion of the long-term and short-term preferences.\nTLSRec employs a hierarchical self-attention network to learn users' preference\nat both global and local time scales, and a neural time gate to adaptively\nregulate the contributions of the long-term and short-term preferences for the\nlearning of a user's current preference at the aspect level and based on the\nlag between the current time and the time of the last behavior of a user.

    "abstract": "Exploiting gradient leakage to reconstruct supposedly private training data,\ngradient inversion attacks are an ubiquitous threat in collaborative learning\nof neural networks. To prevent gradient leakage without suffering from severe\nloss in model performance, recent work proposed a PRivacy EnhanCing mODulE\n(PRECODE) based on variational modeling as extension for arbitrary model\narchitectures. In this work, we investigate the effect of PRECODE on gradient\ninversion attacks to reveal its underlying working principle. We show that\nvariational modeling induces stochasticity on PRECODE's and its subsequent\nlayers' gradients that prevents gradient attacks from convergence. By\npurposefully omitting those stochastic gradients during attack optimization, we\nformulate an attack that can disable PRECODE's privacy preserving effects. To\nensure privacy preservation against such targeted attacks, we propose PRECODE\nwith Partial Perturbation (PPP), as strategic combination of variational\nmodeling and partial gradient perturbation. We conduct an extensive empirical\nstudy on four seminal model architectures and two image classification\ndatasets. We find all architectures to be prone to gradient leakage, which can\nbe prevented by PPP. In result, we show that our approach requires less\ngradient perturbation to effectively preserve privacy without harming model\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "The ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) is an emerging technology\nthat has received much attention in numerous research areas, including\nbiochemistry, medicine, and security applications. However, compared to other\ntypes of sensors, the complexity of ISFETs make it more challenging to achieve\na sensitive, fast and repeatable response. Therefore, various readout circuits\nhave been developed to improve the performance of ISFETs, especially to\neliminate the temperature effect. This paper presents a new approach for a\ntemperature-independent readout circuit that uses the threshold voltage\ndifferences of an ISFET-MOSFET pair. The Linear Technology Simulation Program\nwith Integrated Circuit Emphasis (LTspice) is used to analyze the ISFET\nperformance based on the proposed readout circuit characteristics. A\nmacro-model is used to model ISFET behavior, including the first-level Spice\nmodel for the MOSFET part and Verilog-A to model the surface potential,\nreference electrode, and electrolyte of the ISFET to determine the\nrelationships between variables.In this way, the behavior of the ISFET is\nmonitored by the output voltage of the readout circuit based on a change in the\nelectrolyte's hydrogen potential (pH), determined by the simulation. The\nproposed readout circuit has a temperature coefficient of 11.9 $ppm/{\\deg}C$\nfor a temperature range of 0-100 ${\\deg}C$ and pH between 1 and 13.

    "title": "Learning Mean-Field Control for Delayed Information Load Balancing in  Large Queuing Systems",
    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a great increase in the capacity and parallel\nprocessing power of data centers and cloud services. To fully utilize the said\ndistributed systems, optimal load balancing for parallel queuing architectures\nmust be realized. Existing state-of-the-art solutions fail to consider the\neffect of communication delays on the behaviour of very large systems with many\nclients. In this work, we consider a multi-agent load balancing system, with\ndelayed information, consisting of many clients (load balancers) and many\nparallel queues. In order to obtain a tractable solution, we model this system\nas a mean-field control problem with enlarged state-action space in discrete\ntime through exact discretization. Subsequently, we apply policy gradient\nreinforcement learning algorithms to find an optimal load balancing solution.\nHere, the discrete-time system model incorporates a synchronization delay under\nwhich the queue state information is synchronously broadcasted and updated at\nall clients. We then provide theoretical performance guarantees for our\nmethodology in large systems. Finally, using experiments, we prove that our\napproach is not only scalable but also shows good performance when compared to\nthe state-of-the-art power-of-d variant of the Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ)\nand other policies in the presence of synchronization delays.",

In order for a simulator to be a valuable\ntest bench, it is required that the driving policy animating each traffic agent\nin the scene acts as humans would do while maintaining minimal safety\nguarantees. Learning the driving policies of traffic agents from recorded human\ndriving data or through reinforcement learning seems to be an attractive\nsolution for the generation of realistic and highly interactive traffic\nsituations in uncontrolled intersections or roundabouts. In this work, we show\nthat a trade-off exists between imitating human driving and maintaining safety\nwhen learning driving policies. We do this by comparing how various Imitation\nlearning and Reinforcement learning algorithms perform when applied to the\ndriving task.

    "abstract": "Large-scale undirected weighted networks are usually found in big\ndata-related research fields. It can naturally be quantified as a symmetric\nhigh-dimensional and incomplete (SHDI) matrix for implementing big data\nanalysis tasks. A symmetric non-negative latent-factor-analysis (SNL) model is\nable to efficiently extract latent factors (LFs) from an SHDI matrix. Yet it\nrelies on a constraint-combination training scheme, which makes it lack\nflexibility. To address this issue, this paper proposes an unconstrained\nsymmetric nonnegative latent-factor-analysis (USNL) model. Its main idea is\ntwo-fold: 1) The output LFs are separated from the decision parameters via\nintegrating a nonnegative mapping function into an SNL model; and 2) Stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) is adopted for implementing unconstrained model training\nalong with ensuring the output LFs nonnegativity. Empirical studies on four\nSHDI matrices generated from real big data applications demonstrate that an\nUSNL model achieves higher prediction accuracy of missing data than an SNL\nmodel, as well as highly competitive computational efficiency.",

    "title": "Generalized Reinforcement Learning: Experience Particles, Action  Operator, Reinforcement Field, Memory Association, and Decision Concepts",
    "abstract": "Learning a control policy that involves time-varying and evolving system\ndynamics often poses a great challenge to mainstream reinforcement learning\nalgorithms. In most standard methods, actions are often assumed to be a rigid,\nfixed set of choices that are sequentially applied to the state space in a\npredefined manner. Consequently, without resorting to substantial re-learning\nprocesses, the learned policy lacks the ability in adapting to variations in\nthe action set and the action's \"behavioral\" outcomes. In addition, the\nstandard action representation and the action-induced state transition\nmechanism inherently limit how reinforcement learning can be applied in\ncomplex, real-world applications primarily due to the intractability of the\nresulting large state space and the lack of facility to generalize the learned\npolicy to the unknown part of the state space. This paper proposes a\nBayesian-flavored generalized reinforcement learning framework by first\nestablishing the notion of parametric action model to better cope with\nuncertainty and fluid action behaviors, followed by introducing the notion of\nreinforcement field as a physics-inspired construct established through\n\"polarized experience particles\" maintained in the learning agent's working\nmemory. These particles effectively encode the dynamic learning experience that\nevolves over time in a self-organizing way. On top of the reinforcement field,\nwe will further generalize the policy learning process to incorporate\nhigh-level decision concepts by considering the past memory as having an\nimplicit graph structure, in which the past memory instances (or particles) are\ninterconnected with similarity between decisions defined, and thereby, the\n\"associative memory\" principle can be applied to augment the learning agent's\nworld model.",

However, these algorithms have not been developed\nto pursue the natural evolution of malware, and their performances\nsignificantly degrade over time because of such concept-drift. Currently,\nstate-of-the-art techniques only focus on detecting the presence of such drift,\nor they address it by relying on frequent updates of models. Hence, there is a\nlack of knowledge regarding the cause of the concept drift, and ad-hoc\nsolutions that can counter the passing of time are still under-investigated. In\nthis work, we commence to address these issues as we propose (i) a\ndrift-analysis framework to identify which characteristics of data are causing\nthe drift, and (ii) SVM-CB, a time-aware classifier that leverages the\ndrift-analysis information to slow down the performance drop. We highlight the\nefficacy of our contribution by comparing its degradation over time with a\nstate-of-the-art classifier, and we show that SVM-CB better withstands the\ndistribution changes that naturally characterize the malware domain. We\nconclude by discussing the limitations of our approach and how our contribution\ncan be taken as a first step towards more time-resistant classifiers that not\nonly tackle, but also understand the concept drift that affects data.",

    "abstract": "Through discovery of meso-scale structures, community detection methods\nsupport understanding complex networks. To this purpose, a variety of community\ndetection approaches have been developed. Some have been applied to\nbibliometric data and have resulted in useful discovery. Many community finding\nmethods, however, rely on disjoint clustering techniques, in which node\nmembership is restricted to one community or cluster. This strict requirement\nlimits the ability to inclusively describe communities since some nodes may\nreasonably be assigned to many communities. We previously reported a scalable\nand modular pipeline that discovers disjoint research communities from the\nscientific literature. We now present Assembling Overlapping Clusters (AOC), a\ncomplementary meta-method for overlapping communities as an option that\naddresses this disjoint clustering problem. We present findings from the use of\nAOC on a network of over 13 million nodes that captures recent research in the\nvery rapidly growing field of extracellular vesicles in biology.",

    "abstract": "Large quantifies of online user activity data, such as weekly web search\nvolumes, which co-evolve with the mutual influence of several queries and\nlocations, serve as an important social sensor. It is an important task to\naccurately forecast the future activity by discovering latent interactions from\nsuch data, i.e., the ecosystems between each query and the flow of influences\nbetween each area. However, this is a difficult problem in terms of data\nquantity and complex patterns covering the dynamics.

Our model is the expansion of a combination of two\nmathematical models: a reaction-diffusion system provides a framework for\nmodeling the flow of influences between local area groups and an ecological\nsystem models the latent interactions between each query. Also, by leveraging\nthe concept of physics-informed neural networks, FluxCube achieves high\ninterpretability obtained from the parameters and high forecasting performance,\ntogether. Extensive experiments on real datasets showed that FluxCube\noutperforms comparable models in terms of the forecasting accuracy, and each\ncomponent in FluxCube contributes to the enhanced performance. We then show\nsome case studies that FluxCube can extract useful latent interactions between\nqueries and area groups.",

    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-Everything communications (V2X) are becoming increasingly popular\nas a solution for safer roads and better traffic management. One of the\nessential protocols in V2X is the Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC)\nprotocol suite. DSRC includes the IEEE 802.11p protocol that operates at the\nmedium access control (MAC) and physical (PHY) layers. Upon collision, the IEEE\n802.11p MAC layer applies a carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance\n(CSMA/CA) mechanism that randomly selects a backoff time to re-check the\nchannel activity and then retransmit. However, the random selection of the\nbackoff time may lead to further packet collisions that decrease the\nutilization of the communication channel, which suffers from a limited\nbandwidth in the first place. This paper proposes a fuzzy model based on\nrational decision-making, which we call F-802.11p, to improve the IEEE 802.11p\nprotocol backoff time selection by limiting the IEEE 802.11p beacon messages to\nbetter use of the available bandwidth. A simulation study presents the\nevaluation of our work compared to IEEE 802.11p. We deployed the simulation\nsoftware in two scenarios: the Veins Framework map and the map of New\nAdministrative Cairo in Egypt. We base our comparison on slots backoff, times\ninto backoff, PHY busy time, MAC busy time, total lost packets, and\ngenerated/received beacon messages. Simulation results show that both protocols\nhave comparable results in slots backoff, times into back off, and the\ngenerated beacon messages. At the same time, our F-802.11p significantly\noutperforms the IEEE 802.11p in PHY busy time, MAC busy time, total lost\npackets, and the received beacon messages in both scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Modern electricity grids throughout the world, particularly in islands such\nas Great Britain, face a major problem on the road to decarbonisation: the\nsignificantly reduced level of system inertia due to integration of Renewable\nEnergy Sources (RES). Given that most RES such as wind and solar are decoupled\nfrom the grid through power electronics converters, they do not naturally\ncontribute to system inertia. However, RES could support grid stability through\nappropriately controlling the converters, but currently no market incentives\nexist for RES to provide this support. In this paper we develop a methodology\nto optimally clear a market of ancillary services for frequency control, while\nexplicitly considering the participation of grid-forming and grid-following\ninverter-based technologies. We propose a mathematical framework that allows to\ncompute shadow prices for ancillary services offered by a pool of diverse\nproviders: synchronous and synthetic inertia, enhanced frequency response (e.g.\nfrom curtailed RES) and traditional primary frequency response (e.g. by thermal\ngenerators). Several case studies are run on a simplified Great Britain system,\nto illustrate the applicability and benefits of this pricing scheme.",

    "abstract": "Teams are central to human accomplishment. Over the past half-century,\npsychologists have identified the Big-Five cross-culturally valid personality\nvariables: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Conscientiousness, and\nAgreeableness. The first four have shown consistent relationships with team\nperformance. Agreeableness (being harmonious, altruistic, humble, and\ncooperative), however, has demonstrated a non-significant and highly variable\nrelationship with team performance. We resolve this inconsistency through\ncomputational modelling. An agent-based model (ABM) is used to predict the\neffects of personality traits on teamwork and a genetic algorithm is then used\nto explore the limits of the ABM in order to discover which traits correlate\nwith best and worst performing teams for a problem with different levels of\nuncertainty (noise). New dependencies revealed by the exploration are\ncorroborated by analyzing previously-unseen data from one the largest datasets\non team performance to date comprising 3,698 individuals in 593 teams working\non more than 5,000 group tasks with and without uncertainty, collected over a\n10-year period. Our finding is that the dependency between team performance and\nAgreeableness is moderated by task uncertainty. Combining evolutionary\ncomputation with ABMs in this way provides a new methodology for the scientific\ninvestigation of teamwork, making new predictions, and improving our\nunderstanding of human behaviors. Our results confirm the potential usefulness\nof computer modelling for developing theory, as well as shedding light on the\nfuture of teams as work environments are becoming increasingly fluid and\nuncertain.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent progress on conversational systems, they still do not perform\nsmoothly and coherently when faced with ambiguous requests. When questions are\nunclear, conversational systems should have the ability to ask clarifying\nquestions, rather than assuming a particular interpretation or simply\nresponding that they do not understand. Previous studies have shown that users\nare more satisfied when asked a clarifying question, rather than receiving an\nunrelated response. While the research community has paid substantial attention\nto the problem of predicting query ambiguity in traditional search contexts,\nresearchers have paid relatively little attention to predicting when this\nambiguity is sufficient to warrant clarification in the context of\nconversational systems. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for\npredicting the need for clarification. This method is based on the measured\ncoherency of results from an initial answer retrieval step, under the\nassumption that a less ambiguous query is more likely to retrieve more coherent\nresults when compared to an ambiguous query. We build a graph from retrieved\nitems based on their context similarity, treating measures of graph\nconnectivity as indicators of ambiguity.

    "abstract": "Despite the advantages of their low-resource settings, traditional sparse\nretrievers depend on exact matching approaches between high-dimensional\nbag-of-words (BoW) representations of both the queries and the collection. As a\nresult, retrieval performance is restricted by semantic discrepancies and\nvocabulary gaps. On the other hand, transformer-based dense retrievers\nintroduce significant improvements on information retrieval tasks by exploiting\nlow-dimensional contextualized representations of the corpus. While dense\nretrievers are known for their relative effectiveness, they suffer from lower\nefficiency and lack of generalization issues, when compared to sparse\nretrievers. For a light-weight retrieval task, high computational resources and\ntime consumption are major barriers encouraging the renunciation of dense\nmodels despite potential gains. In this work, we propose boosting the\nperformance of sparse retrievers by expanding both the queries and the\ndocuments with linked entities in two formats for the entity names: 1) explicit\nand 2) hashed. We employ a zero-shot end-to-end dense entity linking system for\nentity recognition and disambiguation to augment the corpus. By leveraging the\nadvanced entity linking methods, we believe that the effectiveness gap between\nsparse and dense retrievers can be narrowed. We conduct our experiments on the\nMS MARCO passage dataset. Since we are concerned with the early stage retrieval\nin cascaded ranking architectures of large information retrieval systems, we\nevaluate our results using recall@1000. Our approach is also capable of\nretrieving documents for query subsets judged to be particularly difficult in\nprior work.

Fortunately, all of these resources are mediated\nby the operating system's kernel. User programs, malware included, interacts\nwith system resources by making requests to the kernel with system calls.\nCollecting these system calls provide insight to the interaction with many\nsystem resources in a single location. Feeding these system calls into a\nperformant model such as a random forest allows fast, accurate classification\nin certain situations. In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of using\nsystem call sequences for online malware classification in both low-activity\nand heavy-use Cloud IaaS. We collect system calls as they are received by the\nkernel and take n-gram sequences of calls to use as features for tree-based\nmachine learning models. We discuss the performance of the models on baseline\nsystems with no extra running services and systems under heavy load and the\nperformance gap between them.",

For these\nreasons, OSNs data mining and analysis aimed at detecting disinformation\ncampaigns that may arm the society and, more in general, poison the democratic\nposture of states, are essential activities during key events such as\nelections, pandemics, and conflicts. In this paper, we studied the 2022\nRusso-Ukrainian conflict on Twitter, one of the most used OSNs.

Chemotherapy\nresponse is used for predicting prognosis and further management of patients.\nNecrosis is routinely assessed post-chemotherapy from histology slides on\nresection specimens where necrosis ratio is defined as the ratio of necrotic\ntumor to overall tumor. Patients with necrosis ratio >=90% are known to have\nbetter outcome. Manual microscopic review of necrosis ratio from multiple glass\nslides is semi-quantitative and can have intra- and inter-observer variability.\nWe propose an objective and reproducible deep learning-based approach to\nestimate necrosis ratio with outcome prediction from scanned hematoxylin and\neosin whole slide images. We collected 103 osteosarcoma cases with 3134 WSIs to\ntrain our deep learning model, to validate necrosis ratio assessment, and to\nevaluate outcome prediction. We trained Deep Multi-Magnification Network to\nsegment multiple tissue subtypes including viable tumor and necrotic tumor in\npixel-level and to calculate case-level necrosis ratio from multiple WSIs. We\nshowed necrosis ratio estimated by our segmentation model highly correlates\nwith necrosis ratio from pathology reports manually assessed by experts where\nmean absolute differences for Grades IV (100%), III (>=90%), and II (>=50% and\n<90%) necrosis response are 4.4%, 4.5%, and 17.8%, respectively. We\nsuccessfully stratified patients to predict overall survival with p=10^-6 and\nprogression-free survival with p=0.012. Our reproducible approach without\nvariability enabled us to tune cutoff thresholds, specifically for our model\nand our data set, to 80% for OS and 60% for PFS. Our study indicates deep\nlearning can support pathologists as an objective tool to analyze osteosarcoma\nfrom histology for assessing treatment response and predicting patient outcome.",

Second, based upon this theory we predict that\nswitching the activation function to a piecewise linear B-spline, namely the\nHat function, will remove this spectral bias, which we verify empirically in a\nvariety of settings. Our empirical studies also show that neural networks with\nthe Hat activation function are trained significantly faster using stochastic\ngradient descent and ADAM. Combined with previous work showing that the Hat\nactivation function also improves generalization accuracy on image\nclassification tasks, this indicates that using the Hat activation provides\nsignificant advantages over the ReLU on certain problems.",

We first show that this new measure captures at once\nthe complexity of several seemingly-unrelated hard problems on automata. Any\nNFA of co-lex width $p$: (i) has an equivalent powerset DFA whose size is\nexponential in $p$ rather than (as a classic analysis shows) in the NFA's size;\n(ii) can be encoded using just $\\Theta(\\log p)$ bits per transition; (iii)\nadmits a linear-space data structure solving regular expression matching\nqueries in time proportional to $p^2$ per matched character. Some consequences\nof this new parameterization of automata are that PSPACE-hard problems such as\nNFA equivalence are FPT in $p$, and quadratic lower bounds for the regular\nexpression matching problem do not hold for sufficiently small $p$. Having\nestablished that the co-lex width of an automaton is a fundamental complexity\nmeasure, we proceed by (i) determining its computational complexity and (ii)\nextending this notion from automata to regular languages by studying their\nsmallest-width accepting NFAs and DFAs. In this work we focus on the\ndeterministic case and prove that a canonical minimum-width DFA accepting a\nlanguage $\\mathcal L$ - dubbed the Hasse automaton $\\mathcal H$ of $\\mathcal L$\n- can be exhibited.

Recently, models using structured state space sequence (S4) layers\nachieved state-of-the-art performance on many long-range tasks. The S4 layer\ncombines linear state space models (SSMs) with deep learning techniques and\nleverages the HiPPO framework for online function approximation to achieve high\nperformance. However, this framework led to architectural constraints and\ncomputational difficulties that make the S4 approach complicated to understand\nand implement. We revisit the idea that closely following the HiPPO framework\nis necessary for high performance. Specifically, we replace the bank of many\nindependent single-input, single-output (SISO) SSMs the S4 layer uses with one\nmulti-input, multi-output (MIMO) SSM with a reduced latent dimension. The\nreduced latent dimension of the MIMO system allows for the use of efficient\nparallel scans which simplify the computations required to apply the S5 layer\nas a sequence-to-sequence transformation. In addition, we initialize the state\nmatrix of the S5 SSM with an approximation to the HiPPO-LegS matrix used by\nS4's SSMs and show that this serves as an effective initialization for the MIMO\nsetting.

Because of its Bayesian foundations, the\nBayesian Bradley Terry model (BBT) has different characteristics than\nfrequentist approaches to comparing multiple algorithms on multiple data sets,\nsuch as Demsar (2006) tests on mean rank, and Benavoli et al. (2016) multiple\npairwise Wilcoxon tests with p-adjustment procedures. In particular, a Bayesian\napproach allows for more nuanced statements regarding the algorithms beyond\nclaiming that the difference is or it is not statistically significant.\nBayesian approaches also allow to define when two algorithms are equivalent for\npractical purposes, or the region of practical equivalence (ROPE). Different\nthan a Bayesian signed rank comparison procedure proposed by Benavoli et al.\n(2017), our approach can define a ROPE for any metric, since it is based on\nprobability statements, and not on differences of that metric. This paper also\nproposes a local ROPE concept, that evaluates whether a positive difference\nbetween a mean measure across some cross validation to the mean of some other\nalgorithms is should be really seen as the first algorithm being better than\nthe second, based on effect sizes.

In the\npresent study, we proposed using neighborhood regularized bidirectional matrix\nfactorization (NRBdMF) to predict drug effects by incorporating\nbidirectionality, which is a characteristic property of drug effects. We used\nthis proposed method for predicting side effects using a matrix that considered\nthe bidirectionality of drug effects, in which known side effects were assigned\na positive label (plus 1) and known treatment effects were assigned a negative\n(minus 1) label. The NRBdMF model, which utilizes drug bidirectional\ninformation, achieved enrichment of side effects at the top and indications at\nthe bottom of the prediction list. This first attempt to consider the\nbidirectional nature of drug effects using NRBdMF showed that it reduced false\npositives and produced a highly interpretable output.",

    "abstract": "Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is an important molecule family in the field of\nhuman immunity, which recognizes foreign threats and triggers immune responses\nby presenting peptides to T cells. In recent years, the synthesis of tumor\nvaccines to induce specific immune responses has become the forefront of cancer\ntreatment. Computationally modeling the binding patterns between peptide and\nHLA can greatly accelerate the development of tumor vaccines. However, most of\nthe prediction methods performance is very limited and they cannot fully take\nadvantage of the analysis of existing biological knowledge as the basis of\nmodeling. In this paper, we propose TripHLApan, a novel pan-specific prediction\nmodel, for HLA molecular peptide binding prediction. TripHLApan exhibits\npowerful prediction ability by integrating triple coding matrix, BiGRU +\nAttention models, and transfer learning strategy. The comprehensive evaluations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of TripHLApan in predicting HLA-I and HLA-II\npeptide binding in different test environments. The predictive power of HLA-I\nis further demonstrated in the latest data set. In addition, we show that\nTripHLApan has strong binding reconstitution ability in the samples of a\nmelanoma patient. In conclusion, TripHLApan is a powerful tool for predicting\nthe binding of HLA-I and HLA-II molecular peptides for the synthesis of tumor\nvaccines.",

    "abstract": "Image representation is critical for many visual tasks. Instead of\nrepresenting images discretely with 2D arrays of pixels, a recent study, namely\nlocal implicit image function (LIIF), denotes images as a continuous function\nwhere pixel values are expansion by using the corresponding coordinates as\ninputs. Due to its continuous nature, LIIF can be adopted for arbitrary-scale\nimage super-resolution tasks, resulting in a single effective and efficient\nmodel for various up-scaling factors. However, LIIF often suffers from\nstructural distortions and ringing artifacts around edges, mostly because all\npixels share the same model, thus ignoring the local properties of the image.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel adaptive local image function (A-LIIF) to\nalleviate this problem. Specifically, our A-LIIF consists of two main\ncomponents: an encoder and a expansion network. The former captures cross-scale\nimage features, while the latter models the continuous up-scaling function by a\nweighted combination of multiple local implicit image functions. Accordingly,\nour A-LIIF can reconstruct the high-frequency textures and structures more\naccurately. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness\nof our method.

    "abstract": "The power consumption of high-speed, high-resolution analog to digital\nconverters (ADCs) is a limiting factor in implementing large-bandwidth mm-wave\ncommunication systems. A mitigating solution, which has drawn considerable\nrecent interest, is to use a few low-resolution ADCs at the receiver. While\nreducing the number and resolution of the ADCs decreases power consumption, it\nalso leads to a reduction in channel capacity due to the information loss\ninduced by coarse quantization. This implies a rate-energy tradeoff governed by\nthe number and resolution of ADCs. Recently, it was shown that given a fixed\nnumber of low-resolution ADCs, the application of practically implementable\nnonlinear analog operators, prior to sampling and quantization, may\nsignificantly reduce the aforementioned rate-loss. Building upon these\nobservations, this work focuses on single-input single-output (SISO)\ncommunication scenarios, and i) characterizes capacity expressions under\nvarious assumptions on the set of implementable nonlinear analog functions, ii)\nprovides computational methods to calculate the channel capacity numerically,\nand iii) quantifies the gains due to the use of nonlinear operators in SISO\nreceiver terminals.

To this end, we proposed a layer attention-based\nnoise-tolerant network, termed LANTNet.

However, the one-to-many correspondence\nbetween a patient and multiple TCR sequences hinders researchers from simply\nadopting classical statistical/machine learning methods. There were recent\nattempts to model this type of data in the context of multiple instance\nlearning (MIL).\nDespite the novel application of MIL to cancer detection using TCR sequences\nand the demonstrated adequate performance in several tumor types, there is\nstill room for improvement, especially for certain cancer types. Furthermore,\nexplainable neural network models are not fully investigated for this\napplication.\nIn this article, we propose multiple instance neural networks based on sparse\nattention (MINN-SA) to enhance the performance in cancer detection and\nexplainability. The sparse attention structure drops out uninformative\ninstances in each bag, achieving both interpretability and better predictive\nperformance in combination with the skip connection.\nOur experiments show that MINN-SA yields the highest area under the ROC curve\n(AUC) scores on average measured across 10 different types of cancers, compared\nto existing MIL approaches.

In this paper, we propose a\nmethod that using a Stacking Deep Neural Network to detect the Covid 19 through\nthe series of 3D CT-scans images . In our method, we experiment with two\nbackbones are DenseNet 121 and ResNet 101. This method achieves a competitive\nperformance on some evaluation metrics",

    "abstract": "When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.",

The growth of the\nextrameatal regions is a key factor that determines the disease management\nfollowed by the clinicians. In this work, a VS segmentation approach with\nsubdivision into intra-/extra-meatal parts is presented. We annotated a dataset\nconsisting of 227 T2 MRI instances, acquired longitudinally on 137 patients,\nexcluding post-operative instances.

To improve on the accuracy of the predicted\nmeatal boundary, we introduce a task-specific loss which we call Boundary\nDistance Loss. The performance is evaluated in contrast to the direct\nintrameatal extrameatal segmentation task performance, i.e. the Baseline.

Its early detection\nand diagnosis are crucial for controlling the further spread. Many deep\nlearning-based methods have been proposed to assist clinicians in automatic\nCOVID-19 diagnosis based on computed tomography imaging. However, challenges\nstill remain, including low data diversity in existing datasets, and\nunsatisfied detection resulting from insufficient accuracy and sensitivity of\ndeep learning models. To enhance the data diversity, we design augmentation\ntechniques of incremental levels and apply them to the largest open-access\nbenchmark dataset, COVIDx CT-2A. Meanwhile, similarity regularization (SR)\nderived from contrastive learning is proposed in this study to enable CNNs to\nlearn more parameter-efficient representations, thus improving the accuracy and\nsensitivity of CNNs. The results on seven commonly used CNNs demonstrate that\nCNN performance can be improved stably through applying the designed\naugmentation and SR techniques. In particular, DenseNet121 with SR achieves an\naverage test accuracy of 99.44% in three trials for three-category\nclassification, including normal, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and COVID-19\npneumonia. And the achieved precision, sensitivity, and specificity for the\nCOVID-19 pneumonia category are 98.40%, 99.59%, and 99.50%, respectively.

    "title": "Quantization enabled Privacy Protection in Decentralized Stochastic  Optimization",
    "abstract": "By enabling multiple agents to cooperatively solve a global optimization\nproblem in the absence of a central coordinator, decentralized stochastic\noptimization is gaining increasing attention in areas as diverse as machine\nlearning, control, and sensor networks. Since the associated data usually\ncontain sensitive information, such as user locations and personal identities,\nprivacy protection has emerged as a crucial need in the implementation of\ndecentralized stochastic optimization. In this paper, we propose a\ndecentralized stochastic optimization algorithm that is able to guarantee\nprovable convergence accuracy even in the presence of aggressive quantization\nerrors that are proportional to the amplitude of quantization inputs. The\nresult applies to both convex and non-convex objective functions, and enables\nus to exploit aggressive quantization schemes to obfuscate shared information,\nand hence enables privacy protection without losing provable optimization\naccuracy. In fact, by using a {stochastic} ternary quantization scheme, which\nquantizes any value to three numerical levels, we achieve quantization-based\nrigorous differential privacy in decentralized stochastic optimization, which\nhas not been reported before. In combination with the presented quantization\nscheme, the proposed algorithm ensures, for the first time, rigorous\ndifferential privacy in decentralized stochastic optimization without losing\nprovable convergence accuracy. Simulation results for a distributed estimation\nproblem as well as numerical experiments for decentralized learning on a\nbenchmark machine learning dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach.",

    "abstract": "Molecular property prediction is of crucial importance in many disciplines\nsuch as drug discovery, molecular biology, or material and process design. The\nfrequently employed quantitative structure-property/activity relationships\n(QSPRs/QSARs) characterize molecules by descriptors which are then mapped to\nthe properties of interest via a linear or nonlinear model. In contrast, graph\nneural networks, a novel machine learning method, directly work on the\nmolecular graph, i.e., a graph representation where atoms correspond to nodes\nand bonds correspond to edges. GNNs allow to learn properties in an end-to-end\nfashion, thereby avoiding the need for informative descriptors as in\nQSPRs/QSARs. GNNs have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art prediction\nperformance on various property predictions tasks and represent an active field\nof research. We describe the fundamentals of GNNs and demonstrate the\napplication of GNNs via two examples for molecular property prediction.",

    "abstract": "We formulate a class of physics-driven deep latent variable models (PDDLVM)\nto learn parameter-to-solution (forward) and solution-to-parameter (inverse)\nmaps of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). Our formulation\nleverages the finite element method (FEM), deep neural networks, and\nprobabilistic modeling to assemble a deep probabilistic framework in which the\nforward and inverse maps are approximated with coherent uncertainty\nquantification. Our probabilistic model explicitly incorporates a parametric\nPDE-based density and a trainable solution-to-parameter network while the\nintroduced amortized variational family postulates a parameter-to-solution\nnetwork, all of which are jointly trained. Furthermore, the proposed\nmethodology does not require any expensive PDE solves and is physics-informed\nonly at training time, which allows real-time emulation of PDEs and generation\nof inverse problem solutions after training, bypassing the need for FEM solve\noperations with comparable accuracy to FEM solutions. The proposed framework\nfurther allows for a seamless integration of observed data for solving inverse\nproblems and building generative models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method on a nonlinear Poisson problem, elastic shells with complex 3D\ngeometries, and integrating generic physics-informed neural networks (PINN)\narchitectures. We achieve up to three orders of magnitude speed-ups after\ntraining compared to traditional FEM solvers, while outputting coherent\nuncertainty estimates.",

However, the employment of such a database is limited or\nshows suboptimal performance due to the realism gap, missing textures, and the\nsimplified appearance of simulated images. In this work we 1) provide image\nsimulation on virtual XCAT subjects with varying anatomies, and 2) propose\nsim2real translation network to improve image realism.
