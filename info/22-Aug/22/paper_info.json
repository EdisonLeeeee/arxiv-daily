    "abstract": "In this study, we investigate how the central nervous system (CNS) organizes\npostural control synergies when individuals perform a complex catch-and-throw\ntask in a virtual reality (VR) environment. A Robotic Upright Stand Trainer\n(RobUST) platform, including surface electromyography and kinematics, was used\nto investigate how the CNS fine-tunes postural synergies with perturbative and\nassist-as-needed force fields. A control group without assistive forces was\nrecruited to elucidate the effect of force fields on motor performance and\npostural synergy organization after the perturbation and during the VR reaching\ntask. We found that the application of assistive forces significantly improved\nreaching and balance control. The group receiving assistive forces displayed\nfour postural control synergies characterized by higher complexity (i.e.,\ngreater number of muscles involved). However, control subjects displayed eight\nsynergies that recruited less number of muscles. In conclusion, assistive\nforces reduce the number of postural synergies while increasing the complexity\nof muscle module composition.",

    "title": "Verifiable Differential Privacy For When The Curious Become Dishonest",
    "abstract": "Many applications seek to produce differentially private statistics on\nsensitive data. Traditional approaches in the centralised model rely on a\ntrusted aggregator to gather the raw data, aggregate statistics and introduce\nappropriate noise. Recent work has tried to relax the trust assumptions and\nreduce the need for trusted entities. However, such systems can trade off trust\nfor increased noise and still require complete trust in some participants.\nMoreover, they do not prevent a malicious entity from introducing adversarial\nnoise to skew the result or unmask some inputs.\nIn this paper, we introduce the notion of ``verifiable differential privacy\nwith covert security''. The purpose is to ensure both privacy of the client's\ndata and assurance that the output is not subject to any form of adversarial\nmanipulation. The result is that everyone is assured that the noise used for\ndifferential privacy has been generated correctly, but no one can determine\nwhat the noise was. In the event of a malicious entity attempting to pervert\nthe protocol, their actions will be detected with a constant probability\nnegligibly close to one. We show that such verifiable privacy is practical and\ncan be implemented at scale.",

    "abstract": "Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale\nquadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a\nvariety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering\netc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup\nattention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as\nsparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we\nview attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use\ndecision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per\nquery token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such\nhierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two\nefficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention\ncomputes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse\nattention layer which also ensures that the gradients are \"dense\". To optimize\nsuch challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training\nmethod. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for\nlong-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost\nas accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the\nattention layer.

Since encoder-decoder models can learn\nrepresentations with ``holes'' of invalid samples, here we propose a novel\nextension to the training procedure which promotes a dense latent space, and\nallows the model to sample valid molecules from random perturbations of latent\ncodes. We provide a thorough comparison of MolMIM to several variable-size and\nfixed-size encoder-decoder models, demonstrating MolMIM's superior generation\nas measured in terms of validity, uniqueness, and novelty. We then utilize\nCMA-ES, a naive black-box and gradient free search algorithm, over MolMIM's\nlatent space for the task of property guided molecule optimization.

VAuLT is an\nextension of the popular Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT), and improves\nperformance on vision-and-language tasks that involve more complex text inputs\nthan image captions while having minimal impact on training and inference\nefficiency. ViLT, importantly, enables efficient training and inference in\nvision-and-language tasks, achieved by using a shallow image encoder. However,\nit is pretrained on captioning and similar datasets, where the language input\nis simple, literal, and descriptive, therefore lacking linguistic diversity.\nSo, when working with multimedia data in the wild, such as multimodal social\nmedia data (in our work, Twitter), there is a notable shift from captioning\nlanguage data, as well as diversity of tasks, and we indeed find evidence that\nthe language capacity of ViLT is lacking instead. The key insight of VAuLT is\nto propagate the output representations of a large language model like BERT to\nthe language input of ViLT. We show that such a strategy significantly improves\nover ViLT on vision-and-language tasks involving richer language inputs and\naffective constructs, such as TWITTER-2015, TWITTER-2017, MVSA-Single and\nMVSA-Multiple, but lags behind pure reasoning tasks such as the Bloomberg\nTwitter Text-Image Relationship dataset.

Most existing approaches follow a two-stage pipeline:\nperforming class-agnostic detection first and then class-specific mask\nsegmentation. In contrast, this paper proposes a single-stage framework to\nproduce a mask for each instance directly. Also, instance mask annotations\ncould be noisy in the existing datasets; to overcome this issue, we introduce a\nnew regularization loss. Specifically, we first train an extra branch to\nperform an auxiliary task of predicting foreground regions (i.e. regions\nbelonging to any object instance), and then encourage the prediction from the\nauxiliary branch to be consistent with the predictions of the instance masks.\nThe key insight is that such a cross-task consistency loss could act as an\nerror-correcting mechanism to combat the errors in annotations. Further, we\ndiscover that the proposed cross-task consistency loss can be applied to images\nwithout any annotation, lending itself to a semi-supervised learning method.\nThrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method can\nachieve impressive results in both fully-supervised and semi-supervised\nsettings.

This task lies at the heart of many\napplications in computational science and engineering -- notably, those arising\nfrom parametric modelling and uncertainty quantification. It is common to use\nMonte Carlo (MC) sampling in such applications, so as not to succumb to the\ncurse of dimensionality. However, it is well known this strategy is\ntheoretically suboptimal. There are many polynomial spaces of dimension $n$ for\nwhich the sample complexity scales log-quadratically in $n$. This\nwell-documented phenomenon has led to a concerted effort to design improved, in\nfact, near-optimal strategies, whose sample complexities scale log-linearly, or\neven linearly in $n$.\nParadoxically, in this work we show that MC is actually a perfectly good\nstrategy in high dimensions. We first document this phenomenon via several\nnumerical examples. Next, we present a theoretical analysis that resolves this\nparadox for holomorphic functions of infinitely-many variables. We show that\nthere is a least-squares scheme based on $m$ MC samples whose error decays\nalgebraically fast in $m/\\log(m)$, with a rate that is the same as that of the\nbest $n$-term polynomial approximation. This result is non-constructive, since\nit assumes knowledge of a suitable polynomial space in which to perform the\napproximation. We next present a compressed sensing-based scheme that achieves\nthe same rate, except for a larger polylogarithmic factor. This scheme is\npractical, and numerically it performs as well as or better than well-known\nadaptive least-squares schemes.\nOverall, our findings demonstrate that MC sampling is eminently suitable for\nsmooth function approximation when the dimension is sufficiently high.

To reduce the\nproblem's complexity, we have used the Gaussian curvature to classify stencils\nand fit our models separately to non-saddle and saddle patterns. Non-saddle\nstencils are easier to handle because they exhibit a curvature error\ndistribution characterized by monotonicity and symmetry.

    "abstract": "The most accurate version of the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) involves the\nconstruction of two ensembles. To reduce computational cost, however, UKF is\noften implemented without the second ensemble. This simplification comes at a\nprice, however, since, for linear systems, the one-step variation of the\ntwo-step UKF does not specialize to the classical Kalman filter, with an\nassociated loss of accuracy. This paper remedies this drawback by developing a\nmodified one-step UKF that recovers the classical Kalman filter for linear\nsystems. Numerical examples show that the modified one-step UKF also recovers\nthe accuracy of the two-step UKF in nonlinear systems with linear outputs.",

    "abstract": "Utilization of internet in everyday life has made us vulnerable in terms of\nprivacy and security of our data and systems. Therefore, there are pressing\nneeds to protect our data and systems by improving authentication mechanisms,\nwhich needs to be low cost, unobtrusive, and ideally ubiquitous in nature.\nBehavioral biometrics modalities such as mouse dynamics (i.e., mouse behaviors\non a graphical user interface-GUI) and widget interactions (i.e., another\nmodality closely related to mouse dynamics that also considers the target\n(widget) of a GUI interaction, such as links, button, and combo-box) can\nbolster the security of existing authentication systems because of their\nability to distinguish an individual based on their unique features. As a\nresult, it can be difficult for an imposter to impersonate these behavioral\nbiometrics, making them suitable for authentication. In this paper, we survey\nthe literature on mouse dynamics and widget interactions dated from 1897 to\n2021. We begin our survey with an account of the psychological perspectives on\nbehavioral biometrics. We then analyze the literature along the following\ndimensions: tasks and experimental settings for data collection, taxonomy of\nraw attributes, feature extractions and mathematical definitions, publicly\navailable datasets, algorithms (statistical, machine learning, and deep\nlearning), fusion and performance, and limitations. Lastly, we end the paper\nwith presenting more opportunities for future research",

Among the top 20 California wildfires, those in 2020-2021 burned more\nacres than the last century combined. California's 2018 wildfire season caused\ndamages of $148.5 billion. Among millions of impacted people, those living with\ndisabilities (around 15% of the world population) are disproportionately\nimpacted due to inadequate means of alerts. In this project, a multi-modal\nwildfire prediction and personalized early warning system has been developed\nbased on an advanced machine learning architecture. Sensor data from the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency and historical wildfire data from 2012 to 2018\nhave been compiled to establish a comprehensive wildfire database, the largest\nof its kind. Next, a novel U-Convolutional-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural\nnetwork was designed with a special architecture for extracting key spatial and\ntemporal features from contiguous environmental parameters indicative of\nimpending wildfires. Environmental and meteorological factors were incorporated\ninto the database and classified as leading indicators and trailing indicators,\ncorrelated to risks of wildfire conception and propagation respectively.\nAdditionally, geological data was used to provide better wildfire risk\nassessment. This novel spatio-temporal neural network achieved >97% accuracy\nvs. around 76% using traditional convolutional neural networks, successfully\npredicting 2018's five most devastating wildfires 5-14 days in advance.\nFinally, a personalized early warning system, tailored to individuals with\nsensory disabilities or respiratory exacerbation conditions, was proposed.

    "abstract": "Background. Containerization technologies are widely adopted in the DevOps\nworkflow. The most commonly used one is Docker, which requires developers to\ndefine a specification file (Dockerfile) to build the image used for creating\ncontainers. There are several best practice rules for writing Dockerfiles, but\nthe developers do not always follow them. Violations of such practices, known\nas Dockerfile smells, can negatively impact the reliability and the performance\nof Docker images. Previous studies showed that Dockerfile smells are widely\ndiffused, and there is a lack of automatic tools that support developers in\nfixing them. However, it is still unclear what Dockerfile smells get fixed by\ndevelopers and to what extent developers would be willing to fix smells in the\nfirst place.\nObjective. The aim of our exploratory study is twofold. First, we want to\nunderstand what Dockerfiles smells receive more attention from developers,\ni.e., are fixed more frequently in the history of open-source projects. Second,\nwe want to check if developers are willing to accept changes aimed at fixing\nDockerfile smells (e.g., generated by an automated tool), to understand if they\ncare about them.\nMethod. In the first part of the study, we will evaluate the survivability of\nDockerfile smells on a state-of-the-art dataset composed of 9.4M unique\nDockerfiles. We rely on a state-of-the-art tool (hadolint) for detecting which\nDockerfile smells disappear during the evolution of Dockerfiles, and we will\nmanually analyze a large sample of such cases to understand if developers fixed\nthem and if they were aware of the smell. In the second part, we will detect\nsmelly Dockerfiles on a set of GitHub projects, and we will use a rule-based\ntool to automatically fix them. Finally, we will open pull requests proposing\nthe modifications to developers, and we will quantitatively and qualitatively\nevaluate their outcome.",

The field promises improved performance for\nvarious facilities such as labs, research and development pipelines, and\nwarehouses. As autonomous systems grow in number, capability, and complexity, a\nnew challenge arises - how will these systems work together across large\nfacilities? We explore one solution to this question - a multi-agent framework.\nWe demonstrate a framework with 1) a simulated facility with realistic resource\nlimits such as equipment use limits, 2) machine learning agents with diverse\nlearning capabilities and goals, control over lab instruments, and the ability\nto run research campaigns, and 3) a network over which these agents can share\nknowledge and work together to achieve individual or collective goals.

MULTITASK allows facility-wide simulations including\nagent-instrument and agent-agent interactions. Framework modularity allows\nreal-world autonomous spaces to come on-line in phases, with simulated\ninstruments gradually replaced by real-world instruments.

    "abstract": "Standard deep reinforcement learning (DRL) aims to maximize expected reward,\nconsidering collected experiences equally in formulating a policy. This differs\nfrom human decision-making, where gains and losses are valued differently and\noutlying outcomes are given increased consideration. It also fails to\ncapitalize on opportunities to improve safety and/or performance through the\nincorporation of distributional context. Several approaches to distributional\nDRL have been investigated, with one popular strategy being to evaluate the\nprojected distribution of returns for possible actions. We propose a more\ndirect approach whereby risk-sensitive objectives, specified in terms of the\ncumulative distribution function (CDF) of the distribution of full-episode\nrewards, are optimized. This approach allows for outcomes to be weighed based\non relative quality, can be used for both continuous and discrete action\nspaces, and may naturally be applied in both constrained and unconstrained\nsettings. We show how to compute an asymptotically consistent estimate of the\npolicy gradient for a broad class of risk-sensitive objectives via sampling,\nsubsequently incorporating variance reduction and regularization measures to\nfacilitate effective on-policy learning. We then demonstrate that the use of\nmoderately \"pessimistic\" risk profiles, which emphasize scenarios where the\nagent performs poorly, leads to enhanced exploration and a continual focus on\naddressing deficiencies. We test the approach using different risk profiles in\nsix OpenAI Safety Gym environments, comparing to state of the art on-policy\nmethods. Without cost constraints, we find that pessimistic risk profiles can\nbe used to reduce cost while improving total reward accumulation. With cost\nconstraints, they are seen to provide higher positive rewards than risk-neutral\napproaches at the prescribed allowable cost.",

    "title": "3M: An Effective Multi-view, Multi-granularity, and Multi-aspect  Modeling Approach to English Pronunciation Assessment",
    "abstract": "As an indispensable ingredient of computer-assisted pronunciation training\n(CAPT), automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) plays a pivotal role in aiding\nself-directed language learners by providing multi-aspect and timely feedback.\nHowever, there are at least two potential obstacles that might hinder its\nperformance for practical use. On one hand, most of the studies focus\nexclusively on leveraging segmental (phonetic)-level features such as goodness\nof pronunciation (GOP); this, however, may cause a discrepancy of feature\ngranularity when performing suprasegmental (prosodic)-level pronunciation\nassessment. On the other hand, automatic pronunciation assessments still suffer\nfrom the lack of large-scale labeled speech data of non-native speakers, which\ninevitably limits the performance of pronunciation assessment. In this paper,\nwe tackle these problems by integrating multiple prosodic and phonological\nfeatures to provide a multi-view, multi-granularity, and multi-aspect (3M)\npronunciation modeling. Specifically, we augment GOP with prosodic and\nself-supervised learning (SSL) features, and meanwhile develop a\nvowel/consonant positional embedding for a more phonology-aware automatic\npronunciation assessment. A series of experiments conducted on the\npublicly-available speechocean762 dataset show that our approach can obtain\nsignificant improvements on several assessment granularities in comparison with\nprevious work, especially on the assessment of speaking fluency and speech\nprosody.",

    "abstract": "In response to the damage to electric power transmission systems caused by\ntyphoon disasters in coastal areas, a planning-targeted resilience assessment\nframework that considers the impact of multiple factors is established to\naccurately find the weak links of the transmission system and improve the\nsystem resilience. Firstly, this paper constructs the attenuation model of the\nwind field and the comprehensive failure model of the system, in which the\nmodel drive to establish the cumulative failure model of the transmission\nsystem is adopted, and multiple data-driven schemes to correct the cumulative\nfailure rate by relying on the feature factor information of the transmission\nsystem is adopted. At the same time, an analytic hierarchy process-weighted\narithmetic averaging (AHP-WAA) method is introduced to select the optimal\ndata-driven evaluation scheme. Secondly, this paper adopts the\nimpact-increment-based state enumeration (IISE) method to establish resilience\nindicators for systems and corridors separately. On this basis, the optimal\npromotion strategy is selected according to the construction difficulty,\nresilience improvement ability, and cost analysis. Finally, simulations on the\nIEEE RTS-79 system have been carried out considering the influence of the real\ntyphoon scenarios, micro-topographic and transmission corridor information\nfactors. The results demonstrate that the hybrid-driven system resilience\nassessment and improvement method can assist planners in accurately judging the\nresilience level of the system against typhoon disasters and selecting the best\nresilience improvement strategy based on the cost-effectiveness ratio.",

UniRLTest extracts\nthe GUI widgets from GUI pages and characterizes the GUI corresponding layouts,\nembedding the GUI pages as states. UniRLTest explores apps with the guidance of\na novelly designed curiosity-driven strategy, which uses a Q-network to\nestimate the values of specific states and actions to encourage more\nexploration in uncovered pages without platform dependency. The state embedding\nsimilarity is used to calculate the rewards of each exploration step.

It is an important research topic with a wide range of\napplications in computer vision. Label distribution learning (LDL) based\nmethods have been recently proposed for facial pose estimation, which achieve\npromising results.

Second, fixed distribution parameters are applied for all\nlearning samples, severely limiting the model capability.

It is known\nthat user activeness, i.e., number of behaviors, tends to follow a long-tail\ndistribution, where the majority of users are with low activeness. In practice,\nwe observe that tail users suffer from significantly lower-quality\nrecommendation than the head users after joint training. We further identify\nthat a model trained on tail users separately still achieve inferior results\ndue to limited data. Though long-tail distributions are ubiquitous in\nrecommendation systems, improving the recommendation performance on the tail\nusers still remains challenge in both research and industry. Directly applying\nrelated methods on long-tail distribution might be at risk of hurting the\nexperience of head users, which is less affordable since a small portion of\nhead users with high activeness contribute a considerate portion of platform\nrevenue. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that significantly improves\nthe recommendation performance of the tail users while achieving at least\ncomparable performance for the head users over the base model. The essence of\nthis approach is a novel Gradient Aggregation technique that learns common\nknowledge shared by all users into a backbone model, followed by separate\nplugin prediction networks for the head users and the tail users\npersonalization.

    "title": "An Optimal Energy Efficient Design of Artificial Noise for Preventing  Power Leakage based Side-Channel Attacks",
    "abstract": "Side-channel attacks (SCAs), which infer secret information (for example\nsecret keys) by exploiting information that leaks from the implementation (such\nas power consumption), have been shown to be a non-negligible threat to modern\ncryptographic implementations and devices in recent years. Hence, how to\nprevent side-channel attacks on cryptographic devices has become an important\nproblem. One of the widely used countermeasures to against power SCAs is the\ninjection of random noise sequences into the raw leakage traces. However, the\nindiscriminate injection of random noise can lead to significant increases in\nenergy consumption in device, and ways must be found to reduce the amount of\nenergy in noise generation while keeping the side-channel invisible. In this\npaper, we propose an optimal energy-efficient design for artificial noise\ngeneration to prevent side-channel attacks. This approach exploits the sparsity\namong the leakage traces. We model the side-channel as a communication channel,\nwhich allows us to use channel capacity to measure the mutual information\nbetween the secret and the leakage traces. For a given energy budget in the\nnoise generation, we obtain the optimal design of the artificial noise\ninjection by solving the side-channel's channel capacity minimization problem.\nThe experimental results also validate the effectiveness of our proposed\nscheme.",

    "title": "Vector Quantized Diffusion Model with CodeUnet for Text-to-Sign Pose  Sequences Generation",
    "abstract": "Sign Language Production (SLP) aims to translate spoken languages into sign\nsequences automatically. The core process of SLP is to transform sign gloss\nsequences into their corresponding sign pose sequences (G2P). Most existing G2P\nmodels usually perform this conditional long-range generation in an\nautoregressive manner, which inevitably leads to an accumulation of errors. To\naddress this issue, we propose a vector quantized diffusion method for\nconditional pose sequences generation, called PoseVQ-Diffusion, which is an\niterative non-autoregressive method. Specifically, we first introduce a vector\nquantized variational autoencoder (Pose-VQVAE) model to represent a pose\nsequence as a sequence of latent codes. Then we model the latent discrete space\nby an extension of the recently developed diffusion architecture. To better\nleverage the spatial-temporal information, we introduce a novel architecture,\nnamely CodeUnet, to generate higher quality pose sequence in the discrete\nspace. Moreover, taking advantage of the learned codes, we develop a novel\nsequential k-nearest-neighbours method to predict the variable lengths of pose\nsequences for corresponding gloss sequences. Consequently, compared with the\nautoregressive G2P models, our model has a faster sampling speed and produces\nsignificantly better results. Compared with previous non-autoregressive G2P\nmethods, PoseVQ-Diffusion improves the predicted results with iterative\nrefinements, thus achieving state-of-the-art results on the SLP evaluation\nbenchmark.",

Existing meta-learning frameworks typically rely on the\nbody-level representations in spatial dimension, which limits the\ngeneralisation to capture subtle visual differences in the fine-grained label\nspace. To overcome the above limitation, we propose a part-aware prototypical\nrepresentation for one-shot skeleton-based action recognition. Our method\ncaptures skeleton motion patterns at two distinctive spatial levels, one for\nglobal contexts among all body joints, referred to as body level, and the other\nattends to local spatial regions of body parts, referred to as the part level.\nWe also devise a class-agnostic attention mechanism to highlight important\nparts for each action class. Specifically, we develop a part-aware prototypical\ngraph network consisting of three modules: a cascaded embedding module for our\ndual-level modelling, an attention-based part fusion module to fuse parts and\ngenerate part-aware prototypes, and a matching module to perform classification\nwith the part-aware representations.

As the size of real-world graphs continues to scale, the GNN\ntraining system faces a scalability challenge. Distributed training is a\npopular approach to address this challenge by scaling out CPU nodes. However,\nnot much attention has been paid to disk-based GNN training, which can scale up\nthe single-node system in a more cost-effective manner by leveraging\nhigh-performance storage devices like NVMe SSDs. We observe that the data\nmovement between the main memory and the disk is the primary bottleneck in the\nSSD-based training system, and that the conventional GNN training pipeline is\nsub-optimal without taking this overhead into account. Thus, we propose Ginex,\nthe first SSD-based GNN training system that can process billion-scale graph\ndatasets on a single machine. Inspired by the inspector-executor execution\nmodel in compiler optimization, Ginex restructures the GNN training pipeline by\nseparating sample and gather stages. This separation enables Ginex to realize a\nprovably optimal replacement algorithm, known as Belady's algorithm, for\ncaching feature vectors in memory, which account for the dominant portion of\nI/O accesses. According to our evaluation with four billion-scale graph\ndatasets, Ginex achieves 2.11x higher training throughput on average (up to\n2.67x at maximum) than the SSD-extended PyTorch Geometric.",

In many practical usages, there is no reliable information or labels\nover the vertices or edges, leaving structural similarity as the only\ninformation available to match such a graph. In such cases, one often assumes a\nsmall amount of already aligned vertices -- called a seed. Current\nstate-of-the-art scalable seeded alignment algorithms are based on percolation.\nNamely, aligned vertices are used to align their neighbors and gradually\npercolate in parallel in both graphs.

In\ncontrast, multi-frame depth estimation methods improve the depth accuracy\nthanks to the success of Multi-View Stereo (MVS), which directly makes use of\ngeometric constraints. Unfortunately, MVS often suffers from texture-less\nregions, non-Lambertian surfaces, and moving objects, especially in real-world\nvideo sequences without known camera motion and depth supervision.

Unlike existing methods that enforce\nconsistency between MVS depth and monocular depth, MOVEDepth boosts multi-frame\ndepth learning by directly addressing the inherent problems of MVS. The key of\nour approach is to utilize monocular depth as a geometric priority to construct\nMVS cost volume, and adjust depth candidates of cost volume under the guidance\nof predicted camera velocity. We further fuse monocular depth and MVS depth by\nlearning uncertainty in the cost volume, which results in a robust depth\nestimation against ambiguity in multi-view geometry.

For example, online gaming platforms often\nhost friendship-enhancing events in which a user (called the source) only\ninvites his/her friend (called the target) to play together. In this scenario,\nthe measure of friendship closeness is the backbone for understanding source\ninvitation and target adoption behaviors, and underpins the recommendation of\npromising targets for the sources. However, most existing measures for\nfriendship closeness only consider the information between the source and\ntarget but ignore the information of groups where they are located, which\nrenders inferior results. To address this issue, we present new measures for\nfriendship closeness based on the social identity theory (SIT), which describes\nthe inclination that a target endorses behaviors of users inside the same\ngroup. The core of SIT is the process that a target assesses groups of users as\nthem or us. Unfortunately, this process is difficult to be captured due to\nperceptual factors. To this end, we seamlessly reify the factors of SIT into\nquantitative measures, which consider local and global information of a\ntarget's group. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness\nof our proposal against 8 state-of-the-art methods on 3 online gaming datasets.\nIn particular, we demonstrate that our solution can outperform the best\ncompetitor on the behavior prediction (resp. online target recommendation) by\nup to 23.2% (resp. 34.2%) in the corresponding evaluation metric.",

We find that the\nrepresentations for low-resource languages can be easily and greatly improved\nby focusing on just the keywords.

Third, we propose to leverage different levels of\ndomain-related corpora and additional masking of data in the pre-training for\nthe cross-domain adaptation, and discover that more challenging pre-training\ncan better address the domain discrepancy issue in the task knowledge transfer.\nFinally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework, Coach, and a cross-lingual\nand cross-domain parsing framework, X2Parser.

In the case of an image, it is converted into a feature map through\nCNN, and each feature map's pixel is considered a token. At the same time, the\nimage is divided into patch areas and then fused with the transformer method\nthat views them as tokens. For the fusion of tokens with two different\ncharacteristics, we propose three methods: (1) late token fusion with parallel\nstructure, (2) early token fusion, (3) token fusion in a layer by layer. In an\nexperiment using ImageNet 1k, the proposed method shows the best classification\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Optional type annotations allow for enriching dynamic programming languages\nwith static typing features like better Integrated Development Environment\n(IDE) support, more precise program analysis, and early detection and\nprevention of type-related runtime errors. Machine learning-based type\ninference promises interesting results for automating this task. However, the\npractical usage of such systems depends on their ability to generalize across\ndifferent domains, as they are often applied outside their training domain. In\nthis work, we investigate the generalization ability of Type4Py as a\nrepresentative for state-of-the-art deep learning-based type inference systems,\nby conducting extensive cross-domain experiments. Thereby, we address the\nfollowing problems: dataset shifts, out-of-vocabulary words, unknown classes,\nand rare classes. To perform such experiments, we use the datasets ManyTypes4Py\nand CrossDomainTypes4Py. The latter we introduce in this paper. Our dataset has\nover 1,000,000 type annotations and enables cross-domain evaluation of type\ninference systems in different domains of software projects using data from the\ntwo domains web development and scientific calculation. Through our\nexperiments, we detect shifts in the dataset and that it has a long-tailed\ndistribution with many rare and unknown data types which decreases the\nperformance of the deep learning-based type inference system drastically. In\nthis context, we test unsupervised domain adaptation methods and fine-tuning to\novercome the issues. Moreover, we investigate the impact of out-of-vocabulary\nwords.",

HPC systems are ideal platforms to run these studies,\nhowever, reaching the necessary simulation timescale to detect rare processes\nis challenging, even with modern supercomputers. To overcome the timescale\nlimitation, the simulation of a long MD trajectory is replaced by multiple\nshort-range simulations that are executed simultaneously in an ensemble of\nsimulations.

Test-time\ntraining has previously been shown to reduce generalization error for image\nclassification, domain adaptation, semantic segmentation, and zero-shot\nsketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR). In UCDR, in addition to the semantic\nshift of unknown categories present in ZS-SBIR, the presence of unknown domains\nleads to even higher distribution shifts. To bridge this domain gap, we use\nself-supervision through 3 different losses - Barlow Twins, Jigsaw Puzzle and\nRotNet on a pretrained network at test-time.

Each\nclient is associated with a multi-armed bandit in which each arm yields {\\em\ni.i.d.}\\ rewards following a Gaussian distribution with an unknown mean and\nknown variance. The set of arms is assumed to be the same at all the clients.\nWe define two notions of best arm -- local and global.

    "abstract": "Multi-person motion prediction remains a challenging problem, especially in\nthe joint representation learning of individual motion and social interactions.\nMost prior methods only involve learning local pose dynamics for individual\nmotion (without global body trajectory) and also struggle to capture complex\ninteraction dependencies for social interactions. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Social-Aware Motion Transformer (SoMoFormer) to effectively model\nindividual motion and social interactions in a joint manner. Specifically,\nSoMoFormer extracts motion features from sub-sequences in displacement\ntrajectory space to effectively learn both local and global pose dynamics for\neach individual. In addition, we devise a novel social-aware motion attention\nmechanism in SoMoFormer to further optimize dynamics representations and\ncapture interaction dependencies simultaneously via motion similarity\ncalculation across time and social dimensions. On both short- and long-term\nhorizons, we empirically evaluate our framework on multi-person motion datasets\nand demonstrate that our method greatly outperforms state-of-the-art methods of\nsingle- and multi-person motion prediction.

We detail the choices that can be made for\nthe FP8 format, including the important choice of the number of bits for the\nmantissa and exponent, and show analytically in which settings these choices\ngive better performance. Then we show how these findings translate to real\nnetworks, provide an efficient implementation for FP8 simulation, and a new\nalgorithm that enables the learning of both the scale parameters and the number\nof exponent bits in the FP8 format. Our chief conclusion is that when doing\npost-training quantization for a wide range of networks, the FP8 format is\nbetter than INT8 in terms of accuracy, and the choice of the number of exponent\nbits is driven by the severity of outliers in the network.

In\npractice, however, this is not always the case. This poses a great problem for\nscene text detection for which a consistent spatial response is crucial,\nirrespective of the position of the text in the scene.\nUsing a simple synthetic experiment, we demonstrate the inherent shift\nvariance of a state-of-the-art fully convolutional text detector.

To quantify the amount of shift variability, we\npropose a metric based on well-established text detection benchmarks.\nWhile the proposed architectural changes are not able to fully recover shift\nequivariance, adding smoothing filters can substantially improve shift\nconsistency on common text datasets.

    "abstract": "A potential vulnerability for integrated circuits (ICs) is the insertion of\nhardware trojans (HTs) during manufacturing. Understanding the practicability\nof such an attack can lead to appropriate measures for mitigating it. In this\npaper, we demonstrate a pragmatic framework for analyzing HT susceptibility of\nfinalized layouts. Our framework is representative of a fabrication-time\nattack, where the adversary is assumed to have access only to a layout\nrepresentation of the circuit. The framework inserts trojans into tapeout-ready\nlayouts utilizing an Engineering Change Order (ECO) flow. The attacked security\nnodes are blindly searched utilizing reverse-engineering techniques. For our\nexperimental investigation, we utilized three crypto-cores (AES-128, SHA-256,\nand RSA) and a microcontroller (RISC-V) as targets. We explored 96 combinations\nof triggers, payloads and targets for our framework. Our findings demonstrate\nthat even in high-density designs, the covert insertion of sophisticated\ntrojans is possible. All this while maintaining the original target logic, with\nminimal impact on power and performance. Furthermore, from our exploration, we\nconclude that it is too naive to only utilize placement resources as a metric\nfor HT vulnerability. This work highlights that the HT insertion success is a\ncomplex function of the placement, routing resources, the position of the\nattacked nodes, and further design-specific characteristics. As a result, our\nframework goes beyond just an attack, we present the most advanced analysis\ntool to assess the vulnerability of HT insertion into finalized layouts.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning driven joint source-channel coding (JSCC) for wireless image or\nvideo transmission, also called DeepJSCC, has been a topic of interest recently\nwith very promising results. The idea is to map similar source samples to\nnearby points in the channel input space such that, despite the noise\nintroduced by the channel, the input can be recovered with minimal distortion.\nIn DeepJSCC, this is achieved by an autoencoder architecture with a\nnon-trainable channel layer between the encoder and decoder. DeepJSCC has many\nfavorable properties, such as better end-to-end distortion performance than its\nseparate source and channel coding counterpart as well as graceful degradation\nwith respect to channel quality. However, due to the inherent correlation\nbetween the source sample and channel input, DeepJSCC is vulnerable to\neavesdropping attacks. In this paper, we propose the first DeepJSCC scheme for\nwireless image transmission that is secure against eavesdroppers, called\nDeepJSCEC. DeepJSCEC not only preserves the favorable properties of DeepJSCC,\nit also provides security against chosen-plaintext attacks from the\neavesdropper, without the need to make assumptions about the eavesdropper's\nchannel condition, or its intended use of the intercepted signal. Numerical\nresults show that DeepJSCEC achieves similar or better image quality than\nseparate source coding using BPG compression, AES encryption, and LDPC codes\nfor channel coding, while preserving the graceful degradation of image quality\nwith respect to channel quality. We also show that the proposed encryption\nmethod is problem agnostic, meaning it can be applied to other end-to-end JSCC\nproblems, such as remote classification, without modification. Given the\nimportance of security in modern wireless communication systems, we believe\nthis work brings DeepJSCC schemes much closer to adoption in practice.",

This model\nprovides an elegant abstraction for many real-world problems in domains such as\neducation and employment, where decisions about the distribution of\nopportunities can affect the future capabilities of communities and the\ndisparity between them. A decision-maker in such settings must consider the\nimpact of her decisions on future rewards in addition to the standard objective\nof maximizing her cumulative reward at any time. In many of these applications,\nthe time horizon is unknown to the decision-maker beforehand, which motivates\nthe study of the IMAB problem in the technically more challenging\nhorizon-unaware setting. We study the tension that arises between two seemingly\nconflicting objectives in the horizon-unaware setting: a) maximizing the\ncumulative reward at any time based on current rewards of the arms, and b)\nensuring that arms with better long-term rewards get sufficient opportunities\neven if they initially have low rewards. We show that, surprisingly, the two\nobjectives are aligned with each other in this setting. Our main contribution\nis an anytime algorithm for the IMAB problem that achieves the best possible\ncumulative reward while ensuring that the arms reach their true potential given\nsufficient time. Our algorithm mitigates the initial disparity due to lack of\nopportunity and continues pulling an arm till it stops improving.

Adversarial\nattacks threaten the robustness of neural network classifiers, causing them to\nconsistently and confidently misidentify road signs. One such class of attack,\nshadow-based attacks, causes misidentifications by applying a natural-looking\nshadow to input images, resulting in road signs that appear natural to a human\nobserver but confusing for these classifiers. Current defenses against such\nattacks use a simple adversarial training procedure to achieve a rather low\n25\\% and 40\\% robustness on the GTSRB and LISA test sets, respectively. In this\npaper, we propose a robust, fast, and generalizable method, designed to defend\nagainst shadow attacks in the context of road sign recognition, that augments\nsource images with binary adaptive threshold and edge maps. We empirically show\nits robustness against shadow attacks, and reformulate the problem to show its\nsimilarity $\\varepsilon$ perturbation-based attacks.

In the latter case, the\ncombination of large distances and demanded number flights is such that a\nsystem with centralized control, with most of the decisions made by human\noperators, is safe. However, for AAM, it is expected a much higher demand,\nbecause it will be used for people's daily commutes. Thus, higher automation\nlevels will become a requirement for coordinating this traffic, which might not\nbe effectively managed by humans. The establishment of fixed air routes can\nabate complexity, however at the cost of limiting capacity and decreasing\nefficiency. Another alternative is the use of a powerful central system based\non Artificial Intelligence (AI), which would allow flexible trajectories and\nhigher efficiency.

This technology\nenables distributed airspace allocation management and conflict resolution by\nmeans of trusted shared data structures and associated smart contracts running\non a blockchain ecosystem.

In this paper,\nwe introduce SQuARE v2, the new version of SQuARE, to provide an explainability\ninfrastructure for comparing models based on methods such as saliency maps and\ngraph-based explanations. While saliency maps are useful to inspect the\nimportance of each input token for the model's prediction, graph-based\nexplanations from external Knowledge Graphs enable the users to verify the\nreasoning behind the model prediction. In addition, we provide multiple\nadversarial attacks to compare the robustness of QA models. With these\nexplainability methods and adversarial attacks, we aim to ease the research on\ntrustworthy QA models. SQuARE is available on https://square.ukp-lab.de.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has gained a lot of success with the presence of\ntrust region policy optimization (TRPO) and proximal policy optimization (PPO),\nfor their scalability and efficiency. However, the pessimism of both\nalgorithms, among which it either is constrained in a trust region or strictly\nexcludes all suspicious gradients, has been proven to suppress the exploration\nand harm the performance of the agent. To address those issues, we propose a\nshifted Markov decision process (MDP), or rather, with entropy augmentation, to\nencourage the exploration and reinforce the ability of escaping from\nsuboptimums. Our method is extensible and adapts to either reward shaping or\nbootstrapping. With convergence analysis given, we find it is crucial to\ncontrol the temperature coefficient. However, if appropriately tuning it, we\ncan achieve remarkable performance, even on other algorithms, since it is\nsimple yet effective. Our experiments test augmented TRPO and PPO on MuJoCo\nbenchmark tasks, of an indication that the agent is heartened towards higher\nreward regions, and enjoys a balance between exploration and exploitation. We\nverify the exploration bonus of our method on two grid world environments.",

    "abstract": "For many years, exact metric search relied upon the property of triangle\ninequality to give a lower bound on uncalculated distances. Two exclusion\nmechanisms derive from this property, generally known as pivot exclusion and\nhyperplane exclusion. These mechanisms work in any proper metric space and are\nthe basis of many metric indexing mechanisms. More recently, the Ptolemaic and\nfour-point lower bound properties have been shown to give tighter bounds in\nsome subclasses of metric space.\nBoth triangle inequality and the four-point lower bound directly imply\nstraightforward partitioning mechanisms: that is, a method of dividing a finite\nspace according to a fixed partition, in order that one or more classes of the\npartition can be eliminated from a search at query time. However, up to now, no\npartitioning principle has been identified for the Ptolemaic inequality, which\nhas been used only as a filtering mechanism.\nHere, a novel partitioning mechanism for the Ptolemaic lower bound is\npresented. It is always better than either pivot or hyperplane partitioning.\nWhile the exclusion condition itself is weaker than Hilbert (four-point)\nexclusion, its calculation is cheaper. Furthermore, it can be combined with\nHilbert exclusion to give a new maximum for exclusion power with respect to the\nnumber of distances measured per query.",

The\nnew trigger is a uniformly randomly generated three-dimensional (3D) binary\npattern that can be horizontally and/or vertically repeated and mirrored and\nsuperposed onto three-channel images for training a backdoored DNN model.\nDispersed throughout an image, the new trigger produces weak perturbation to\nindividual pixels, but collectively holds a strong recognizable pattern to\ntrain and activate the backdoor of the DNN.

Consequently, in software\nengineering industry, the Global Software Development (GSD) is the most widely\nconsidering software development paradigm as it offers significant strategic\nand business gains. Seeking the benefits of GSD, the European software\nengineering organizations are outsourcing their development activities in\ndeveloping countries. Considering the criticalities of agile adoption in GSD,\nthis work empirically studies the motivators that could positively influence\nthe execution of agile-based GSD in European software industry. A quantitative\nsurvey was conducted and data from 139 practitioners working in agile and GSD\nbased projects was collected. The collected observations were further analyzed\nusing Smart-PLS (3.0). The results show that the identified motivators are\nimportant to consider by industry experts to successfully apply the agile\npractices in GSD context.",

This paper studies the problem of optimally\nforming platoons when considering realistic HoS regulations. In our problem,\ntrucks have fixed routes in a transportation network and can wait at hubs along\ntheir routes to form platoons with others while fulfilling the driving and rest\ntime constraints. We propose a distributed decision-making scheme where each\ntruck controls its waiting times at hubs based on the predicted schedules of\nothers. The decoupling of trucks' decision-makings contributes to an\napproximate dynamic programming approach for platoon coordination under HoS\nregulations. Finally, we perform a simulation over the Swedish road network\nwith one thousand trucks to evaluate the achieved platooning benefits under the\nHoS regulations in the European Union (EU). The simulation results show that,\non average, trucks drive in platoons for 37% of their routes if each truck is\nallowed to be delayed for 5% of its total travel time. If trucks are not\nallowed to be delayed, they drive in platoons for 12% of their routes.",

    "abstract": "Interpretability of Deep Learning (DL) models is arguably the barrier in\nfront of trustworthy AI. Despite great efforts made by the Explainable AI (XAI)\ncommunity, explanations lack robustness--indistinguishable input perturbations\nmay lead to different XAI results. Thus, it is vital to assess how robust DL\ninterpretability is, given an XAI technique. To this end, we identify the\nfollowing challenges that state-of-the-art is unable to cope with collectively:\ni) XAI techniques are highly heterogeneous; ii) misinterpretations are normally\nrare events; iii) both worst-case and overall robustness are of practical\ninterest. In this paper, we propose two evaluation methods to tackle them--i)\nthey are of black-box nature, based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Subset\nSimulation (SS); ii) bespoke fitness functions are used by GA to solve a\nconstrained optimisation efficiently, while SS is dedicated to estimating rare\nevent probabilities; iii) two diverse metrics are introduced, concerning the\nworst-case interpretation discrepancy and a probabilistic notion of\n\\textit{how} robust in general, respectively. We conduct experiments to study\nthe accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency of our methods that outperform\nstate-of-the-arts. Finally, we show two applications of our methods for ranking\nrobust XAI methods and selecting training schemes to improve both\nclassification and interpretation robustness.",

    "abstract": "The line coverage problem is to find efficient routes for coverage of linear\nfeatures by one or more resource-constrained robots. Linear features model\nenvironments such as road networks, power lines, and oil and gas pipelines. We\ndefine two modes of travel for the robots: servicing and deadheading. A robot\nservices a feature if it performs task-specific actions, e.g., taking images,\nas it traverses the feature; otherwise, it is deadheading. Traversing the\nenvironment incurs costs (e.g., travel time) and demands on resources (e.g.,\nbattery life). Servicing and deadheading can have different cost and demand\nfunctions, and we further permit them to be direction-dependent. We model the\nenvironment as a graph and provide an integer linear program. As the problem is\nNP-hard, we develop a fast and efficient heuristic algorithm, Merge-Embed-Merge\n(MEM). The constructive property of the algorithm enables solving the\nmulti-depot version for large graphs. We further extend the MEM algorithm to\nhandle turning costs and nonholonomic constraints. We benchmark the algorithm\non a dataset of 50 road networks and demonstrate the algorithm in experiments\nusing aerial robots on road networks.",

In this paper,\nwe propose a novel hierarchical compositional representations (HCR) learning\napproach for few-shot action recognition.

Although there exist large differences\nbetween base classes and novel classes, they can share similar patterns in\nsub-actions or SAS-actions. Furthermore, we adopt the Earth Mover's Distance in\nthe transportation problem to measure the similarity between video samples in\nterms of sub-action representations.

    "abstract": "Multi-task learning of dense prediction tasks, by sharing both the encoder\nand decoder, as opposed to sharing only the encoder, provides an attractive\nfront to increase both accuracy and computational efficiency. When the tasks\nare similar, sharing the decoder serves as an additional inductive bias\nproviding more room for tasks to share complementary information among\nthemselves. However, increased sharing exposes more parameters to task\ninterference which likely hinders both generalization and robustness. Effective\nways to curb this interference while exploiting the inductive bias of sharing\nthe decoder remains an open challenge. To address this challenge, we propose\nProgressive Decoder Fusion (PDF) to progressively combine task decoders based\non inter-task representation similarity. We show that this procedure leads to a\nmulti-task network with better generalization to in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution data and improved robustness to adversarial attacks.\nAdditionally, we observe that the predictions of different tasks of this\nmulti-task network are more consistent with each other.",

We test the\nproposed method on two different benchmark problems, including a new simplified\nproblem that retains all the characteristics of a heart cycle.

In this work, we initiate the study of LCL\nproblems in the low-space Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model.

Moreover, the most important technical feature\nof our algorithms is that they use optimal global memory, that is, memory\nlinear in the number of edges of the graph. In contrast, most of the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms use more than linear global memory. Further, they\ntypically start with a dense graph, sparsify it, and then solve the problem on\nthe residual graph, exploiting the relative increase in global memory.

    "title": "A Physics-based Domain Adaptation framework for modelling and  forecasting building energy systems",
    "abstract": "State-of-the-art machine-learning based models are a popular choice for\nmodelling and forecasting energy behaviour in buildings because given enough\ndata, they are good at finding spatiotemporal patterns and structures even in\nscenarios where the complexity prohibits analytical descriptions. However,\nmachine-learning based models for building energy forecasting have difficulty\ngeneralizing to out-of-sample scenarios that are not represented in the data\nbecause their architecture typically does not hold physical correspondence to\nmechanistic structures linked with governing phenomena of energy transfer.\nThus, their ability to forecast for unseen initial conditions and boundary\nconditions wholly depends on the representativeness in the data, which is not\nguaranteed in building measurement data. Consequently, these limitations impede\ntheir application to real-world engineering applications such as energy\nmanagement in Digital Twins. In response, we present a Domain Adaptation\nframework that aims to leverage well-known understanding of phenomenon\ngoverning energy behavior in buildings to forecast for out of sample scenarios\nbeyond building measurement data. More specifically, we represent mechanistic\nknowledge of energy behavior using low-rank linear time-invariant state space\nmodels and subsequently leverage their governing structure to forecast for a\ntarget energy system for which only building measurement data is available. We\nachieve this by aligning the Physics-derived subspace that governs global state\nspace behavior closer towards the target subspace derived from the measurement\ndata. In this initial exploration we focus on linear energy systems; we test\nthe subspace-based DA framework on a 1D heat conduction scenario by varying the\nthermophysical properties of the source and target systems to demonstrate the\ntransferability of mechanistic models from Physics to measurement data.",

    "abstract": "The challenge of graphically rendering high frame-rate videos on low compute\ndevices can be addressed through periodic prediction of future frames to\nenhance the user experience in virtual reality applications. This is studied\nthrough the problem of temporal view synthesis (TVS), where the goal is to\npredict the next frames of a video given the previous frames and the head poses\nof the previous and the next frames. In this work, we consider the TVS of\ndynamic scenes in which both the user and objects are moving. We design a\nframework that decouples the motion into user and object motion to effectively\nuse the available user motion while predicting the next frames. We predict the\nmotion of objects by isolating and estimating the 3D object motion in the past\nframes and then extrapolating it. We employ multi-plane images (MPI) as a 3D\nrepresentation of the scenes and model the object motion as the 3D displacement\nbetween the corresponding points in the MPI representation. In order to handle\nthe sparsity in MPIs while estimating the motion, we incorporate partial\nconvolutions and masked correlation layers to estimate corresponding points.\nThe predicted object motion is then integrated with the given user or camera\nmotion to generate the next frame. Using a disocclusion infilling module, we\nsynthesize the regions uncovered due to the camera and object motion.

    "abstract": "Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) systems perform a sequence-to-sequence\ntask, where an input word sequence containing grammatical errors, is corrected\nfor these errors by the GEC system to output a grammatically correct word\nsequence. With the advent of deep learning methods, automated GEC systems have\nbecome increasingly popular. For example, GEC systems are often used on speech\ntranscriptions of English learners as a form of assessment and feedback - these\npowerful GEC systems can be used to automatically measure an aspect of a\ncandidate's fluency. The count of \\textit{edits} from a candidate's input\nsentence (or essay) to a GEC system's grammatically corrected output sentence\nis indicative of a candidate's language ability, where fewer edits suggest\nbetter fluency. The count of edits can thus be viewed as a \\textit{fluency\nscore} with zero implying perfect fluency. However, although deep learning\nbased GEC systems are extremely powerful and accurate, they are susceptible to\nadversarial attacks: an adversary can introduce a small, specific change at the\ninput of a system that causes a large, undesired change at the output. When\nconsidering the application of GEC systems to automated language assessment,\nthe aim of an adversary could be to cheat by making a small change to a\ngrammatically incorrect input sentence that conceals the errors from a GEC\nsystem, such that no edits are found and the candidate is unjustly awarded a\nperfect fluency score. This work examines a simple universal substitution\nadversarial attack that non-native speakers of English could realistically\nemploy to deceive GEC systems used for assessment.",

A quantity of interest estimated from an ELM has no guarantee to be the\nsame as the solution of the original nonlinear system. In this study, we tackle\nthis fundamental limitation. We sequentially address the following two\nquestions: i) given an equivalent linear system obtained from any ELM, how do\nwe construct an estimator so that, as the linear system simulations are guided\nby a limited number of nonlinear system simulations, the estimator converges on\nthe nonlinear system solution? ii) how to construct an optimized equivalent\nlinear system such that the estimator approaches the nonlinear system solution\nas quickly as possible?

We\nadapt the well-known Monte Carlo theories into the specific context of\nequivalent linearization. The second question is challenging, especially when\nrare event probabilities are of interest.

    "abstract": "Discovering the underlying dynamics of complex systems from data is an\nimportant practical topic. Constrained optimization algorithms are widely\nutilized and lead to many successes. Yet, such purely data-driven methods may\nbring about incorrect physics in the presence of random noise and cannot easily\nhandle the situation with incomplete data. In this paper, a new iterative\nlearning algorithm for complex turbulent systems with partial observations is\ndeveloped that alternates between identifying model structures, recovering\nunobserved variables, and estimating parameters. First, a causality-based\nlearning approach is utilized for the sparse identification of model\nstructures, which takes into account certain physics knowledge that is\npre-learned from data. It has unique advantages in coping with indirect\ncoupling between features and is robust to the stochastic noise. A practical\nalgorithm is designed to facilitate the causal inference for high-dimensional\nsystems. Next, a systematic nonlinear stochastic parameterization is built to\ncharacterize the time evolution of the unobserved variables. Closed analytic\nformula via an efficient nonlinear data assimilation is exploited to sample the\ntrajectories of the unobserved variables, which are then treated as synthetic\nobservations to advance a rapid parameter estimation. Furthermore, the\nlocalization of the state variable dependence and the physics constraints are\nincorporated into the learning procedure, which mitigate the curse of\ndimensionality and prevent the finite time blow-up issue. Numerical experiments\nshow that the new algorithm succeeds in identifying the model structure and\nproviding suitable stochastic parameterizations for many complex nonlinear\nsystems with chaotic dynamics, spatiotemporal multiscale structures,\nintermittency, and extreme events.",

Constantly improving access to new satellite data sources as\nwell as big data processing capabilities has unlocked an unprecedented number\nof possibilities in terms of data-driven solutions to this problem.\nSpecifically, the fusion of data from satellites, such as the Copernicus\nSentinels, which have high spatial and low temporal resolution, with data from\nNASA SMAP and GPM missions, which have low spatial but high temporal\nresolutions could yield high-resolution flood inundation at a daily scale.

Despite its practical interest, there is limited formal\nguidance on how to select metrics for machine learning applications. This\nthesis outlines metric elicitation as a principled framework for selecting the\nperformance metric that best reflects implicit user preferences. Once\nspecified, the evaluation metric can be used to compare and train models. In\nthis manuscript, we formalize the problem of Metric Elicitation and devise\nnovel strategies for eliciting classification performance metrics using\npairwise preference feedback over classifiers. Specifically, we provide novel\nstrategies for eliciting linear and linear-fractional metrics for binary and\nmulticlass classification problems, which are then extended to a framework that\nelicits group-fair performance metrics in the presence of multiple sensitive\ngroups. All the elicitation strategies that we discuss are robust to both\nfinite sample and feedback noise, thus are useful in practice for real-world\napplications. Using the tools and the geometric characterizations of the\nfeasible confusion statistics sets from the binary, multiclass, and\nmulticlass-multigroup classification setups, we further provide strategies to\nelicit from a wider range of complex, modern multiclass metrics defined by\nquadratic functions of confusion statistics by exploiting their local linear\nstructure. From application perspective, we also propose to use the metric\nelicitation framework in optimizing complex black box metrics that is amenable\nto deep network training. Lastly, to bring theory closer to practice, we\nconduct a preliminary real-user study that shows the efficacy of the metric\nelicitation framework in recovering the users' preferred performance metric in\na binary classification setup.",

By comparing this space with the\ncharacteristics of storage technologies currently under development (e.g.,\npumped thermal energy storage, compressed air energy storage, etc.), we learn\nthat significant improvements are needed for them to become part of the optimal\nsolutions. Reducing energy capacity cost, increasing discharge efficiency, and\nreducing the cost of charging power capacity must be prioritized. As other\nsectors are electrified, the design space for storage-X shows similar\ncharacteristics. We find a potential system cost reduction of 10% with the best\nstorage configuration. But for this to be realized, the storage is required to\nprovide a high load coverage. Even in that case, renewable curtailment of 1% is\nstill present in the optimal system.",

    "abstract": "We propose formulating the finite-horizon stochastic optimal control problem\nfor colloidal self-assembly in the space of probability density functions\n(PDFs) of the underlying state variables (namely, order parameters). The\ncontrol objective is formulated in terms of steering the state PDFs from a\nprescribed initial probability measure towards a prescribed terminal\nprobability measure with minimum control effort. For specificity, we use a\nunivariate stochastic state model from the literature. Both the analysis and\nthe computational steps for control synthesis as developed in this paper\ngeneralize for multivariate stochastic state dynamics given by generic\nnonlinear in state and non-affine in control models. We derive the conditions\nof optimality for the associated optimal control problem. This derivation\nyields a system of three coupled partial differential equations together with\nthe boundary conditions at the initial and terminal times. The resulting system\nis a generalized instance of the so-called Schr\\\"{o}dinger bridge problem. We\nthen determine the optimal control policy by training a physics-informed deep\nneural network, where the \"physics\" are the derived conditions of optimality.\nThe performance of the proposed solution is demonstrated via numerical\nsimulations on a benchmark colloidal self-assembly problem.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The localisation and segmentation of individual bones is an\nimportant preprocessing step in many planning and navigation applications. It\nis, however, a time-consuming and repetitive task if done manually. This is\ntrue not only for clinical practice but also for the acquisition of training\ndata. We therefore not only present an end-to-end learnt algorithm that is\ncapable of segmenting 125 distinct bones in an upper-body CT, but also provide\nan ensemble-based uncertainty measure that helps to single out scans to enlarge\nthe training dataset with. Methods We create fully automated end-to-end learnt\nsegmentations using a neural network architecture inspired by the 3D-Unet and\nfully supervised training. The results are improved using ensembles and\ninference-time augmentation. We examine the relationship of\nensemble-uncertainty to an unlabelled scan's prospective usefulness as part of\nthe training dataset. Results: Our methods are evaluated on an in-house dataset\nof 16 upper-body CT scans with a resolution of \\SI{2}{\\milli\\meter} per\ndimension. Taking into account all 125 bones in our label set, our most\nsuccessful ensemble achieves a median dice score coefficient of 0.83. We find a\nlack of correlation between a scan's ensemble uncertainty and its prospective\ninfluence on the accuracies achieved within an enlarged training set. At the\nsame time, we show that the ensemble uncertainty correlates to the number of\nvoxels that need manual correction after an initial automated segmentation,\nthus minimising the time required to finalise a new ground truth segmentation.\nConclusion: In combination, scans with low ensemble uncertainty need less\nannotator time while yielding similar future DSC improvements. They are thus\nideal candidates to enlarge a training set for upper-body distinct bone\nsegmentation from CT scans. }",

We aim to develop a new\ndeep learning toolkit to support annotation-efficient learning for medical\nimage segmentation, which can accelerate and simply the development of deep\nlearning models with limited annotation budget, e.g., learning from partial,\nsparse or noisy annotations.\nMethods: Our proposed toolkit named PyMIC is a modular deep learning platform\nfor medical image segmentation tasks. In addition to basic components that\nsupport development of high-performance models for fully supervised\nsegmentation, it contains several advanced components that are tailored for\nlearning from imperfect annotations, such as loading annotated and unannounced\nimages, loss functions for unannotated, partially or inaccurately annotated\nimages, and training procedures for co-learning between multiple networks, etc.\nPyMIC is built on the PyTorch framework and supports development of\nsemi-supervised, weakly supervised and noise-robust learning methods for\nmedical image segmentation.\nResults: We present four illustrative medical image segmentation tasks based\non PyMIC: (1) Achieving competitive performance on fully supervised learning;\n(2) Semi-supervised cardiac structure segmentation with only 10% training\nimages annotated; (3) Weakly supervised segmentation using scribble\nannotations; and (4) Learning from noisy labels for chest radiograph\nsegmentation.\nConclusions: The PyMIC toolkit is easy to use and facilitates efficient\ndevelopment of medical image segmentation models with imperfect annotations.

Optical computing has been\nreawakened as a potential solution to large-scale computing through optical\naccelerators that carry out linear operations while reducing electrical power.\nHowever, to achieve efficient computing with light, creating and controlling\nnonlinearity optically rather than electronically remains a challenge. This\nstudy explores a reservoir computing (RC) approach whereby a 14 mm long\nfew-mode waveguide in LiNbO3 on insulator is used as a complex nonlinear\noptical processor. A dataset is encoded digitally on the spectrum of a\nfemtosecond pulse which is then launched in the waveguide. The output spectrum\ndepends nonlinearly on the input. We experimentally show that a simple digital\nlinear classifier with 784 parameters using the output spectrum from the\nwaveguide as input increased the classification accuracy of several databases\ncompared to non-transformed data, approximately 10$\\%$. In comparison, a deep\ndigital neural network (NN) with 40000 parameters was necessary to achieve the\nsame accuracy.

Although the literature\nhas shown promising efforts in this direction, reported results do not consider\nthe variability of CT scans acquired under varying circumstances, thus\nrendering resulting models unfit for use on data acquired using e.g. different\nscanner technologies. While COVID-19 diagnosis can now be done efficiently\nusing PCR tests, this use case exemplifies the need for a methodology to\novercome data variability issues in order to make medical image analysis models\nmore widely applicable.

Comput.\nFluids, 157, 208-231 (2017).\" The model equation used for this analysis is the\none-dimensional (1D) convection-diffusion equation (CDE) which provides a\nunique state for the Lax-Wendroff method, results of which will have direct\nconsequences for the solution of Navier-Stokes equations. Furthermore, the\nspecific choice of the governing equation enables a direct assessment of the\nperformance of numerical methods for solving fluid flows due to its one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the Navier-Stokes equation as established in \"Effects of\nnumerical anti-diffusion in closed unsteady flows governed by two-dimensional\nNavier-Stokes equation - Suman et al. Comput. Fluids, 201, 104479 (2020)\". The\nlimiting case of the non-uniform compact scheme, which is a uniform grid, is\nconsidered. This is also investigated using GSA, and potential differences for\nthe non-uniformity of grid are compared. Finally, further use of this newly\ndeveloped Lax-Wendroff method for the non-uniformity of grid is quantified for\nits application in DNS and LES.",

    "title": "Undersampling Raster Scans in Spectromicroscopy for reduced dose and  faster measurements",
    "abstract": "Combinations of spectroscopic analysis and microscopic techniques are used\nacross many disciplines of scientific research, including material science,\nchemistry and biology. X-ray spectromicroscopy, in particular, is a powerful\ntool used for studying chemical state distributions at the micro and nano\nscales. With the beam fixed, a specimen is typically rastered through the probe\nwith continuous motion and a range of multimodal data is collected at fixed\ntime intervals.\nThe application of this technique is limited in some areas due to: long\nscanning times to collect the data, either because of the area/volume under\nstudy or the compositional properties of the specimen; and material degradation\ndue to the dose absorbed during the measurement. In this work, we propose a\nnovel approach for reducing the dose and scanning times by undersampling the\nraster data. This is achieved by skipping rows within scans and reconstructing\nthe x-ray spectromicroscopic measurements using low-rank matrix completion. The\nnew method is robust and allows for x 5-6 reduction in sampling. Experimental\nresults obtained on real data are illustrated.",

    "abstract": "Methods of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are used in\ngeoscientific applications to gain insights into the decision-making strategy\nof Neural Networks (NNs) highlighting which features in the input contribute\nthe most to a NN prediction. Here, we discuss our lesson learned that the task\nof attributing a prediction to the input does not have a single solution.\nInstead, the attribution results and their interpretation depend greatly on the\nconsidered baseline (sometimes referred to as reference point) that the XAI\nmethod utilizes; a fact that has been overlooked so far in the literature. This\nbaseline can be chosen by the user or it is set by construction in the method s\nalgorithm, often without the user being aware of that choice. We highlight that\ndifferent baselines can lead to different insights for different science\nquestions and, thus, should be chosen accordingly. To illustrate the impact of\nthe baseline, we use a large ensemble of historical and future climate\nsimulations forced with the SSP3-7.0 scenario and train a fully connected NN to\npredict the ensemble- and global-mean temperature (i.e., the forced global\nwarming signal) given an annual temperature map from an individual ensemble\nmember. We then use various XAI methods and different baselines to attribute\nthe network predictions to the input. We show that attributions differ\nsubstantially when considering different baselines, as they correspond to\nanswering different science questions. We conclude by discussing some important\nimplications and considerations about the use of baselines in XAI research.",
