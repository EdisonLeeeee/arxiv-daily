We propose two algorithms that\nreturn coarse-grained equivalent HMMs obtained by stochastic projection\noperators: the first returns models that reproduce the single-time distribution\nof a given output process, while in the second the full (multi-time)\ndistribution is preserved. The reduction method exploits not only the structure\nof the observed output, but also its initial condition, whenever the latter is\nknown or belongs to a given subclass. Optimal algorithms are derived for a\nclass of HMM, namely observable ones.

    "abstract": "The size of deep learning models in artificial intelligence (AI) software is\nincreasing rapidly, which hinders the large-scale deployment on\nresource-restricted devices (e.g., smartphones). To mitigate this issue, AI\nsoftware compression plays a crucial role, which aims to compress model size\nwhile keeping high performance. However, the intrinsic defects in the big model\nmay be inherited by the compressed one. Such defects may be easily leveraged by\nattackers, since the compressed models are usually deployed in a large number\nof devices without adequate protection. In this paper, we try to address the\nsafe model compression problem from a safety-performance co-optimization\nperspective. Specifically, inspired by the test-driven development (TDD)\nparadigm in software engineering, we propose a test-driven sparse training\nframework called SafeCompress. By simulating the attack mechanism as the safety\ntest, SafeCompress can automatically compress a big model to a small one\nfollowing the dynamic sparse training paradigm. Further, considering a\nrepresentative attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA), we develop a\nconcrete safe model compression mechanism, called MIA-SafeCompress. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted to evaluate MIA-SafeCompress on five datasets for\nboth computer vision and natural language processing tasks. The results verify\nthe effectiveness and generalization of our method. We also discuss how to\nadapt SafeCompress to other attacks besides MIA, demonstrating the flexibility\nof SafeCompress.",

Through an essential set of elementary nonlinear bending test cases,\nthe stresses and moments of each model are examined analytically. Only the\nproposed bending model passes all the test cases while the other bending models\neither fail or only pass the test cases for small deformations. The proposed\nnew bending model can handle large deformations and initially curved surfaces.\nIt is based on the principal curvatures and their directions in the initial\nconfiguration, and it thus can have different bending moduli along those\ndirections. These characteristics make it flexible in modeling a given\nmaterial, while it does not suffer from the pathologies of existing bending\nmodels. Further, the bending models are compared computationally through four\nclassical benchmark examples and one contact example. As the underlying shell\ntheory is based on Kirchhoff-Love kinematics, isogeometric NURBS shape\nfunctions are used to discretize the shell surface.

    "abstract": "The ability to control network dynamics is essential for ensuring desirable\nfunctionality of many technological, biological, and social systems. Such\nsystems often consist of a large number of network elements, and controlling\nlarge-scale networks remains challenging because the computation and\ncommunication requirements increase prohibitively fast with network size. Here,\nwe introduce a notion of network locality that can be exploited to make the\ncontrol of networks scalable even when the dynamics are nonlinear. We show that\nnetwork locality is captured by an information metric and is almost universally\nobserved across real and model networks. In localized networks, the optimal\ncontrol actions and system responses are both shown to be necessarily\nconcentrated in small neighborhoods induced by the information metric. This\nallows us to develop localized algorithms for determining network\ncontrollability and optimizing the placement of driver nodes. This also allows\nus to develop a localized algorithm for designing local feedback controllers\nthat approach the performance of the corresponding best global controllers\nwhile incurring a computational cost orders-of-magnitude lower. We validate the\nlocality, performance, and efficiency of the algorithms in Kuramoto oscillator\nnetworks as well as three large empirical networks: synchronization dynamics in\nthe Eastern U.S. power grid, epidemic spreading mediated by the global air\ntransportation network, and Alzheimer's disease dynamics in a human brain\nnetwork.

    "abstract": "In a wireless sensor network, data from various sensors are gathered to\nestimate the system-state of the process system. However, adversaries aim at\ndistorting the system-state estimate, for which they may infiltrate sensors or\nposition additional devices in the environment. To authenticate the received\nprocess values, the integrity of the measurements from different sensors can be\nevaluated jointly with the temporal integrity of channel measurements from each\nsensor. For this purpose, we design a security protocol, in which Kalman\nfilters are used to predict the system-state and the channel-state values, and\nthe received data are authenticated by a hypothesis test. We theoretically\nanalyze the adversarial success probability and the reliability rate obtained\nin the hypothesis test in two ways, based on a chi-square approximation and on\na Gaussian approximation. The two approximations are exact for small and large\ndata vectors, respectively. The Gaussian approximation is suitable for\nanalyzing massive single-input multiple-output (SIMO) setups. To obtain\nadditional insights, the approximation is further adapted for the case of\nchannel hardening, which occurs in massive SIMO fading channels. As adversaries\nalways look for the weakest point of a system, a time-constant security level\nis required. To provide such a service, the approximations are used to propose\ntime-varying threshold values for the hypothesis test, which approximately\nattain a constant security level. Numerical results show that a constant\nsecurity level can only be achieved by a time-varying threshold choice, while a\nconstant threshold value leads to a time-varying security level.",

    "abstract": "Expert knowledge is required to interpret data across a range of fields.\nExperts bridge gaps that often exists in our knowledge about relationships\nbetween data and the parameters of interest. This is especially true in\ngeoscientific applications, where knowledge of the Earth is derived from\ninterpretations of observable features and relies on predominantly unproven but\nwidely accepted theories. Thus, experts facilitate solutions to otherwise\nunsolvable problems. However, experts are inherently subjective, and\nsusceptible to cognitive biases and adverse external effects. This work\nexamines this problem within geoscience. Three compelling examples are provided\nof the prevalence of cognitive biases from previous work. The problem is then\nformally defined, and a set of design principles which ensure that any solution\nis sufficiently flexible to be readily applied to the range of geoscientific\nproblems. No solutions exist that reliably capture and reduce cognitive bias in\nexperts. However, formal expert elicitation methods can be used to assess\nexpert variation, and a variety of approaches exist that may help to illuminate\nuncertainties, avoid misunderstandings, and reduce herding behaviours or\nsingle-expert over-dominance. This work combines existing and future approaches\nto reduce expert suboptimality through a flexible modular design where each\nmodule provides a specific function. The design centres around action modules\nthat force a stop-and-perform step into interpretation tasks. A starter-pack of\nmodules is provided as an example of the conceptual design.

    "title": "Smoothed Analysis of Information Spreading in Dynamic Networks",
    "abstract": "The best known solutions for $k$-message broadcast in dynamic networks of\nsize $n$ require $\\Omega(nk)$ rounds. In this paper, we see if these bounds can\nbe improved by smoothed analysis. We study perhaps the most natural randomized\nalgorithm for disseminating tokens in this setting: at every time step, choose\na token to broadcast randomly from the set of tokens you know. We show that\nwith even a small amount of smoothing (one random edge added per round), this\nnatural strategy solves $k$-message broadcast in $\\tilde{O}(n+k^3)$ rounds,\nwith high probability, beating the best known bounds for $k=o(\\sqrt{n})$ and\nmatching the $\\Omega(n+k)$ lower bound for static networks for $k=O(n^{1/3})$\n(ignoring logarithmic factors). In fact, the main result we show is even\nstronger and more general: given $\\ell$-smoothing (i.e., $\\ell$ random edges\nadded per round), this simple strategy terminates in\n$O(kn^{2/3}\\log^{1/3}(n)\\ell^{-1/3})$ rounds. We then prove this analysis close\nto tight with an almost-matching lower bound. To better understand the impact\nof smoothing on information spreading, we next turn our attention to static\nnetworks, proving a tight bound of $\\tilde{O}(k\\sqrt{n})$ rounds to solve\n$k$-message broadcast, which is better than what our strategy can achieve in\nthe dynamic setting. This confirms that although smoothed analysis reduces the\ndifficulties induced by changing graph structures, it does not eliminate them\naltogether. Finally, we apply our tools to prove an optimal result for\n$k$-message broadcast in so-called well-mixed networks in the absence of\nsmoothing. By comparing this result to an existing lower bound for well-mixed\nnetworks, we establish a formal separation between oblivious and strongly\nadaptive adversaries with respect to well-mixed token spreading, partially\nresolving an open question on the impact of adversary strength on the\n$k$-message broadcast problem.",

Random-like behavior, a continuous broadband power\nspectrum, and a weak baseline condition dependency are all characteristics of\nchaotic systems. Chaos could be helpful in the three functional components of\ncompression, encryption, and modulation in a digital communication system. To\nsuccessfully use chaos theory in cryptography, chaotic maps must be built in\nsuch a way that the entropy they produce can provide the necessary confusion\nand diffusion. A chaotic map is used in the first layer of such cryptosystems\nto create confusion, and a second chaotic map is used in the second layer to\ncreate diffusion and create a ciphertext from a plaintext. A secret key\ngeneration mechanism and a key exchange method are frequently left out, and\nmany researchers just assume that these essential components of any effective\ncryptosystem are always accessible. We review such cryptosystems by using a\ncryptosystem of our design, in which confusion in plaintext is created using\nArnold's Cat Map, and logistic mapping is employed to create sufficient\ndispersion and ultimately get a matching ciphertext. We also address the\ndevelopment of key exchange protocols and secret key schemes for these\ncryptosystems, as well as the possible outcomes of using cryptanalysis\ntechniques on such a system.",

For general graphs,\nFeldmann and Marx [ICALP 2016] characterized those families of demand graphs\nwhere the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized by the\nnumber k of terminals. They showed that if \\mathcal{D} is a superset of one of\nthe five hard families, then \\mathcal{D}-SN is W[1]-hard parameterized by k,\notherwise it can be solved in time f(k)n^{O(1)}.\nFor planar graphs an interesting question is whether the W[1]-hard cases can\nbe solved by subexponential parameterized algorithms.

    "abstract": "Context: Mutation Testing (MT) is an important tool in traditional Software\nEngineering (SE) white-box testing. It aims to artificially inject faults in a\nsystem to evaluate a test suite's capability to detect them, assuming that the\ntest suite defects finding capability will then translate to real faults. If MT\nhas long been used in SE, it is only recently that it started gaining the\nattention of the Deep Learning (DL) community, with researchers adapting it to\nimprove the testability of DL models and improve the trustworthiness of DL\nsystems.\nObjective: If several techniques have been proposed for MT, most of them\nneglected the stochasticity inherent to DL resulting from the training phase.\nEven the latest MT approaches in DL, which propose to tackle MT through a\nstatistical approach, might give inconsistent results. Indeed, as their\nstatistic is based on a fixed set of sampled training instances, it can lead to\ndifferent results across instances set when results should be consistent for\nany instance.\nMethods: In this work, we propose a Probabilistic Mutation Testing (PMT)\napproach that alleviates the inconsistency problem and allows for a more\nconsistent decision on whether a mutant is killed or not.\nResults: We show that PMT effectively allows a more consistent and informed\ndecision on mutations through evaluation using three models and eight mutation\noperators used in previously proposed MT methods. We also analyze the trade-off\nbetween the approximation error and the cost of our method, showing that\nrelatively small error can be achieved for a manageable cost.\nConclusion: Our results showed the limitation of current MT practices in DNN\nand the need to rethink them. We believe PMT is the first step in that\ndirection which effectively removes the lack of consistency across test\nexecutions of previous methods caused by the stochasticity of DNN training.",

In this\npaper, we present CORNET, a neuro-symbolic system that tackles the novel\nproblem of automatically learning such formatting rules from user examples of\nformatted cells. CORNET takes inspiration from inductive program synthesis and\ncombines symbolic rule enumeration, based on semi-supervised clustering and\niterative decision tree learning, with a neural ranker to produce conditional\nformatting rules. To motivate and evaluate our approach, we extracted tables\nwith formatting rules from a corpus of over 40K real spreadsheets.

Our\nresults show that CORNET can learn rules more accurately, across varying\nconditions, compared to these baselines.

    "abstract": "Much of software-engineering research relies on the naturalness of code, the\nfact that code, in small code snippets, is repetitive and can be predicted\nusing statistical language models like n-gram. Although powerful, training such\nmodels on large code corpus is tedious, time-consuming and sensitive to code\npatterns (and practices) encountered during training. Consequently, these\nmodels are often trained on a small corpora and estimate the language\nnaturalness that is relative to a specific style of programming or type of\nproject. To overcome these issues, we propose using pre-trained language models\nto infer code naturalness. Pre-trained models are often built on big data, are\neasy to use in an out-of-the-box way and include powerful learning associations\nmechanisms. Our key idea is to quantify code naturalness through its\npredictability, by using state-of-the-art generative pre-trained language\nmodels. To this end, we infer naturalness by masking (omitting) code tokens,\none at a time, of code-sequences, and checking the models' ability to predict\nthem. To this end, we evaluate three different predictability metrics; a)\nmeasuring the number of exact matches of the predictions, b) computing the\nembedding similarity between the original and predicted code, i.e., similarity\nat the vector space, and c) computing the confidence of the model when doing\nthe token completion task irrespective of the outcome. We implement this\nworkflow, named CodeBERT-nt, and evaluate its capability to prioritize buggy\nlines over non-buggy ones when ranking code based on its naturalness.

    "abstract": "Self-attention based transformer models have been dominating many computer\nvision tasks in the past few years. Their superb model qualities heavily depend\non the excessively large labeled image datasets. In order to reduce the\nreliance on large labeled datasets, reconstruction based masked autoencoders\nare gaining popularity, which learn high quality transferable representations\nfrom unlabeled images. For the same purpose, recent weakly supervised image\npretraining methods explore language supervision from text captions\naccompanying the images. In this work, we propose masked image pretraining on\nlanguage assisted representation, dubbed as MILAN. Instead of predicting raw\npixels or low level features, our pretraining objective is to reconstruct the\nimage features with substantial semantic signals that are obtained using\ncaption supervision. Moreover, to accommodate our reconstruction target, we\npropose a more efficient prompting decoder architecture and a semantic aware\nmask sampling mechanism, which further advance the transfer performance of the\npretrained model. Experimental results demonstrate that MILAN delivers higher\naccuracy than the previous works. When the masked autoencoder is pretrained and\nfinetuned on ImageNet-1K dataset with an input resolution of 224x224, MILAN\nachieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.4% on ViTB/16, surpassing previous\nstate-of-the-arts by 1%.

Current robotic sampling methods seek to\ngather information about an observable spatial field.

In our approach, we seek to reason about the latent\nphenomenon in real-time by effectively sampling the observable spatial fields\nusing a team of robots with heterogeneous sensors, where each robot has a\ndistinct sensor to measure a different observable field. The information gain\nis estimated using a learned model that maps from the observable spatial fields\nto the latent phenomenon. This model captures aleatoric uncertainty in the\nrelationship to allow for information theoretic measures. Additionally, we\nexplicitly consider the correlations among the observable spatial fields,\ncapturing the relationship between sensor types whose observations are not\nindependent. We show it is possible to learn these correlations, and\ninvestigate the impact of the learned correlation models on the performance of\nour sampling approach.

    "title": "Multiple RISs Assisted Cell-Free Networks With Two-timescale CSI:  Performance Analysis and System Design",
    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can be employed in a cell-free\nsystem to create favorable propagation conditions from base stations (BSs) to\nusers via configurable elements. However, prior works on RIS-aided cell-free\nsystem designs mainly rely on the instantaneous channel state information\n(CSI), which may incur substantial overhead due to extremely high dimensions of\nestimated channels. To mitigate this issue, a low-complexity algorithm via the\ntwo-timescale transmission protocol is proposed in this paper, where the joint\nbeamforming at BSs and RISs is facilitated via alternating optimization\nframework to maximize the average weighted sum-rate. Specifically, the passive\nbeamformers at RISs are optimized through the statistical CSI, and the transmit\nbeamformers at BSs are based on the instantaneous CSI of effective channels. In\nthis manner, a closed-form expression for the achievable weighted sum-rate is\nderived, which enables the evaluation of the impact of key parameters on system\nperformance. To gain more insights, a special case without line-of-sight (LoS)\ncomponents is further investigated, where a power gain on the order of\n$\\mathcal{O}(M)$ is achieved, with $M$ being the BS antennas number. Numerical\nresults validate the tightness of our derived analytical expression and show\nthe fast convergence of the proposed algorithm. Findings illustrate that the\nperformance of the proposed algorithm with two-timescale CSI is comparable to\nthat with instantaneous CSI in low or moderate SNR regime. The impact of key\nsystem parameters such as the number of RIS elements, CSI settings and Rician\nfactor is also evaluated. Moreover, the remarkable advantages from the adoption\nof the cell-free paradigm and the deployment of RISs are demonstrated\nintuitively.",

    "title": "Testing SOAR Tools in Use",
    "abstract": "Modern security operation centers (SOCs) rely on operators and a tapestry of\nlogging and alerting tools with large scale collection and query abilities. SOC\ninvestigations are tedious as they rely on manual efforts to query diverse data\nsources, overlay related logs, and correlate the data into information and then\ndocument results in a ticketing system. Security orchestration, automation, and\nresponse (SOAR) tools are a new technology that promise to collect, filter, and\ndisplay needed data; automate common tasks that require SOC analysts' time;\nfacilitate SOC collaboration; and, improve both efficiency and consistency of\nSOCs. SOAR tools have never been tested in practice to evaluate their effect\nand understand them in use. In this paper, we design and administer the first\nhands-on user study of SOAR tools, involving 24 participants and 6 commercial\nSOAR tools. Our contributions include the experimental design, itemizing six\ncharacteristics of SOAR tools and a methodology for testing them. We describe\nconfiguration of the test environment in a cyber range, including network,\nuser, and threat emulation; a full SOC tool suite; and creation of artifacts\nallowing multiple representative investigation scenarios to permit testing. We\npresent the first research results on SOAR tools. We found that SOAR\nconfiguration is critical, as it involves creative design for data display and\nautomation. We found that SOAR tools increased efficiency and reduced context\nswitching during investigations, although ticket accuracy and completeness\n(indicating investigation quality) decreased with SOAR use. Our findings\nindicated that user preferences are slightly negatively correlated with their\nperformance with the tool; overautomation was a concern of senior analysts, and\nSOAR tools that balanced automation with assisting a user to make decisions\nwere preferred.",

    "abstract": "As the next-generation Internet paradigm, Web 3.0 encapsulates the\nexpectations of user-centric immersion and interaction experiences in a\ndecentralized manner. Metaverse, a virtual world interacting with the physical\nworld, is becoming one of the most potential technology to push forward with\nWeb 3.0. In the Metaverse, users expect to tailor immersive and interactive\nexperiences by customizing real-time Metaverse services (e.g.,\naugmented/virtual reality and digital twin) in the three-dimensional virtual\nworld. Nevertheless, there are still no unified solutions for the Metaverse\nservices in terms of management and orchestration. It is calling for a\ncontinuous evolution of scalable solutions and mobile systems to support\nMetaverse services, and thus bring Metaverse into reality. In this paper, to\nprovide scalable subscription solutions for Metaverse services, we propose a\nnew concept, named Metaverse-as-a-Service (MaaS), in which various\nphysical-virtual components and technologies in the Metaverse can be delivered\nas services. Furthermore, to unify the management and orchestration of MaaS, we\npropose a novel framework, called Slicing4Meta, to customize Metaverse services\nby intelligently integrating MaaS models and the associated multi-dimensional\nresources on the components and technologies. Additionally, we propose the\nclassification for typical Metaverse services based on the quality of\nexperience (QoE) requirements and illustrate how to fulfill the QoE\nrequirements under the Slicing4Meta framework. We then illustrate a virtual\ntraveling study case, in which we examine the relationship between the QoE and\nthe multi-dimensional resources by quantitatively modeling the QoE of Metaverse\nusers. Finally, we discuss some open challenges of Slicing4Meta and propose\npotential solutions to address the challenges.",

    "abstract": "Deep Learning has greatly advanced the performance of semantic segmentation,\nhowever, its success relies on the availability of large amounts of annotated\ndata for training. Hence, many efforts have been devoted to domain adaptive\nsemantic segmentation that focuses on transferring semantic knowledge from a\nlabeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Existing self-training\nmethods typically require multiple rounds of training, while another popular\nframework based on adversarial training is known to be sensitive to\nhyper-parameters. In this paper, we present an easy-to-train framework that\nlearns domain-invariant prototypes for domain adaptive semantic segmentation.\nIn particular, we show that domain adaptation shares a common character with\nfew-shot learning in that both aim to recognize some types of unseen data with\nknowledge learned from large amounts of seen data. Thus, we propose a unified\nframework for domain adaptation and few-shot learning. The core idea is to use\nthe class prototypes extracted from few-shot annotated target images to\nclassify pixels of both source images and target images. Our method involves\nonly one-stage training and does not need to be trained on large-scale\nun-annotated target images. Moreover, our method can be extended to variants of\nboth domain adaptation and few-shot learning.

Action recommendation for smart home has attracted increasing attention\ndue to its potential impact on the markets of virtual assistants and Internet\nof Things (IoT). However, designing an effective action recommender system for\nsmart home is challenging because it requires handling context correlations,\nconsidering both queried contexts and previous histories of users, and dealing\nwith capricious intentions in history. In this work, we propose SmartSense, an\naccurate action recommendation method for smart home. For individual action,\nSmartSense summarizes its device control and its temporal contexts in a\nself-attentive manner, to reflect the importance of the correlation between\nthem. SmartSense then summarizes sequences of users considering queried\ncontexts in a query-attentive manner to extract the query-related patterns from\nthe sequential actions. SmartSense also transfers the commonsense knowledge\nfrom routine data to better handle intentions in action sequences. As a result,\nSmartSense addresses all three main challenges of action recommendation for\nsmart home, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance giving up to 9.8%\nhigher mAP@1 than the best competitor.",

Nevertheless, BFL tremendously\nescalates the communication traffic volume because all local model updates\n(i.e., changes of model parameters) obtained by BFL clients will be transmitted\nto all miners for verification and to all clients for aggregation. In contrast,\nthe parameter server and clients in VFL only retain aggregated model updates.\nConsequently, the huge communication traffic in BFL will inevitably impair the\ntraining efficiency and hinder the deployment of BFL in reality. To improve the\npracticality of BFL, we are among the first to propose a fast blockchain-based\ncommunication-efficient federated learning framework by compressing\ncommunications in BFL, called BCFL. Meanwhile, we derive the convergence rate\nof BCFL with non-convex loss. To maximize the final model accuracy, we further\nformulate the problem to minimize the training loss of the convergence rate\nsubject to a limited training time with respect to the compression rate and the\nblock generation rate, which is a bi-convex optimization problem and can be\nefficiently solved. To the end, to demonstrate the efficiency of BCFL, we carry\nout extensive experiments with standard CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets.

However, the distillation\ntechnique requires complicate multi-stage process and many training tricks.\nIn this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method that can achieve\ncompetitive performance to the advanced distillation methods. Our core idea is\nto fully explore the target-domain information from the views of boundaries and\nfeatures.\nFirst, we propose a novel mix-up strategy to generate high-quality\ntarget-domain boundaries with ground-truth labels. Different from the\nsource-domain boundaries in previous works, we select the high-confidence\ntarget-domain areas and then paste them to the source-domain images. Such a\nstrategy can generate the object boundaries in target domain (edge of\ntarget-domain object areas) with the correct labels. Consequently, the boundary\ninformation of target domain can be effectively captured by learning on the\nmixed-up samples.\nSecond, we design a multi-level contrastive loss to improve the\nrepresentation of target-domain data, including pixel-level and prototype-level\ncontrastive learning.\nBy combining two proposed methods, more discriminative features can be\nextracted and hard object boundaries can be better addressed for the target\ndomain.\nThe experimental results on two commonly adopted benchmarks (\\textit{i.e.},\nGTA5 $\\rightarrow$ Cityscapes and SYNTHIA $\\rightarrow$ Cityscapes) show that\nour method achieves competitive performance to complicated distillation\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Training deep neural networks (DNNs) is becoming more and more resource- and\nenergy-intensive every year. Unfortunately, existing works primarily focus on\noptimizing DNN training for faster completion, often without considering the\nimpact on energy efficiency.\nIn this paper, we observe that common practices to improve training\nperformance can often lead to inefficient energy usage. More importantly, we\ndemonstrate that there is a tradeoff between energy consumption and performance\noptimization. To this end, we propose an optimization framework, Zeus, to\nnavigate this tradeoff by automatically finding optimal job- and GPU-level\nconfigurations for recurring DNN training jobs. Zeus uses an online\nexploration-exploitation approach in conjunction with just-in-time energy\nprofiling, averting the need for expensive offline measurements, while adapting\nto data drifts over time. Our evaluation shows that Zeus can improve the energy\nefficiency of DNN training by 15.3%--75.8% for diverse workloads.",

    "abstract": "Data stream processing is an increasingly important topic due to the\nprevalence of smart devices and the demand for real-time analytics.\nGeo-distributed streaming systems, where cloud-based queries utilize data\nstreams from multiple distributed devices, face challenges since wide-area\nnetwork (WAN) bandwidth is often scarce or expensive. Edge computing allows us\nto address these bandwidth costs by utilizing resources close to the devices,\ne.g. to perform sampling over the incoming data streams, which trades\ndownstream query accuracy to reduce the overall transmission cost. In this\npaper, we leverage the fact that correlations between data streams may exist\nacross devices located in the same geographical region. Using this insight, we\ndevelop a hybrid edge-cloud system which systematically trades off between\nsampling at the edge and estimation of missing values in the cloud to reduce\ntraffic over the WAN. We present an optimization framework which computes\nsample sizes at the edge and systematically bounds the number of samples we can\nestimate in the cloud given the strength of the correlation between streams.\nOur evaluation with three real-world datasets shows that compared to existing\nsampling techniques, our system could provide comparable error rates over\nmultiple aggregate queries while reducing WAN traffic by 27-42%.",

However,\nfor real-life applications, it is very challenging to deploy efficient\nTransformers due to immense parameters and operations of models. To relieve\nthis burden, exploiting sparsity is an effective approach to accelerate\nTransformers. Newly emerging Ampere GPUs leverage a 2:4 sparsity pattern to\nachieve model acceleration, while it can hardly meet the diverse algorithm and\nhardware constraints when deploying models. By contrast, we propose an\nalgorithm-hardware co-optimized framework to flexibly and efficiently\naccelerate Transformers by utilizing general N:M sparsity patterns. (1) From\nalgorithm perspective, we propose a sparsity inheritance mechanism along with\nan inherited dynamic pruning (IDP) method to obtain a series of N:M sparse\ncandidate Transformers rapidly. A model compression scheme is further proposed\nto significantly reduce the storage requirement for deployment. (2) From\nhardware perspective, we present a flexible and efficient hardware\narchitecture, namely STA, to achieve significant speedup when deploying N:M\nsparse Transformers. STA features not only a computing engine unifying both\nsparse-dense and dense-dense matrix multiplications with high computational\nefficiency but also a scalable softmax module eliminating the latency from\nintermediate off-chip data communication. Experimental results show that\ncompared to other methods, N:M sparse Transformers, generated using IDP,\nachieves an average of 6.7% improvement on accuracy with high training\nefficiency. Moreover, STA can achieve 14.47x and 11.33x speedup compared to\nIntel i9-9900X and NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti, respectively, and perform 2.00-19.47x\nfaster inference than the state-of-the-art FPGA-based accelerators for\nTransformers.",

In light of this situation, this work looks into a different approach\nwhich has not been well investigated for instance image retrieval previously:\n{can we learn feature representation \\textit{specific to} a given retrieval\ntask in order to achieve excellent retrieval?} Our finding is encouraging. By\nadding an object proposal generator to generate image regions for\nself-supervised learning, the investigated approach can successfully learn\nfeature representation specific to a given dataset for retrieval.

We propose Hamiltonian neural networks\n(HNNs) with HMC and NUTS for solving Bayesian inference problems. Once trained,\nHNNs do not require numerical gradients of the target density during sampling.\nMoreover, they satisfy important properties such as perfect time reversibility\nand Hamiltonian conservation, making them well-suited for use within HMC and\nNUTS because stationarity can be shown. We also propose an HNN extension called\nlatent HNNs (L-HNNs), which are capable of predicting latent variable outputs.\nCompared to HNNs, L-HNNs offer improved expressivity and reduced integration\nerrors. Finally, we employ L-HNNs in NUTS with an online error monitoring\nscheme to prevent sample degeneracy in regions of low probability density. We\ndemonstrate L-HNNs in NUTS with online error monitoring on several examples\ninvolving complex, heavy-tailed, and high-local-curvature probability\ndensities. Overall, L-HNNs in NUTS with online error monitoring satisfactorily\ninferred these probability densities.

    "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of Android in the last decade, Android is\npopular among users as well as attackers. The vast number of android users\ngrabs the attention of attackers on android. Due to the continuous evolution of\nthe variety and attacking techniques of android malware, our detection methods\nshould need an update too. Most of the researcher's works are based on static\nfeatures, and very few focus on dynamic features. In this paper, we are filling\nthe literature gap by detecting android malware using System calls. We are\nrunning the malicious app in a monitored and controlled environment using an\nemulator to detect malware. Malicious behavior is activated with some simulated\nevents during its runtime to activate its hostile behavior. Logs collected\nduring the app's runtime are analyzed and fed to different machine learning\nmodels for Detection and Family classification of Malware. The result indicates\nthat K-Nearest Neighbor and the Decision Tree gave the highest accuracy in\nmalware detection and Family Classification respectively.",

    "abstract": "Visible light is a proper spectrum for secure wireless communications because\nof its high directivity and impermeability. To make visible light communication\n(VLC) even more secure, we propose to exploit recently synthesized gold\nnanoparticles (GNPs) with chiroptical properties for circularly polarized\nlight. Carefully synthesized GNPs can differentially absorb and retard the left\nand right circularly polarized light, and a GNP plate made by judiciously\nstacking many GNPs can elaborately manipulate the amplitudes and phases of left\nand right circularly polarized light. In the proposed VLC system with multiple\ntransmitters, each transmitter is equipped with a GNP plate and a linear\npolarizer while the legitimate receiver is equipped with only a linear\npolarizer. A new VLC channel model is first developed by representing the\neffect of GNP plates and linear polarizers in the circular polarization domain.\nBased on the new channel model, the angles of linear polarizers at the\ntransmitters and legitimate receiver are optimized considering the effect of\nGNP plates to increase the secrecy rate in wiretapping scenarios. Simulation\nresults verify that when the transmitters are equipped with the GNP plates, the\nsecrecy rate around the legitimate receiver is significantly improved due to\nthe chiroptical properties of GNP plates even if a nearby eavesdropper sets the\nlinear polarizer angle same as the legitimate receiver.",

As a fundamental task in analyzing heterogeneous graphs,\nrelevance measure aims to calculate the relevance between two objects of\ndifferent types, which has been used in many applications such as web search,\nrecommendation, and community detection. Most of existing relevance measures\nfocus on homogeneous networks where objects are of the same type, and a few\nmeasures are developed for heterogeneous graphs, but they often need the\npre-defined meta-path. Defining meaningful meta-paths requires much domain\nknowledge, which largely limits their applications, especially on schema-rich\nheterogeneous graphs like knowledge graphs. Recently, the Graph Neural Network\n(GNN) has been widely applied in many graph mining tasks, but it has not been\napplied for measuring relevance yet. To address the aforementioned problems, we\npropose a novel GNN-based relevance measure, namely GSim. Specifically, we\nfirst theoretically analyze and show that GNN is effective for measuring the\nrelevance of nodes in the graph. We then propose a context path-based graph\nneural network (CP-GNN) to automatically leverage the semantics in\nheterogeneous graphs. Moreover, we exploit CP-GNN to support relevance measures\nbetween two objects of any type. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GSim\noutperforms existing measures.",

    "abstract": "The crux of text-to-image synthesis stems from the difficulty of preserving\nthe cross-modality semantic consistency between the input text and the\nsynthesized image. Typical methods, which seek to model the text-to-image\nmapping directly, could only capture keywords in the text that indicates common\nobjects or actions but fail to learn their spatial distribution patterns. An\neffective way to circumvent this limitation is to generate an image layout as\nguidance, which is attempted by a few methods. Nevertheless, these methods fail\nto generate practically effective layouts due to the diversity of input text\nand object location. In this paper we push for effective modeling in both\ntext-to-layout generation and layout-to-image synthesis. Specifically, we\nformulate the text-to-layout generation as a sequence-to-sequence modeling\ntask, and build our model upon Transformer to learn the spatial relationships\nbetween objects by modeling the sequential dependencies between them. In the\nstage of layout-to-image synthesis, we focus on learning the textual-visual\nsemantic alignment per object in the layout to precisely incorporate the input\ntext into the layout-to-image synthesizing process. To evaluate the quality of\ngenerated layout, we design a new metric specifically, dubbed Layout Quality\nScore, which considers both the absolute distribution errors of bounding boxes\nin the layout and the mutual spatial relationships between them. Extensive\nexperiments on three datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our\nmethod over state-of-the-art methods on both predicting the layout and\nsynthesizing the image from the given text.",

    "abstract": "Gradient inversion attacks on federated learning systems reconstruct client\ntraining data from exchanged gradient information. To defend against such\nattacks, a variety of defense mechanisms were proposed. However, they usually\nlead to an unacceptable trade-off between privacy and model utility. Recent\nobservations suggest that dropout could mitigate gradient leakage and improve\nmodel utility if added to neural networks. Unfortunately, this phenomenon has\nnot been systematically researched yet. In this work, we thoroughly analyze the\neffect of dropout on iterative gradient inversion attacks. We find that state\nof the art attacks are not able to reconstruct the client data due to the\nstochasticity induced by dropout during model training. Nonetheless, we argue\nthat dropout does not offer reliable protection if the dropout induced\nstochasticity is adequately modeled during attack optimization. Consequently,\nwe propose a novel Dropout Inversion Attack (DIA) that jointly optimizes for\nclient data and dropout masks to approximate the stochastic client model. We\nconduct an extensive systematic evaluation of our attack on four seminal model\narchitectures and three image classification datasets of increasing complexity.\nWe find that our proposed attack bypasses the protection seemingly induced by\ndropout and reconstructs client data with high fidelity. Our work demonstrates\nthat privacy inducing changes to model architectures alone cannot be assumed to\nreliably protect from gradient leakage and therefore should be combined with\ncomplementary defense mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Despite the development of ranking optimization techniques, the pointwise\nmodel remains the dominating approach for click-through rate (CTR) prediction.\nIt can be attributed to the calibration ability of the pointwise model since\nthe prediction can be viewed as the click probability. In practice, a CTR\nprediction model is also commonly assessed with the ranking ability, for which\nprediction models based on ranking losses (e.g., pairwise or listwise loss)\nusually achieve better performances than the pointwise loss. Previous studies\nhave experimented with a direct combination of the two losses to obtain the\nbenefit from both losses and observed an improved performance. However,\nprevious studies break the meaning of output logit as the click-through rate,\nwhich may lead to sub-optimal solutions. To address this issue, we propose an\napproach that can Jointly optimize the Ranking and Calibration abilities (JRC\nfor short). JRC improves the ranking ability by contrasting the logit value for\nthe sample with different labels and constrains the predicted probability to be\na function of the logit subtraction. We further show that JRC consolidates the\ninterpretation of logits, where the logits model the joint distribution. With\nsuch an interpretation, we prove that JRC approximately optimizes the\ncontextualized hybrid discriminative-generative objective. Experiments on\npublic and industrial datasets and online A/B testing show that our approach\nimproves both ranking and calibration abilities. Since May 2022, JRC has been\ndeployed on the display advertising platform of Alibaba and has obtained\nsignificant performance improvements.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a novel framework of decentralized machine\nlearning. Due to the decentralized feature of FL, it is vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks in the training procedure, e.g. , backdoor attacks. A\nbackdoor attack aims to inject a backdoor into the machine learning model such\nthat the model will make arbitrarily incorrect behavior on the test sample with\nsome specific backdoor trigger. Even though a range of backdoor attack methods\nof FL has been introduced, there are also methods defending against them. Many\nof the defending methods utilize the abnormal characteristics of the models\nwith backdoor or the difference between the models with backdoor and the\nregular models. To bypass these defenses, we need to reduce the difference and\nthe abnormal characteristics. We find a source of such abnormality is that\nbackdoor attack would directly flip the label of data when poisoning the data.\nHowever, current studies of the backdoor attack in FL are not mainly focus on\nreducing the difference between the models with backdoor and the regular\nmodels. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Knowledge Distillation(ADVKD), a\nmethod combine knowledge distillation with backdoor attack in FL. With\nknowledge distillation, we can reduce the abnormal characteristics in model\nresult from the label flipping, thus the model can bypass the defenses.\nCompared to current methods, we show that ADVKD can not only reach a higher\nattack success rate, but also successfully bypass the defenses when other\nmethods fails. To further explore the performance of ADVKD, we test how the\nparameters affect the performance of ADVKD under different scenarios. According\nto the experiment result, we summarize how to adjust the parameter for better\nperformance under different scenarios. We also use several methods to visualize\nthe effect of different attack and explain the effectiveness of ADVKD.",

    "abstract": "We study status updating under two-way delay in a system consisting of a\nsampler, a sink, and a controller residing at the sink. The controller controls\nthe sampling process by sending request packets to the sampler. Upon receiving\na request, the sampler generates a sample and transmits the status update\npacket to the sink. Transmissions of both request and status update packets\nencounter random delays. We develop optimal control policies to minimize the\naverage age of information (AoI) using the tools of Markov decision processes\nin two scenarios. We begin with the system having at most one active request,\ni.e., a generated request for which the sink has not yet received a status\nupdate packet. Then, as the main distinctive feature of this paper, we initiate\npipelining-type status updating by studying a system having at most two active\nrequests. Furthermore, we conduct AoI analysis by deriving the average AoI\nexpressions for the Zero-Wait-1, Zero-Wait-2, and Wait-1 policies. According to\nthe Zero-Wait-1 policy, whenever a status update packet is delivered to the\nsink, a new request packet is inserted into the system. The Zero-Wait-2 policy\noperates similarly, except that the system holds two active requests. According\nto the Wait-1 policy, whenever a status update packet is delivered to the sink,\na new request is sent after a waiting time which is a function of the current\nAoI.

    "abstract": "In recent years we have seen the exponential growth of applications,\nincluding dialogue systems, that handle sensitive personal information. This\nhas brought to light the extremely important issue regarding personal data\nprotection in virtual environments. Firstly, a performing model should be able\nto distinguish sentences with sensitive content from neutral sentences.\nSecondly, it should be able to identify the type of personal data category\ncontained in them. In this way, a different privacy treatment could be\nconsidered for each category. In literature, if there are works on automatic\nsensitive data identification, these are often conducted on different domains\nor languages without a common benchmark. To fill this gap, in this work we\nintroduce SPeDaC, a new annotated benchmark for the identification of sensitive\npersonal data categories. Furthermore, we provide an extensive evaluation of\nour dataset, conducted using different baselines and a classifier based on\nRoBERTa, a neural architecture that achieves strong performances on the\ndetection of sensitive sentences and on the personal data categories\nclassification.",

    "abstract": "Traditional pixel-wise image attack algorithms suffer from poor robustness to\ndefense algorithms, i.e., the attack strength degrades dramatically when\ndefense algorithms are applied. Although Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)\ncan partially address this problem by synthesizing a more semantically\nmeaningful texture pattern, the main limitation is that existing generators can\nonly generate images of a specific scale. In this paper, we propose a\nscale-free generation-based attack algorithm that synthesizes semantically\nmeaningful adversarial patterns globally to images with arbitrary scales. Our\ngenerative attack approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods on a wide range of attack settings, i.e. the proposed approach largely\ndegraded the performance of various image classification, object detection, and\ninstance segmentation algorithms under different advanced defense methods.",

Known protocols in a synchronous network\nare secure against $Q^{(3)}$ adversary structures, while in an asynchronous\nnetwork, known protocols are secure against $Q^{(4)}$ adversary structures. A\nnatural question is whether there exists a single protocol which remains secure\nagainst $Q^{(3)}$ and $Q^{(4)}$ adversary structures in a synchronous and in an\nasynchronous network respectively, where the parties are not aware of the\nnetwork type. We design the first such best-of-both-worlds protocol against\ngeneral adversaries. Our result generalizes the result of Appan, Chandramouli\nand Choudhury (PODC 2022), which presents a best-of-both-worlds\nperfectly-secure protocol against threshold adversaries.\nTo design our protocol, we present two important building blocks which are of\nindependent interest. The first building block is a best-of-both-worlds\nperfectly-secure Byzantine agreement (BA) protocol for $Q^{(3)}$ adversary\nstructures, which remains secure both in a synchronous, as well as an\nasynchronous network.

In\nthis paper we describe a new self-organized method of authentication for\nVANETs, which allows their widespread, fast and secure implementation. Our\nproposal does not involve any central certification authority because the nodes\nthemselves certify the validity of public keys of the other nodes. On the one\nhand we propose an algorithm that each node must use to choose the public key\ncertificates for its local store. On the other hand, we also describe a new\nnode authentication method based on a cryptographic protocol including a\nzero-knowledge proof that each node must use to convince another node on the\npossession of certain secret without revealing anything about it, which allows\nnon-encrypted communication during authentication. Thanks to the combination of\nthe aforementioned tools, the cooperation among vehicles can be used for\ndeveloping several practical applications of VANETs, such as detection and\nwarning about abnormal traffic conditions. One of the most interesting aspects\nof our proposal is that it only requires existing devices such as smartphones,\nbecause the designed schemes are fully distributed and self-organized.

With the\nhelp of inertial measurement unit informations, each camera's position data can\nbe transferred into the unified world coordinate system.

The main challenge identified and addressed is the resolution of the\ndouble-sided dependency between scenario and simulation models.

    "abstract": "Finding optimal bidding strategies for generation units in electricity\nmarkets would result in higher profit. However, it is a challenging problem due\nto the system uncertainty which is due to the unknown other generation units'\nstrategies. Distributed optimization, where each entity or agent decides on its\nbid individually, has become state of the art. However, it cannot overcome the\nchallenges of system uncertainties. Deep reinforcement learning is a promising\napproach to learn the optimal strategy in uncertain environments. Nevertheless,\nit is not able to integrate the information on the spatial system topology in\nthe learning process. This paper proposes a distributed learning algorithm\nbased on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with a graph convolutional\nneural network (GCN). In fact, the proposed framework helps the agents to\nupdate their decisions by getting feedback from the environment so that it can\novercome the challenges of the uncertainties. In this proposed algorithm, the\nstate and connection between nodes are the inputs of the GCN, which can make\nagents aware of the structure of the system. This information on the system\ntopology helps the agents to improve their bidding strategies and increase the\nprofit. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on the IEEE 30-bus system under\ndifferent scenarios. Also, to investigate the generalization ability of the\nproposed approach, we test the trained model on IEEE 39-bus system. The results\nshow that the proposed algorithm has more generalization abilities compare to\nthe DRL and can result in higher profit when changing the topology of the\nsystem.",

In this model, a player\nneeds to choose one of K possible arms of a bandit machine to play at each time\nstep, where the corresponding arm returns a random reward to the player,\npotentially from a specific unknown distribution. The target of the player is\nto collect as much rewards as possible during the process. Despite its\nsimplicity, the MAB model offers an excellent playground for studying the\ntrade-off between exploration versus exploitation and designing effective\nalgorithms for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Although many\nasymptotically optimal algorithms have been established, the finite-time\nbehaviours of the stochastic dynamics of the MAB model appears much more\ndifficult to analyze, due to the intertwining between the decision-making and\nthe rewards being collected.

Our model allows\nstate-of-the-art estimation of user interests in the following ubiquitous\nrecommender system scenario: A user is shown a slate of K recommendations and\nthe user chooses at most one of these K items. It is the goal of the\nrecommender system to find the K items of most interest to a user in order to\nmaximize the probability that the user interacts with the slate. Our\ncontribution is to show that we can learn more effectively the probability of\nthe recommendations being successful by combining the reward - whether the\nslate was clicked or not - and the rank - the item on the slate that was\nselected. Our method learns more efficiently than bandit methods that use only\nthe reward, and user preference methods that use only the rank. It also\nprovides similar or better estimation performance to independent\ninverse-propensity-score methods and is far more scalable. Our method is state\nof the art in terms of both speed and accuracy on massive datasets with up to 1\nmillion items.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems (RSs) aim to help users to effectively retrieve items of\ntheir interests from a large catalogue. For a quite long period of time,\nresearchers and practitioners have been focusing on developing accurate RSs.\nRecent years have witnessed an increasing number of threats to RSs, coming from\nattacks, system and user generated noise, system bias. As a result, it has\nbecome clear that a strict focus on RS accuracy is limited and the research\nmust consider other important factors, e.g., trustworthiness. For end users, a\ntrustworthy RS (TRS) should not only be accurate, but also transparent,\nunbiased and fair as well as robust to noise or attacks. These observations\nactually led to a paradigm shift of the research on RSs: from accuracy-oriented\nRSs to TRSs. However, researchers lack a systematic overview and discussion of\nthe literature in this novel and fast developing field of TRSs. To this end, in\nthis paper, we provide an overview of TRSs, including a discussion of the\nmotivation and basic concepts of TRSs, a presentation of the challenges in\nbuilding TRSs, and a perspective on the future directions in this area. We also\nprovide a novel conceptual framework to support the construction of TRSs.",

    "abstract": "One of the common ways children learn is by mimicking adults. Imitation\nlearning focuses on learning policies with suitable performance from\ndemonstrations generated by an expert, with an unspecified performance measure,\nand unobserved reward signal. Popular methods for imitation learning start by\neither directly mimicking the behavior policy of an expert (behavior cloning)\nor by learning a reward function that prioritizes observed expert trajectories\n(inverse reinforcement learning). However, these methods rely on the assumption\nthat covariates used by the expert to determine her/his actions are fully\nobserved. In this paper, we relax this assumption and study imitation learning\nwhen sensory inputs of the learner and the expert differ. First, we provide a\nnon-parametric, graphical criterion that is complete (both necessary and\nsufficient) for determining the feasibility of imitation from the combinations\nof demonstration data and qualitative assumptions about the underlying\nenvironment, represented in the form of a causal model. We then show that when\nsuch a criterion does not hold, imitation could still be feasible by exploiting\nquantitative knowledge of the expert trajectories. Finally, we develop an\nefficient procedure for learning the imitating policy from experts'\ntrajectories.",

By hierarchy,\nwe mean, e.g., short road edges and short bush edges amount to intermediate\nfeatures of landmarks; but intermediate features from tree shadows are\ndistractors that must be disregarded by the high-level landmark concept. By\ndynamic, we mean the automatic selection of features while disregarding\ndistractors is not static, but instead based on dynamic statistics (e.g.\nbecause of the instability of shadows in the context of landmark). By internal\nfeatures, we mean that they are not only sensory, but also motor, so that\ncontext from motor (state) integrates with sensory inputs to become a\ncontext-based logic machine. We present why strong AI is necessary for any\npractical AI systems that work reliably in the real world. We then present a\nnew generation of Developmental Networks 2 (DN-2). With many new novelties\nbeyond DN-1, the most important novelty of DN-2 is that the inhibition area of\neach internal neuron is neuron-specific and dynamic. This enables DN-2 to\nautomatically construct an internal hierarchy that is fluid, whose number of\nareas is not static as in DN-1.

    "abstract": "Segmenting dental plaque from images of medical reagent staining provides\nvaluable information for diagnosis and the determination of follow-up treatment\nplan. However, accurate dental plaque segmentation is a challenging task that\nrequires identifying teeth and dental plaque subjected to semantic-blur regions\n(i.e., confused boundaries in border regions between teeth and dental plaque)\nand complex variations of instance shapes, which are not fully addressed by\nexisting methods. Therefore, we propose a semantic decomposition network\n(SDNet) that introduces two single-task branches to separately address the\nsegmentation of teeth and dental plaque and designs additional constraints to\nlearn category-specific features for each branch, thus facilitating the\nsemantic decomposition and improving the performance of dental plaque\nsegmentation. Specifically, SDNet learns two separate segmentation branches for\nteeth and dental plaque in a divide-and-conquer manner to decouple the\nentangled relation between them. Each branch that specifies a category tends to\nyield accurate segmentation. To help these two branches better focus on\ncategory-specific features, two constraint modules are further proposed: 1)\ncontrastive constraint module (CCM) to learn discriminative feature\nrepresentations by maximizing the distance between different category\nrepresentations, so as to reduce the negative impact of semantic-blur regions\non feature extraction; 2) structural constraint module (SCM) to provide\ncomplete structural information for dental plaque of various shapes by the\nsupervision of an boundary-aware geometric constraint. Besides, we construct a\nlarge-scale open-source Stained Dental Plaque Segmentation dataset (SDPSeg),\nwhich provides high-quality annotations for teeth and dental plaque.\nExperimental results on SDPSeg datasets show SDNet achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance.",

However, it is a tedious\nwork to collect IS and IE data along grid lines covering a large target area\nfor characterization of subsurface defects. On the other hand, data processing\nis very complicated that requires domain experts to interpret the results. To\naddress the above problems, we present a novel robotic inspection system named\nas Impact-Rover to automate the data collection process and introduce data\nanalytics software to visualize the inspection result allowing regular\nnon-professional people to understand. The system consists of three modules: 1)\na robotic platform with vertical mobility to collect IS and IE data in\nhard-to-reach locations, 2) vision-based positioning module that fuses the\nRGB-D camera, IMU and wheel encoder to estimate the 6-DOF pose of the robot, 3)\na data analytics software module for processing the IS data to generate defect\nmaps. The Impact-Rover hosts both IE and IS devices on a sliding mechanism and\ncan perform move-stop-sample operations to collect multiple IS and IE data at\nadjustable spacing. The robot takes samples much faster than the manual data\ncollection method because it automatically takes the multiple measurements\nalong a straight line and records the locations. This paper focuses on\nreporting experimental results on IS. We calculate features and use\nunsupervised learning methods for analyzing the data.

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in autonomous driving systems, accidents such as the\nfatal Uber crash in 2018 show these systems are still susceptible to edge\ncases. Such systems must be thoroughly tested and validated before being\ndeployed in the real world to avoid such events. Testing in open-world\nscenarios can be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. These challenges can\nbe addressed by using driving simulators such as CARLA instead. A key part of\nsuch tests is adversarial testing, in which the goal is to find scenarios that\nlead to failures of the given system. While several independent efforts in\ntesting have been made, a well-established testing framework that enables\nadversarial testing has yet to be made available for CARLA. We therefore\npropose ANTI-CARLA, an automated testing framework in CARLA for simulating\nadversarial weather conditions (e.g., heavy rain) and sensor faults (e.g.,\ncamera occlusion) that fail the system. The operating conditions in which a\ngiven system should be tested are specified in a scenario description language.\nThe framework offers an efficient search mechanism that searches for\nadversarial operating conditions that will fail the tested system. In this way,\nANTI-CARLA extends the CARLA simulator with the capability of performing\nadversarial testing on any given driving pipeline. We use ANTI-CARLA to test\nthe driving pipeline trained with Learning By Cheating (LBC) approach. The\nsimulation results demonstrate that ANTI-CARLA can effectively and\nautomatically find a range of failure cases despite LBC reaching an accuracy of\n100% in the CARLA benchmark.",

    "title": "Handling Constrained Optimization in Factor Graphs for Autonomous  Navigation",
    "abstract": "Factor graphs are graphical models used to represent a wide variety of\nproblems across robotics, such as Structure from Motion (SfM), Simultaneous\nLocalization and Mapping (SLAM) and calibration. Typically, at their core, they\nhave an optimization problem whose terms only depend on a small subset of\nvariables. Factor graph solvers exploit the locality of problems to drastically\nreduce the computational time of the Iterative Least-Squares (ILS) methodology.\nAlthough extremely powerful, their application is usually limited to\nunconstrained problems. In this paper, we model constraints over variables\nwithin factor graphs by introducing a factor graph version of the method of\nLagrange Multipliers. We show the potential of our method by presenting a full\nnavigation stack based on factor graphs. Differently from standard navigation\nstacks, we can model both optimal control for local planning and localization\nwith factor graphs, and solve the two problems using the standard ILS\nmethodology. We validate our approach in real-world autonomous navigation\nscenarios, comparing it with the de facto standard navigation stack implemented\nin ROS. Comparative experiments show that for the application at hand our\nsystem outperforms the standard nonlinear programming solver Interior-Point\nOptimizer (IPOPT) in runtime, while achieving similar solutions.",

    "abstract": "Task-based programming models have risen in popularity as an alternative to\ntraditional fork-join parallelism. They are better suited to write applications\nwith irregular parallelism that can present load imbalance. However, these\nprogramming models suffer from overheads related to task creation, scheduling\nand dependency management, limiting performance and scalability when tasks\nbecome too small. At the same time, many HPC applications implement iterative\nmethods or multi-step simulations that create the same directed acyclic graphs\nof tasks on each iteration.\nBy giving application programmers a way to express that a specific loop is\ncreating the same task pattern on each iteration, we can create a single task\nDAG once and transform it into a cyclic graph. This cyclic graph is then reused\nfor successive iterations, minimizing task creation and dependency management\noverhead. This paper presents the taskiter, a new construct we propose for the\nOmpSs-2 and OpenMP programming models, allowing the use of directed cyclic task\ngraphs (DCTG) to minimize runtime overheads. Moreover, we present a simple\nimmediate successor locality-aware heuristic that minimizes task scheduling\noverhead by bypassing the runtime task scheduler.\nWe evaluate the implementation of the taskiter and the immediate successor\nheuristic in 8 iterative benchmarks. Using small task granularities, we obtain\nan average speedup of 3.7x over the reference OmpSs-2 implementation and an\naverage of 5x and 7.46x speedup over the LLVM and GCC OpenMP runtimes,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a method to reconstruct the neural radiance field with\nequirectangular omnidirectional images. Implicit neural scene representation\nwith a radiance field can reconstruct the 3D shape of a scene continuously\nwithin a limited spatial area. However, training a fully implicit\nrepresentation on commercial PC hardware requires a lot of time and computing\nresources (15 $\\sim$ 20 hours per scene). Therefore, we propose a method to\naccelerate this process significantly (20 $\\sim$ 40 minutes per scene). Instead\nof using a fully implicit representation of rays for radiance field\nreconstruction, we adopt feature voxels that contain density and color features\nin tensors. Considering omnidirectional equirectangular input and the camera\nlayout, we use spherical voxelization for representation instead of cubic\nrepresentation. Our voxelization method could balance the reconstruction\nquality of the inner scene and outer scene. In addition, we adopt the\naxis-aligned positional encoding method on the color features to increase the\ntotal image quality. Our method achieves satisfying empirical performance on\nsynthetic datasets with random camera poses. Moreover, we test our method with\nreal scenes which contain complex geometries and also achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance.

Bi-directional sketching enables virtual sketches and\nphysical objects to \"affect\" each other through physical actuation and digital\ncomputation. In the existing AR sketching, the relationship between virtual and\nphysical worlds is only one-directional -- while physical interaction can\naffect virtual sketches, virtual sketches have no return effect on the physical\nobjects or environment. In contrast, bi-directional sketching interaction\nallows the seamless coupling between sketches and actuated TUIs.

In our system, virtual sketches drawn and\nsimulated on an iPad (e.g., lines, walls, pendulums, and springs) can move,\nactuate, collide, and constrain physical Toio robots, as if virtual sketches\nand the physical objects exist in the same space through seamless coupling\nbetween AR and robot motion.

Of particular\ninterest is the ability of VCSELs to exhibit neural-like spiking responses,\nmuch like biological neurons, but at ultrafast sub-nanosecond rates; thus\noffering great prospects for high-speed light-enabled neuromorphic\n(spike-based) processors. Recent works have shown the use the spiking dynamics\nin VCSELs for pattern recognition and image processing problems such as image\ndata encoding and edge-feature detection. Additionally, VCSELs have also been\nused recently as nonlinear elements in photonic reservoir computing (RC)\nimplementations, yielding excellent state of the art operation. This work\nintroduces and experimentally demonstrates for the first time the new concept\nof a Ghz-rate photonic spiking neural network (SNN) built with a single VCSEL\nneuron.

    "abstract": "Towards the informed design of large-scale distributed data-gathering\narchitectures under real-world assumptions such as nonzero communication delays\nand unknown environment dynamics, this paper considers the effects of allowing\nfeedback communication from the central processor to external sensors. Using\nsimple but representative state-estimation examples, we investigate fundamental\ntradeoffs between the mean-squared error (MSE) of the central processor's\nestimate of the environment state, and the total power expenditure per sensor\nunder more conventional architectures without feedback (INformation) versus\nthose with broadcast feedback (OUTformation). The primary advantage of enabling\nfeedback is that each sensor's understanding of the central processor's\nestimate improves, which enables each sensor to determine when and what parts\nof its current observations to transmit. We use theory to demonstrate\nconditions in which OUTformation maintains the same MSE as INformation with\nless power expended on average, and conditions in which OUTformation obtains\nless MSE than INformation at additional power cost. These performance tradeoffs\nare also considered under settings where environments undergo less variation,\nand sensors implement random backoff times to prevent transmission collisions.\nOur results are supported via numerical studies, which show that the properties\nderived in theory still hold even when some of the simplifying assumptions are\nremoved.",

    "title": "AutoShard: Automated Embedding Table Sharding for Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Embedding learning is an important technique in deep recommendation models to\nmap categorical features to dense vectors. However, the embedding tables often\ndemand an extremely large number of parameters, which become the storage and\nefficiency bottlenecks. Distributed training solutions have been adopted to\npartition the embedding tables into multiple devices. However, the embedding\ntables can easily lead to imbalances if not carefully partitioned. This is a\nsignificant design challenge of distributed systems named embedding table\nsharding, i.e., how we should partition the embedding tables to balance the\ncosts across devices, which is a non-trivial task because 1) it is hard to\nefficiently and precisely measure the cost, and 2) the partition problem is\nknown to be NP-hard. In this work, we introduce our novel practice in Meta,\nnamely AutoShard, which uses a neural cost model to directly predict the\nmulti-table costs and leverages deep reinforcement learning to solve the\npartition problem. Experimental results on an open-sourced large-scale\nsynthetic dataset and Meta's production dataset demonstrate the superiority of\nAutoShard over the heuristics. Moreover, the learned policy of AutoShard can\ntransfer to sharding tasks with various numbers of tables and different ratios\nof the unseen tables without any fine-tuning. Furthermore, AutoShard can\nefficiently shard hundreds of tables in seconds. The effectiveness,\ntransferability, and efficiency of AutoShard make it desirable for production\nuse. Our algorithms have been deployed in Meta production environment. A\nprototype is available at https://github.com/daochenzha/autoshard",

Recent approaches have tackled this\nproblem by learning a uniform approximation of the game's utilities, and then\napplying precision-recall theorems: i.e., all equilibria of the true game are\napproximate equilibria in the estimated game, and vice-versa. In this work, we\ngeneralize this approach to all game properties that are well behaved (i.e.,\nLipschitz continuous in utilities), including regret (which defines Nash and\ncorrelated equilibria), adversarial values, and power-mean and Gini social\nwelfare. Further, we introduce a novel algorithm -- progressive sampling with\npruning (PSP) -- for learning a uniform approximation and thus any well-behaved\nproperty of a game, which prunes strategy profiles once the corresponding\nplayers' utilities are well-estimated, and we analyze its data and query\ncomplexities in terms of the a priori unknown utility variances. We experiment\nwith our algorithm extensively, showing that 1) the number of queries that PSP\nsaves is highly sensitive to the utility variance distribution, and 2) PSP\nconsistently outperforms theoretical upper bounds, achieving significantly\nlower query complexities than natural baselines.

Uncertainty\nestimation is an efficient solution to this problem, as it provides a measure\nof confidence in the segmentation results. The current uncertainty estimation\nmethods based on quantile regression, Bayesian neural network, ensemble, and\nMonte Carlo dropout are limited by their high computational cost and\ninconsistency. In order to overcome these challenges, Evidential Deep Learning\n(EDL) was developed in recent work but primarily for natural image\nclassification. In this paper, we proposed a region-based EDL segmentation\nframework that can generate reliable uncertainty maps and robust segmentation\nresults. We used the Theory of Evidence to interpret the output of a neural\nnetwork as evidence values gathered from input features. Following Subjective\nLogic, evidence was parameterized as a Dirichlet distribution, and predicted\nprobabilities were treated as subjective opinions. To evaluate the performance\nof our model on segmentation and uncertainty estimation, we conducted\nquantitative and qualitative experiments on the BraTS 2020 dataset. The results\ndemonstrated the top performance of the proposed method in quantifying\nsegmentation uncertainty and robustly segmenting tumors.

In\nthis paper, we propose Multi-channel Equivariant Attention Network (MEAN), an\nend-to-end model that is able to co-design 1D sequences and 3D structures of\nCDRs. To be specific, MEAN formulates antibody design as a conditional graph\ntranslation problem by importing extra components including the target antigen\nand the light chain of the antibody. Then, MEAN resorts to E(3)-equivariant\nmessage passing along with a proposed attention mechanism to better capture the\ngeometrical correlation between different components. Finally, it outputs both\nthe 1D sequences and 3D structure via a multi-round progressive full-shot\nscheme, which enjoys more efficiency against previous autoregressive\napproaches. Our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art models in\nsequence and structure modeling, antigen-binding antibody design, and binding\naffinity optimization.

    "abstract": "High-throughput DFT calculations are key to screening existing/novel\nmaterials, sampling potential energy surfaces, and generating quantum\nmechanical data for machine learning. By including a fraction of exact exchange\n(EXX), hybrid functionals reduce the self-interaction error in semi-local DFT\nand furnish a more accurate description of the underlying electronic structure,\nalbeit at a high computational cost that often prohibits such high-throughput\napplications. To address this challenge, we have constructed SeA\n(SeA=SCDM+exx+ACE), a robust, accurate, and efficient framework for\nhigh-throughput condensed-phase hybrid DFT by combining: (1) the non-iterative\nselected columns of the density matrix (SCDM) orbital localization scheme, (2)\na black-box and linear-scaling EXX algorithm (exx), and (3) adaptively\ncompressed exchange (ACE). By considering a diverse set of aqueous\nconfigurations, SeA yields ~20x speedup in the rate-determining step in the\nconvolution-based ACE implementation in Quantum ESPRESSO, while reproducing the\nEXX energy and ionic forces with high fidelity. In doing so, SeA effectively\nremoves the computational bottleneck that prohibits the routine use of hybrid\nDFT in high-throughput applications, providing an ~6x speedup in the overall\ncost of the ACE algorithm (and >100x overall speedup when compared to the\nconventional EXX implementation) for systems similar in size to (H2O)64.

The main strength of our TBI-GAN method\nis that it can generate TBI images and corresponding label maps simultaneously,\nwhich has not been achieved in the previous inpainting methods for medical\nimages. We first generate the inpainted image under the guidance of edge\ninformation following a coarse-to-fine manner, and then the synthesized\nintensity image is used as the prior for label inpainting. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a registration-based template augmentation pipeline to increase the\ndiversity of the synthesized image pairs and enhance the capacity of data\naugmentation.

This paper proposes Mass-AI-Scope (MAIScope): a novel,\nlow-cost, portable device that can take microscopic images and automatically\ndetect malaria parasites with embedded AI. The device has two subsystems. The\nfirst subsystem is an on-device multi-layered deep learning network, that\ndetects red blood cells (RBCs) from microscopic images, followed by a malaria\nparasite classifier that recognizes malaria parasites in the individual RBCs.\nThe testing and validation demonstrated a high average accuracy of 89.9% for\nclassification and average precision of 61.5% for detection models using\nTensorFlow Lite while addressing limited storage and computational capacity.\nThis system also has cloud synchronization, which sends images to the cloud\nwhen connected to the Internet for analysis and model improvement purposes. The\nsecond subsystem is the hardware which consists of components like Raspberry\nPi, a camera, a touch screen display, and an innovative low-cost bead\nmicroscope. Evaluation of the bead microscope demonstrated similar image\nquality with that of expensive light microscopes. The device is designed to be\nportable and work in remote environments without the Internet or power.

Thanks to these features, the MED can be used in quantum machine\nlearning tasks, such as clustering quantum measurement devices based on their\nmutual compatibility. We demonstrate this application by providing an\nunsupervised algorithm that clusters unknown von Neumann measurements. Our\nalgorithm is robust to noise can be used to identify groups of observers that\nshare approximately the same measurement context.",

    "title": "Unifying Gradients to Improve Real-world Robustness for Deep Networks",
    "abstract": "The wide application of deep neural networks (DNNs) demands an increasing\namount of attention to their real-world robustness, i.e., whether a DNN resists\nblack-box adversarial attacks, among them score-based query attacks (SQAs) are\nthe most threatening ones because of their practicalities and effectiveness:\nthe attackers only need dozens of queries on model outputs to seriously hurt a\nvictim network. Defending against SQAs requires a slight but artful variation\nof outputs due to the service purpose for users, who share the same output\ninformation with attackers. In this paper, we propose a real-world defense,\ncalled Unifying Gradients (UniG), to unify gradients of different data so that\nattackers could only probe a much weaker attack direction that is similar for\ndifferent samples. Since such universal attack perturbations have been\nvalidated as less aggressive than the input-specific perturbations, UniG\nprotects real-world DNNs by indicating attackers a twisted and less informative\nattack direction. To enhance UniG's practical significance in real-world\napplications, we implement it as a Hadamard product module that is\ncomputationally-efficient and readily plugged into any model. According to\nextensive experiments on 5 SQAs and 4 defense baselines, UniG significantly\nimproves real-world robustness without hurting clean accuracy on CIFAR10 and\nImageNet. For instance, UniG maintains a CIFAR-10 model of 77.80% accuracy\nunder 2500-query Square attack while the state-of-the-art adversarially-trained\nmodel only has 67.34% on CIFAR10. Simultaneously, UniG greatly surpasses all\ncompared baselines in clean accuracy and the modification degree of outputs.\nThe code would be released.",

Here, the\nchoice of data augmentation is sensitive to the quality of learned\nrepresentations: as harder the data augmentations are applied, the views share\nmore task-relevant information, but also task-irrelevant one that can hinder\nthe generalization capability of representation. Motivated by this, we present\na new robust contrastive learning scheme, coined R\\'enyiCL, which can\neffectively manage harder augmentations by utilizing R\\'enyi divergence. Our\nmethod is built upon the variational lower bound of R\\'enyi divergence, but a\nna\\\"ive usage of a variational method is impractical due to the large variance.\nTo tackle this challenge, we propose a novel contrastive objective that\nconducts variational estimation of a skew R\\'enyi divergence and provide a\ntheoretical guarantee on how variational estimation of skew divergence leads to\nstable training. We show that R\\'enyi contrastive learning objectives perform\ninnate hard negative sampling and easy positive sampling simultaneously so that\nit can selectively learn useful features and ignore nuisance features. Through\nexperiments on ImageNet, we show that R\\'enyi contrastive learning with\nstronger augmentations outperforms other self-supervised methods without extra\nregularization or computational overhead.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models, e.g. supervised Encoder-Decoder style networks, exhibit\npromising performance in medical image segmentation, but come with a high\nlabelling cost. We propose TriSegNet, a semi-supervised semantic segmentation\nframework. It uses triple-view feature learning on a limited amount of labelled\ndata and a large amount of unlabeled data. The triple-view architecture\nconsists of three pixel-level classifiers and a low-level shared-weight\nlearning module. The model is first initialized with labelled data. Label\nprocessing, including data perturbation, confidence label voting and\nunconfident label detection for annotation, enables the model to train on\nlabelled and unlabeled data simultaneously. The confidence of each model gets\nimproved through the other two views of the feature learning. This process is\nrepeated until each model reaches the same confidence level as its\ncounterparts. This strategy enables triple-view learning of generic medical\nimage datasets. Bespoke overlap-based and boundary-based loss functions are\ntailored to the different stages of the training. The segmentation results are\nevaluated on four publicly available benchmark datasets including Ultrasound,\nCT, MRI, and Histology images.

In this study, we want to\nexplore the relationship and dependency between EEG and language, i.e., how one\ndomain reflects and represents the other. To study the relationship at the\nrepresentation level, we introduced MTAM, a Multimodal Transformer Alignment\nModel, to observe coordinated representations between the two modalities, and\nthus employ the transformed representations for downstream applications. We\nused various relationship alignment-seeking techniques, such as Canonical\nCorrelation Analysis and Wasserstein Distance, as loss functions to transfigure\nlow-level language and EEG features to high-level transformed features.

However, overall accuracy in\npredicting lung tumor is low and the processing time is high as the error\noccurred while reconstructing the CT image. The aim of this work is to increase\nthe overall prediction accuracy along with reducing processing time by using\nmultispace image in pooling layer of convolution neural network. Methodology:\nThe proposed method has the autoencoder system to improve the overall accuracy,\nand to predict lung cancer by using multispace image in pooling layer of\nconvolution neural network and Adam Algorithm for optimization. First, the CT\nimages were pre-processed by feeding image to the convolution filter and down\nsampled by using max pooling. Then, features are extracted using the\nautoencoder model based on convolutional neural network and multispace image\nreconstruction technique is used to reduce error while reconstructing the image\nwhich then results improved accuracy to predict lung nodule. Finally, the\nreconstructed images are taken as input for SoftMax classifier to classify the\nCT images. Results: The state-of-art and proposed solutions were processed in\nPython Tensor Flow and It provides significant increase in accuracy in\nclassification of lung cancer to 99.5 from 98.9 and decrease in processing time\nfrom 10 frames/second to 12 seconds/second.

This learning\nmethod is in the spotlight in the drug field, lacking annotated data due to\ntime-consuming and expensive experiments. SSL using enormous unlabeled data has\nshown excellent performance for molecular property prediction, but a few issues\nexist. (1) Existing SSL models are large-scale; there is a limitation to\nimplementing SSL where the computing resource is insufficient. (2) In most\ncases, they do not utilize 3D structural information for molecular\nrepresentation learning. The activity of a drug is closely related to the\nstructure of the drug molecule.

We propose a novel contrastive learning framework,\nsmall-scale 3D Graph Contrastive Learning (3DGCL) for molecular property\nprediction, to solve the above problems. 3DGCL learns the molecular\nrepresentation by reflecting the molecule's structure through the pre-training\nprocess that does not change the semantics of the drug.

    "title": "Hybrid Approach to Identify Druglikeness Leading Compounds against SARS  3CL Protease",
    "abstract": "SARS-COV-2 is a positive single strand RNA based macromolecule that has\ncaused the death of more than 6.3 million people since June 2022. Moreover, by\ndisturbing global supply chains through lockdown, the virus has indirectly\ncaused devastating damage to the global economy. It is vital to design and\ndevelop drugs for this virus and its various variants. In this paper, we have\nused an In-Silico study framework to repurpose existing therapeutic agents to\nfind drug-like bioactive molecules that could cure Covid-19. We used the\nLipinski rules on the molecules retrieved from ChEMBL database to find 133\ndrug-likeness bioactive molecules against SARS coronavirus 3CL Protease. On the\nbasis of standard IC50, the dataset was divided into three classes of active,\ninactive and intermediate. Our comparative analysis demonstrated that proposed\nExtra Tree Regressor (ETR) ensemble model has improved results while predicting\naccurate bioactivity of chemical compound relative to other state-of-the-art\nmachine learning models. Using ADMET analysis, we identified 13 novel bioactive\nmolecules having ChEMBL IDs 187460, 190743, 222234, 222628, 222735, 222769,\n222840, 222893, 225515, 358279, 363535, 365134 and 426898. We found that these\nmolecules are highly suitable drug candidates for SARS-COV-2 3CL Protease.\nThese candidate molecules are further investigated for binding affinities. For\nthis purpose, we performed molecular docking and short listed six bioactive\nmolecules having ChEMBL IDs 187460, 222769, 225515, 358279, 363535, and 365134.\nThese molecules can be suitable drug candidates for SARS-COV-2. It is\nanticipated that pharmacologist community may use these promising compounds for\nfurther vitro analysis.",

    "abstract": "Herein, the Hidden Markov Model is expanded to allow for Markov chain\nobservations. In particular, the observations are assumed to be a Markov chain\nwhose one step transition probabilities depend upon the hidden Markov chain. An\nExpectation-Maximization analog to the Baum-Welch algorithm is developed for\nthis more general model to estimate the transition probabilities for both the\nhidden state and for the observations as well as to estimate the probabilities\nfor the initial joint hidden-state-observation distribution. A believe state or\nfilter recursion to track the hidden state then arises from the calculations of\nthis Expectation-Maximization algorithm. A dynamic programming analog to the\nViterbi algorithm is also developed to estimate the most likely sequence of\nhidden states given the sequence of observations.",

    "abstract": "Complex systems, such as the power grid, are essential for our daily lives.\nMany complex systems display (multi-)fractal behavior, correlated fluctuations\nand power laws. Whether the power-grid frequency, an indicator about the\nbalance on supply and demand in the electricity grid, also displays such\ncomplexity remains a mostly open question. Within the present article, we\nutilize highly resolved measurements to quantify the properties of the\npower-grid frequency. We show that below 1 second, the dynamics may\nfundamentally change, including a suddenly increasing power spectral density,\nemergence of multifractality and a change of correlation behavior. We provide a\nsimplified stochastic model involving positively correlated noise to reproduce\nthe observed dynamics, possibly linked to frequency dependent loads. Finally,\nwe stress the need for high-quality measurements and discuss how we obtained\nthe data analyzed here.",

    "title": "Layers, Folds, and Semi-Neuronal Information Processing",
    "abstract": "What role does phenotypic complexity play in the systems-level function of an\nembodied agent? The organismal phenotype is a topologically complex structure\nthat interacts with a genotype, developmental physics, and an informational\nenvironment. Using this observation as inspiration, we utilize a type of\nembodied agent that exhibits layered representational capacity: meta-brain\nmodels. Meta-brains are used to demonstrate how phenotypes process information\nand exhibit self-regulation from development to maturity. We focus on two\ncandidate structures that potentially explain this capacity: folding and\nlayering. As layering and folding can be observed in a host of biological\ncontexts, they form the basis for our representational investigations. First,\nan innate starting point (genomic encoding) is described. The generative output\nof this encoding is a differentiation tree, which results in a layered\nphenotypic representation. Then we specify a formal meta-brain model of the\ngut, which exhibits folding and layering in development in addition to\ndifferent degrees of representation of processed information. This organ\ntopology is retained in maturity, with the potential for additional folding and\nrepresentational drift in response to inflammation. Next, we consider\ntopological remapping using the developmental Braitenberg Vehicle (dBV) as a\ntoy model. During topological remapping, it is shown that folding of a layered\nneural network can introduce a number of distortions to the original model,\nsome with functional implications. The paper concludes with a discussion on how\nthe meta-brains method can assist us in the investigation of enactivism,\nholism, and cognitive processing in the context of biological simulation.",

    "title": "Ensembles of Realistic Power Distribution Networks",
    "abstract": "The power grid is going through significant changes with the introduction of\nrenewable energy sources and incorporation of smart grid technologies. These\nrapid advancements necessitate new models and analyses to keep up with the\nvarious emergent phenomena they induce. A major prerequisite of such work is\nthe acquisition of well-constructed and accurate network datasets for the power\ngrid infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a robust, scalable framework to\nsynthesize power distribution networks which resemble their physical\ncounterparts for a given region. We use openly available information about\ninterdependent road and building infrastructures to construct the networks. In\ncontrast to prior work based on network statistics, we incorporate engineering\nand economic constraints to create the networks. Additionally, we provide a\nframework to create ensembles of power distribution networks to generate\nmultiple possible instances of the network for a given region. The\ncomprehensive dataset consists of nodes with attributes such as\ngeo-coordinates, type of node (residence, transformer, or substation), and\nedges with attributes such as geometry, type of line (feeder lines, primary or\nsecondary) and line parameters. For validation, we provide detailed comparisons\nof the generated networks with actual distribution networks. The generated\ndatasets represent realistic test systems (as compared to standard IEEE test\ncases) that can be used by network scientists to analyze complex events in\npower grids and to perform detailed sensitivity and statistical analyses over\nensembles of networks.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised learning of latent variable models (LVMs) is widely used to\nrepresent data in machine learning. When such models reflect the ground truth\nfactors and the mechanisms mapping them to observations, there is reason to\nexpect that they allow generalization in downstream tasks. It is however well\nknown that such identifiability guaranties are typically not achievable without\nputting constraints on the model class. This is notably the case for nonlinear\nIndependent Component Analysis, in which the LVM maps statistically independent\nvariables to observations via a deterministic nonlinear function. Several\nfamilies of spurious solutions fitting perfectly the data, but that do not\ncorrespond to the ground truth factors can be constructed in generic settings.\nHowever, recent work suggests that constraining the function class of such\nmodels may promote identifiability. Specifically, function classes with\nconstraints on their partial derivatives, gathered in the Jacobian matrix, have\nbeen proposed, such as orthogonal coordinate transformations (OCT), which\nimpose orthogonality of the Jacobian columns. In the present work, we prove\nthat a subclass of these transformations, conformal maps, is identifiable and\nprovide novel theoretical results suggesting that OCTs have properties that\nprevent families of spurious solutions to spoil identifiability in a generic\nsetting.",
