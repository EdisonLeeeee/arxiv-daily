    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication is becoming critical for the\nenhanced reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the uncertainties\nin the road-traffic and AVs' wireless connections can severely impair timely\ndecision-making. It is thus critical to simultaneously optimize the AVs'\nnetwork selection and driving policies in order to minimize road collisions\nwhile maximizing the communication data rates. In this paper, we develop a\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework to characterize efficient network\nselection and autonomous driving policies in a multi-band vehicular network\n(VNet) operating on conventional sub-6GHz spectrum and Terahertz (THz)\nfrequencies. The proposed framework is designed to (i) maximize the traffic\nflow and minimize collisions by controlling the vehicle's motion dynamics\n(i.e., speed and acceleration) from autonomous driving perspective, and (ii)\nmaximize the data rates and minimize handoffs by jointly controlling the\nvehicle's motion dynamics and network selection from telecommunication\nperspective. We cast this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and\ndevelop a deep Q-learning based solution to optimize the actions such as\nacceleration, deceleration, lane-changes, and AV-base station assignments for a\ngiven AV's state. The AV's state is defined based on the velocities and\ncommunication channel states of AVs. Numerical results demonstrate interesting\ninsights related to the inter-dependency of vehicle's motion dynamics,\nhandoffs, and the communication data rate. The proposed policies enable AVs to\nadopt safe driving behaviors with improved connectivity.",

In past few years, there are a lot of\nworks on adversarial examples attacks against ASR systems. By adding a small\nperturbation to the waveforms, the recognition results make a big difference.\nIn this paper, we describe the development of ASR system, different assumptions\nof attacks, and how to evaluate these attacks. Next, we introduce the current\nworks on adversarial examples attacks from two attack assumptions: white-box\nattack and black-box attack. Different from other surveys, we pay more\nattention to which layer they perturb waveforms in ASR system, the relationship\nbetween these attacks, and their implementation methods.

Nonetheless, when the scale of a\nphotonic circuit increases, the effects of noise on the fidelity of quantum\noperators and deep learning weight matrices become more severe. Here we\ndemonstrate a nontrivial stochastic nature of large-scale programmable photonic\ncircuits-heavy-tailed distributions of rotation operators-that enables the\ndevelopment of high-fidelity universal unitaries through designed pruning of\nsuperfluous rotations. The power law and the Pareto principle for the\nconventional architecture of programmable photonic circuits are revealed with\nthe presence of hub phase shifters, allowing for the application of network\npruning to the design of photonic hardware. We extract a universal architecture\nfor pruning random unitary matrices and prove that \"the bad is sometimes better\nto be removed\" to achieve high fidelity and energy efficiency.

These challenges\ncan be addressed through efficient implementations of Spiking Neural Networks\n(SNNs) on Neuromorphic Chips and the use of event-based cameras instead of\ntraditional frame-based cameras.\nIn this paper, we present a new SNN-based approach, called LaneSNN, for\ndetecting the lanes marked on the streets using the event-based camera input.\nWe develop four novel SNN models characterized by low complexity and fast\nresponse, and train them using an offline supervised learning rule.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has attracted growing interest for enabling\nprivacy-preserving machine learning on data stored at multiple users while\navoiding moving the data off-device. However, while data never leaves users'\ndevices, privacy still cannot be guaranteed since significant computations on\nusers' training data are shared in the form of trained local models. These\nlocal models have recently been shown to pose a substantial privacy threat\nthrough different privacy attacks such as model inversion attacks. As a remedy,\nSecure Aggregation (SA) has been developed as a framework to preserve privacy\nin FL, by guaranteeing the server can only learn the global aggregated model\nupdate but not the individual model updates. While SA ensures no additional\ninformation is leaked about the individual model update beyond the aggregated\nmodel update, there are no formal guarantees on how much privacy FL with SA can\nactually offer; as information about the individual dataset can still\npotentially leak through the aggregated model computed at the server. In this\nwork, we perform a first analysis of the formal privacy guarantees for FL with\nSA. Specifically, we use Mutual Information (MI) as a quantification metric and\nderive upper bounds on how much information about each user's dataset can leak\nthrough the aggregated model update. When using the FedSGD aggregation\nalgorithm, our theoretical bounds show that the amount of privacy leakage\nreduces linearly with the number of users participating in FL with SA. To\nvalidate our theoretical bounds, we use an MI Neural Estimator to empirically\nevaluate the privacy leakage under different FL setups on both the MNIST and\nCIFAR10 datasets. Our experiments verify our theoretical bounds for FedSGD,\nwhich show a reduction in privacy leakage as the number of users and local\nbatch size grow, and an increase in privacy leakage with the number of training\nrounds.",

    "abstract": "In the field, robots often need to operate in unknown and unstructured\nenvironments, where accurate sensing and state estimation (SE) becomes a major\nchallenge. Cameras have been used to great success in mapping and planning in\nsuch environments, as well as complex but quasi-static tasks such as grasping,\nbut are rarely integrated into the control loop for unstable systems. Learning\npixel-to-torque control promises to allow robots to flexibly handle a wider\nvariety of tasks. Although they do not present additional theoretical\nobstacles, learning pixel-to-torque control for unstable systems that that\nrequire precise and high bandwidth control still poses a significant practical\nchallenge, and best practices have not yet been established. To help drive\nreproducible research on the practical aspects of learning pixel-to-torque\ncontrol, we propose a platform that can flexibly represent the entire process,\nfrom lab to deployment, for learning pixel-to-torque control on a robot with\nfast, unstable dynamics: the vision-based Furuta pendulum. The platform can be\nreproduced with either off-the-shelf or custom-built hardware. We expect that\nthis platform will allow researchers to quickly and systematically test\ndifferent approaches, as well as reproduce and benchmark case studies from\nother labs. We also present a first case study on this system using DNNs which,\nto the best of our knowledge, is the first demonstration of learning\npixel-to-torque control on an unstable system with update rates faster than 100\nHz.

    "abstract": "Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of harmful algal\nblooms (HABs), which cause significant fish deaths in aquaculture farms. This\ncontributes to ocean pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions since dead\nfish are either dumped into the ocean or taken to landfills, which in turn\nnegatively impacts the climate. Currently, the standard method to enumerate\nharmful algae and other phytoplankton is to manually observe and count them\nunder a microscope. This is a time-consuming, tedious and error-prone process,\nresulting in compromised management decisions by farmers. Hence, automating\nthis process for quick and accurate HAB monitoring is extremely helpful.\nHowever, this requires large and diverse datasets of phytoplankton images, and\nsuch datasets are hard to produce quickly. In this work, we explore the\nfeasibility of generating novel high-resolution photorealistic synthetic\nphytoplankton images, containing multiple species in the same image, given a\nsmall dataset of real images. To this end, we employ Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs) to generate synthetic images. We evaluate three different GAN\narchitectures: ProjectedGAN, FastGAN, and StyleGANv2 using standard image\nquality metrics. We empirically show the generation of high-fidelity synthetic\nphytoplankton images using a training dataset of only 961 real images. Thus,\nthis work demonstrates the ability of GANs to create large synthetic datasets\nof phytoplankton from small training datasets, accomplishing a key step towards\nsustainable systematic monitoring of harmful algal blooms.",

    "abstract": "Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), insurers cannot engage in medical\nunderwriting and thus face perverse incentives to engage in risk selection and\ndiscourage low-value patients from enrolling in their plans. One ACA program\nintended to reduce the effects of risk selection is risk adjustment. Under a\nrisk adjustment program, insurers with less healthy enrollees receive risk\ntransfer payments from insurers with healthier enrollees. Our goal is to\nunderstand the elements driving risk transfers. First, the distribution of risk\ntransfers should be based on random health shocks, which are unpredictable\nevents that negatively affect health status. Second, risk transfers could be\ninfluenced by factors unique to each insurer, such as certain plans attracting\ncertain patients, the extent to which carriers engage in risk selection, and\nthe degree of upcoding. We create a publicly available dataset using Centers\nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services data that includes insurer risk transfer\npayments, costs, and premiums for the 2014-2017 benefit years. Using this\ndataset, we find that the empirical distribution of risk transfer payments is\nnot consistent with the lack of risk selection as measured by the ACA risk\ntransfer formula. Over all states included in our dataset, at least 60% of the\nvolume of transfers cannot be accounted for by a purely normal model. Because\nwe find that it is very unlikely that risk transfer payments are caused solely\nby random shocks that reflect health events of the population, our work raises\nimportant questions about the causes of heterogeneity in risk transfers.",

    "title": "AACC: Asymmetric Actor-Critic in Contextual Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques have drawn great attention in many\nchallenging tasks, but their performance deteriorates dramatically when applied\nto real-world problems. Various methods, such as domain randomization, have\nbeen proposed to deal with such situations by training agents under different\nenvironmental setups, and therefore they can be generalized to different\nenvironments during deployment. However, they usually do not incorporate the\nunderlying environmental factor information that the agents interact with\nproperly and thus can be overly conservative when facing changes in the\nsurroundings. In this paper, we first formalize the task of adapting to\nchanging environmental dynamics in RL as a generalization problem using\nContextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs). We then propose the Asymmetric\nActor-Critic in Contextual RL (AACC) as an end-to-end actor-critic method to\ndeal with such generalization tasks. We demonstrate the essential improvements\nin the performance of AACC over existing baselines experimentally in a range of\nsimulated environments.",

    "abstract": "Meta-Learning algorithms for few-shot learning aim to train neural networks\ncapable of generalizing to novel tasks using only a few examples.\nEarly-stopping is critical for performance, halting model training when it\nreaches optimal generalization to the new task distribution. Early-stopping\nmechanisms in Meta-Learning typically rely on measuring the model performance\non labeled examples from a meta-validation set drawn from the training (source)\ndataset. This is problematic in few-shot transfer learning settings, where the\nmeta-test set comes from a different target dataset (OOD) and can potentially\nhave a large distributional shift with the meta-validation set. In this work,\nwe propose Activation Based Early-stopping (ABE), an alternative to using\nvalidation-based early-stopping for meta-learning. Specifically, we analyze the\nevolution, during meta-training, of the neural activations at each hidden\nlayer, on a small set of unlabelled support examples from a single task of the\ntarget tasks distribution, as this constitutes a minimal and justifiably\naccessible information from the target problem. Our experiments show that\nsimple, label agnostic statistics on the activations offer an effective way to\nestimate how the target generalization evolves over time. At each hidden layer,\nwe characterize the activation distributions, from their first and second order\nmoments, then further summarized along the feature dimensions, resulting in a\ncompact yet intuitive characterization in a four-dimensional space. Detecting\nwhen, throughout training time, and at which layer, the target activation\ntrajectory diverges from the activation trajectory of the source data, allows\nus to perform early-stopping and improve generalization in a large array of\nfew-shot transfer learning settings, across different algorithms, source and\ntarget datasets.",

In\nparticular, gender is a characteristic that is related to human identification,\nso that virtual humans assigned to a specific gender have, in general,\nstereotyped representations through movements, clothes, hair and colors, in\norder to be understood by users as desired by designers. An important area of\nstudy is finding out whether participants' perceptions change depending on how\na virtual human is visually presented. Findings in this area can help the\nindustry to guide the modeling and animation of virtual humans to deliver the\nexpected impact to the audience. In this paper, we reproduce, through CG, a\nperceptual study that aims to assess gender bias in relation to a simulated\nbaby. In the original study, two groups of people watched the same video of a\nbaby reacting to the same stimuli, but one group was told the baby was female\nand the other group was told the same baby was male, producing different\nperceptions. The results of our study with virtual babies were similar to the\nfindings with real babies.

However, yield\nestimation is currently performed using manual sampling, which is\ntime-consuming and imprecise. This study demonstrates the application of\nproximal imaging combined with deep learning for yield estimation in vineyards.\nContinuous data collection using a vehicle-mounted sensing kit combined with\ncollection of ground truth yield data at harvest using a commercial yield\nmonitor allowed for the generation of a large dataset of 23,581 yield points\nand 107,933 images. Moreover, this study was conducted in a mechanically\nmanaged commercial vineyard, representing a challenging environment for image\nanalysis but a common set of conditions in the California Central Valley. Three\nmodel architectures were tested: object detection, CNN regression, and\ntransformer models. The object detection model was trained on hand-labeled\nimages to localize grape bunches, and either bunch count or pixel area was\nsummed to correlate with grape yield. Conversely, regression models were\ntrained end-to-end to predict grape yield from image data without the need for\nhand labeling. Results demonstrated that both a transformer as well as the\nobject detection model with pixel area processing performed comparably, with a\nmean absolute percent error of 18% and 18.5%, respectively on a representative\nholdout dataset.

    "abstract": "We study multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with centralized training\nand decentralized execution. During the training, new agents may join, and\nexisting agents may unexpectedly leave the training. In such situations, a\nstandard deep MARL model must be trained again from scratch, which is very\ntime-consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose a special network\narchitecture with a few-shot learning algorithm that allows the number of\nagents to vary during centralized training. In particular, when a new agent\njoins the centralized training, our few-shot learning algorithm trains its\npolicy network and value network using a small number of samples; when an agent\nleaves the training, the training process of the remaining agents is not\naffected. Our experiments show that using the proposed network architecture and\nalgorithm, model adaptation when new agents join can be 100+ times faster than\nthe baseline. Our work is applicable to any setting, including cooperative,\ncompetitive, and mixed.",

    "abstract": "Identifying pills given their captured images under various conditions and\nbackgrounds has been becoming more and more essential. Several efforts have\nbeen devoted to utilizing the deep learning-based approach to tackle the pill\nrecognition problem in the literature. However, due to the high similarity\nbetween pills' appearance, misrecognition often occurs, leaving pill\nrecognition a challenge. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a novel\napproach named PIKA that leverages external knowledge to enhance pill\nrecognition accuracy. Specifically, we address a practical scenario (which we\ncall contextual pill recognition), aiming to identify pills in a picture of a\npatient's pill intake. Firstly, we propose a novel method for modeling the\nimplicit association between pills in the presence of an external data source,\nin this case, prescriptions. Secondly, we present a walk-based graph embedding\nmodel that transforms from the graph space to vector space and extracts\ncondensed relational features of the pills. Thirdly, a final framework is\nprovided that leverages both image-based visual and graph-based relational\nfeatures to accomplish the pill identification task. Within this framework, the\nvisual representation of each pill is mapped to the graph embedding space,\nwhich is then used to execute attention over the graph representation,\nresulting in a semantically-rich context vector that aids in the final\nclassification. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use external\nprescription data to establish associations between medicines and to classify\nthem using this aiding information. The architecture of PIKA is lightweight and\nhas the flexibility to incorporate into any recognition backbones. The\nexperimental results show that by leveraging the external knowledge graph, PIKA\ncan improve the recognition accuracy from 4.8% to 34.1% in terms of F1-score,\ncompared to baselines.",

    "abstract": "Traditional model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods generate forward\nrollout traces using the learnt dynamics model to reduce interactions with the\nreal environment. The recent model-based RL method considers the way to learn a\nbackward model that specifies the conditional probability of the previous state\ngiven the previous action and the current state to additionally generate\nbackward rollout trajectories. However, in this type of model-based method, the\nsamples derived from backward rollouts and those from forward rollouts are\nsimply aggregated together to optimize the policy via the model-free RL\nalgorithm, which may decrease both the sample efficiency and the convergence\nrate. This is because such an approach ignores the fact that backward rollout\ntraces are often generated starting from some high-value states and are\ncertainly more instructive for the agent to improve the behavior. In this\npaper, we propose the backward imitation and forward reinforcement learning\n(BIFRL) framework where the agent treats backward rollout traces as expert\ndemonstrations for the imitation of excellent behaviors, and then collects\nforward rollout transitions for policy reinforcement. Consequently, BIFRL\nempowers the agent to both reach to and explore from high-value states in a\nmore efficient manner, and further reduces the real interactions, making it\npotentially more suitable for real-robot learning. Moreover, a\nvalue-regularized generative adversarial network is introduced to augment the\nvaluable states which are infrequently received by the agent. Theoretically, we\nprovide the condition where BIFRL is superior to the baseline methods.\nExperimentally, we demonstrate that BIFRL acquires the better sample efficiency\nand produces the competitive asymptotic performance on various MuJoCo\nlocomotion tasks compared against state-of-the-art model-based methods.",

Current approaches\ngenerally use exact and heuristic algorithms to solve the problem, while the\ncomputation time rapidly increases as the task scale grows and heuristic rules\nneed manual design. As a self-learning method, DRL can obtain a high-quality\nsolution quickly without hand-engineered rules. However, the huge decision\nspace makes the training of DRL models becomes unstable in situations with\nlarge-scale tasks. In this work, to address the large-scale problem, we develop\na divide and conquer-based framework (DCF) to decouple the original problem\ninto a task allocation and a UAV route planning subproblems, which are solved\nin the upper and lower layers, respectively. Based on DCF, a double-layer deep\nreinforcement learning approach (DL-DRL) is proposed, where an upper-layer DRL\nmodel is designed to allocate tasks to appropriate UAVs and a lower-layer DRL\nmodel [i.e., the widely used attention model (AM)] is applied to generate\nviable UAV routes. Since the upper-layer model determines the input data\ndistribution of the lower-layer model, and its reward is calculated via the\nlower-layer model during training, we develop an interactive training strategy\n(ITS), where the whole training process consists of pre-training, intensive\ntraining, and alternate training processes. Experimental results show that our\nDL-DRL outperforms mainstream learning-based and most traditional methods, and\nis competitive with the state-of-the-art heuristic method [i.e., OR-Tools],\nespecially on large-scale problems. The great generalizability of DL-DRL is\nalso verified by testing the model learned for a problem size to larger ones.\nFurthermore, an ablation study demonstrates that our ITS can reach a compromise\nbetween the model performance and training duration.",

In recent years, multi-exposure fusion\nmethods have achieved remarkable results, which merge multiple low dynamic\nrange (LDR) images, captured with different exposures, to generate\ncorresponding HDR images. However, synthesizing HDR images in dynamic scenes is\nstill challenging and in high demand. There are two challenges in producing HDR\nimages: 1). Object motion between LDR images can easily cause undesirable\nghosting artifacts in the generated results. 2). Under and overexposed regions\noften contain distorted image content, because of insufficient compensation for\nthese regions in the merging stage. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale\nsampling and aggregation network for HDR imaging in dynamic scenes. To\neffectively alleviate the problems caused by small and large motions, our\nmethod implicitly aligns LDR images by sampling and aggregating\nhigh-correspondence features in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore, we\npropose a densely connected network based on discrete wavelet transform for\nperformance improvement, which decomposes the input into several\nnon-overlapping frequency subbands and adaptively performs compensation in the\nwavelet domain. Experiments show that our proposed method can achieve\nstate-of-the-art performances under diverse scenes, compared to other promising\nHDR imaging methods.

    "abstract": "Guided by the Persuasion Knowledge Model and the Attribution Theory, this\nstudy investigates the perceived source expertise-product attribute congruence\nand sponsorship disclosure as pertinent factors affecting the communicative\neffectiveness of influencers. Instagram, with an immense influencer market\nvalue projected at USD2.3 billion in 2020, was chosen as the platform context.\nThe study utilised a 2 (source expertise) x2 (product category) x2 (sponsorship\ndisclosure) experiment to examine the roles of source-product congruence and\nsponsorship disclosure in affecting consumers' perception of extrinsic and\nintrinsic source motives, consumer resistance and ultimately, advertising\neffectiveness. Results revealed that the presence of a sponsorship disclosure\ngenerated stronger perceptions of extrinsic source motives but did not impact\nconsumer resistance and advertising effectiveness, indicating that the\nactivation of consumers' conceptual persuasion knowledge may not necessarily\naffect attitudinal persuasion knowledge. Source-product congruence, on the\nother hand, had main impacts on intrinsic motives, consumer resistance and ad\neffectiveness. In addition, hierarchical multiple regressions found that\nsource-product congruence triggers a multi-stage process where consumers'\nperception of intrinsic source motives mediates consumer resistance which\nsubsequently, mediates the relationship between source-product congruence and\nad effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "The widespread use of smart computer vision systems in our personal spaces\nhas led to an increased consciousness about the privacy and security risks that\nthese systems pose. On the one hand, we want these systems to assist in our\ndaily lives by understanding their surroundings, but on the other hand, we want\nthem to do so without capturing any sensitive information. Towards this\ndirection, this paper proposes a simple, yet robust privacy-preserving encoder\ncalled BDQ for the task of privacy-preserving human action recognition that is\ncomposed of three modules: Blur, Difference, and Quantization. First, the input\nscene is passed to the Blur module to smoothen the edges. This is followed by\nthe Difference module to apply a pixel-wise intensity subtraction between\nconsecutive frames to highlight motion features and suppress obvious high-level\nprivacy attributes. Finally, the Quantization module is applied to the motion\ndifference frames to remove the low-level privacy attributes. The BDQ\nparameters are optimized in an end-to-end fashion via adversarial training such\nthat it learns to allow action recognition attributes while inhibiting privacy\nattributes. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed\nencoder design can achieve state-of-the-art trade-off when compared with\nprevious works. Furthermore, we show that the trade-off achieved is at par with\nthe DVS sensor-based event cameras. Code available at:\nhttps://github.com/suakaw/BDQ_PrivacyAR.",

Representations of dialogue states\nare dependent on the domain ontology and the user's goals.

The lack of such consideration limits the scalability of dialogue\nstate tracking models for dialogues having specific objectives and ontology. To\naddress this issue, we formulate and incorporate dialogue acts, and leverage\nrecent advances in machine reading comprehension to predict both categorical\nand non-categorical types of slots for multi-domain dialogue state tracking.\nExperimental results show that our models can improve the overall accuracy of\ndialogue state tracking on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset, and demonstrate that\nincorporating dialogue acts can guide dialogue state design for future\ntask-oriented dialogue systems.",

These methods solely consider the\ndistortion quality and ignore crucial requirements for online applications,\ne.g., low latency and low model complexity. In this paper, we focus on online\nvideo transmission, in which VSR algorithms are required to generate\nhigh-resolution video sequences frame by frame in real time. To address such\nchallenges, we propose an extremely low-latency VSR algorithm based on a novel\nkernel knowledge transfer method, named convolutional kernel bypass graft\n(CKBG). First, we design a lightweight network structure that does not require\nfuture frames as inputs and saves extra time costs for caching these frames.\nThen, our proposed CKBG method enhances this lightweight base model by\nbypassing the original network with ``kernel grafts'', which are extra\nconvolutional kernels containing the prior knowledge of external pretrained\nimage SR models. In the testing phase, we further accelerate the grafted\nmulti-branch network by converting it into a simple single-path structure.\nExperiment results show that our proposed method can process online video\nsequences up to 110 FPS, with very low model complexity and competitive SR\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Since most of vehicular radar systems are already exploiting millimeter-wave\n(mmWave) spectra, it would become much more feasible to implement a joint radar\nand communication system by extending communication frequencies into the mmWave\nband. In this paper, an IEEE 802.11ad waveform-based radar imaging technique is\nproposed for vehicular settings. A roadside unit (RSU) transmits the IEEE\n802.11ad waveform to a vehicle for communications while the RSU also listens to\nthe echoes of transmitted waveform to perform inverse synthetic aperture radar\n(ISAR) imaging. To obtain high-resolution images of the vehicle, the RSU needs\nto accurately estimate round-trip delays, Doppler shifts, and velocity of\nvehicle. The proposed ISAR imaging first estimates the round-trip delays using\na good correlation property of Golay complementary sequences in the IEEE\n802.11ad preamble. The Doppler shifts are then obtained using least square\nestimation from the echo signals and refined to compensate phase wrapping\ncaused by phase rotation. The velocity of vehicle is determined using an\nequation of motion and the estimated Doppler shifts. Simulation results verify\nthat the proposed technique is able to form high-resolution ISAR images from\npoint scatterer models of realistic vehicular settings with different\nviewpoints. The proposed ISAR imaging technique can be used for various\nvehicular applications, e.g., traffic condition analyses or advanced collision\nwarning systems.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a new efficient and robust method for rare event\nprobability estimation for computational models of an engineering product or a\nprocess returning categorical information only, for example, either success or\nfailure. For such models, most of the methods designed for the estimation of\nfailure probability, which use the numerical value of the outcome to compute\ngradients or to estimate the proximity to the failure surface, cannot be\napplied. Even if the performance function provides more than just binary\noutput, the state of the system may be a non-smooth or even a discontinuous\nfunction defined in the domain of continuous input variables. In these cases,\nthe classical gradient-based methods usually fail. We propose a simple yet\nefficient algorithm, which performs a sequential adaptive selection of points\nfrom the input domain of random variables to extend and refine a simple\ndistance-based surrogate model. Two different tasks can be accomplished at any\nstage of sequential sampling: (i) estimation of the failure probability, and\n(ii) selection of the best possible candidate for the subsequent model\nevaluation if further improvement is necessary. The proposed criterion for\nselecting the next point for model evaluation maximizes the expected\nprobability classified by using the candidate. Therefore, the perfect balance\nbetween global exploration and local exploitation is maintained automatically.\nThe method can estimate the probabilities of multiple failure types. Moreover,\nwhen the numerical value of model evaluation can be used to build a smooth\nsurrogate, the algorithm can accommodate this information to increase the\naccuracy of the estimated probabilities.

MmWave communication relies on highly directional\ntransmission, which significantly increase the training overhead for fine beam\nalignment. The concept of using out-of-band spatial information to aid mmWave\nbeam search is developed when multi-band systems operating in parallel. The\nfeasibility of leveraging low-band channel information for coarse estimation of\nhigh-band beam directions strongly depends on the spatial congruence between\ntwo frequency bands. In this paper, we try to provide insights into the answers\nof two important questions. First, how similar is the power angular spectra\n(PAS) of radio channels between two well-separated frequency bands? Then, what\nis the impact of practical system configurations on spatial channel similarity?\nSpecifically, the beam direction-based metric is proposed to measure the power\nloss and number of false directions if out-of-band spatial information is used\ninstead of in-band information. This metric is more practical and useful than\ncomparing normalized PAS directly.

Our rating tool assesses the apps' essential features, AI-based advanced\nfunctionalities, and software quality characteristics required for food\nconsumption tracking and recommendations, as well as their usefulness to\ngeneral users. Users' comments from the app stores are collected and evaluated\nto better understand their expectations and perspectives. Following an\nevaluation of the assessed applications, design considerations that emphasize\nautomation-based approaches using artificial intelligence are proposed.\nAccording to our assessment, most mobile apps in the app stores do not satisfy\nthe overall requirements for tracking food consumption and recommendations.\n\"Foodvisor\" is the only app that can automatically recognize food items, and\ncompute the recommended volume and nutritional information of that food item.\nHowever, these features need to be improvised in the food consumption tracking\nand recommendation apps. This study provides both researchers and developers\nwith an insight into current state-of-the-art apps and design guidelines with\nnecessary information on essential features and software quality\ncharacteristics for designing and developing a better app.",

To illustrate model capabilities, we\nsimulate a 400-day evolution of 200 drivers and 2000 travelers on a\nroad-network of Amsterdam. We design a six-stage market entry strategy with\nconsecutive: kick-off, discount, launch, growth, maturity and greed stages.\nAfter 25 days the platform offers discounts, yet it starts gaining market share\nonly when the marketing campaign launches at day 50. Campaign finishes after 50\ndays, which does not stop the growth, now fueled mainly with a positive word of\nmouth effect and experiences. The platform ends discounts after 200 days and\nreaches the steady maturity period, after which its greedy strategy leads to\ncollapse of its market share and profit. All above simulated with a single\nbehavioral model, which well reproduces how agents of both sides adapts to\nplatform actions.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has been postulated as a solution for numerous problems in\ndifferent branches of science. Given the resource-intensive nature of these\nmodels, they often need to be executed on specialized hardware such graphical\nprocessing units (GPUs) in a distributed manner. In the academic field,\nresearchers get access to this kind of resources through High Performance\nComputing (HPC) clusters. This kind of infrastructures make the training of\nthese models difficult due to their multi-user nature and limited user\npermission. In addition, different HPC clusters may possess different\npeculiarities that can entangle the research cycle (e.g., libraries\ndependencies). In this paper we develop a workflow and methodology for the\ndistributed training of deep learning models in HPC clusters which provides\nresearchers with a series of novel advantages. It relies on udocker as\ncontainerization tool and on Horovod as library for the distribution of the\nmodels across multiple GPUs. udocker does not need any special permission,\nallowing researchers to run the entire workflow without relying on any\nadministrator. Horovod ensures the efficient distribution of the training\nindependently of the deep learning framework used. Additionally, due to\ncontainerization and specific features of the workflow, it provides researchers\nwith a cluster-agnostic way of running their models. The experiments carried\nout show that the workflow offers good scalability in the distributed training\nof the models and that it easily adapts to different clusters.",

The number of feasible rides\ngrows with the number of travelers and the degree (capacity of the vehicle to\nperform a pooled ride) and quickly explodes to the sizes making the problem not\nsolvable analytically. In practice, heuristics are applied to limit the number\nof searches, e.g., maximal detour and delay, or (like we use in this study)\nattractive rides (for which detour and delay are at least compensated with the\ndiscount).\nNevertheless, the challenge to solve the ride-pooling remains strongly\nsensitive to the problem settings. Here, we explore it in more detail and\nprovide an experimental underpinning to this open research problem. We trace\nhow the size of the search space and computation time needed to solve the\nride-pooling problem grows with the increasing demand and greater discounts\noffered for pooling. We run over 100 practical experiments in Amsterdam with\n10-minute batches of trip requests up to 3600 trips per hour and trace how\nchallenging it is to propose the solution to the pooling problem with our ExMAS\nalgorithm.\nWe observed strong, non-linear trends and identified the limits beyond which\nthe problem exploded and our algorithm failed to compute.

    "abstract": "When the available hardware cannot meet the memory and compute requirements\nto efficiently train high performing machine learning models, a compromise in\neither the training quality or the model complexity is needed. In Federated\nLearning (FL), nodes are orders of magnitude more constrained than traditional\nserver-grade hardware and are often battery powered, severely limiting the\nsophistication of models that can be trained under this paradigm. While most\nresearch has focused on designing better aggregation strategies to improve\nconvergence rates and in alleviating the communication costs of FL, fewer\nefforts have been devoted to accelerating on-device training. Such stage, which\nrepeats hundreds of times (i.e. every round) and can involve thousands of\ndevices, accounts for the majority of the time required to train federated\nmodels and, the totality of the energy consumption at the client side. In this\nwork, we present the first study on the unique aspects that arise when\nintroducing sparsity at training time in FL workloads. We then propose ZeroFL,\na framework that relies on highly sparse operations to accelerate on-device\ntraining. Models trained with ZeroFL and 95% sparsity achieve up to 2.3% higher\naccuracy compared to competitive baselines obtained from adapting a\nstate-of-the-art sparse training framework to the FL setting.",

    "abstract": "Supervised deep learning algorithms hold great potential to automate\nscreening, monitoring and grading of medical images. However, training\nperformant models has typically required vast quantities of labelled data,\nwhich is scarcely available in the medical domain. Self-supervised contrastive\nframeworks relax this dependency by first learning from unlabelled images. In\nthis work we show that pretraining with two contrastive methods, SimCLR and\nBYOL, improves the utility of deep learning with regard to the clinical\nassessment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In experiments using two\nlarge clinical datasets containing 170,427 optical coherence tomography (OCT)\nimages of 7,912 patients, we evaluate benefits attributed to pretraining across\nseven downstream tasks ranging from AMD stage and type classification to\nprediction of functional endpoints to segmentation of retinal layers, finding\nperformance significantly increased in six out of seven tasks with fewer\nlabels. However, standard contrastive frameworks have two known weaknesses that\nare detrimental to pretraining in the medical domain. Several of the image\ntransformations used to create positive contrastive pairs are not applicable to\ngreyscale medical scans. Furthermore, medical images often depict the same\nanatomical region and disease severity, resulting in numerous misleading\nnegative pairs. To address these issues we develop a novel metadata-enhanced\napproach that exploits the rich set of inherently available patient\ninformation. To this end we employ records for patient identity, eye position\n(i.e. left or right) and time series data to indicate the typically unknowable\nset of inter-image contrastive relationships. By leveraging this often\nneglected information our metadata-enhanced contrastive pretraining leads to\nfurther benefits and outperforms conventional contrastive methods in five out\nof seven downstream tasks.",

    "abstract": "Text generative models trained via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) suffer\nfrom the notorious exposure bias problem, and Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs) are shown to have potential to tackle it. Existing language GANs adopt\nestimators like REINFORCE or continuous relaxations to model word\ndistributions. The inherent limitations of such estimators lead current models\nto rely on pre-training techniques (MLE pre-training or pre-trained\nembeddings). Representation modeling methods which are free from those\nlimitations, however, are seldom explored because of its poor performance in\nprevious attempts. Our analyses reveal that invalid sampling method and\nunhealthy gradients are the main contributors to its unsatisfactory\nperformance. In this work, we present two techniques to tackle these problems:\ndropout sampling and fully normalized LSTM. Based on these two techniques, we\npropose InitialGAN whose parameters are randomly initialized completely.\nBesides, we introduce a new evaluation metric, Least Coverage Rate, to better\nevaluate the quality of generated samples. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat InitialGAN outperforms both MLE and other compared models. To the best of\nour knowledge, it is the first time a language GAN can outperform MLE without\nany pre-training techniques.",

In this work, we explore the transfer of prompt tuning to\nmultimodal pretraining, with a focus on generative multimodal pretrained\nmodels, instead of contrastive ones. Specifically, we implement prompt tuning\non the unified sequence-to-sequence pretrained model adaptive to both\nunderstanding and generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nlight-weight prompt tuning can achieve comparable performance with finetuning\nand surpass other light-weight tuning methods. Besides, in comparison with\nfinetuned models, the prompt-tuned models demonstrate improved robustness\nagainst adversarial attacks. We further figure out that experimental factors,\nincluding the prompt length, prompt depth, and reparameteratization, have great\nimpacts on the model performance, and thus we empirically provide a\nrecommendation for the setups of prompt tuning.

    "abstract": "Feature representation learning is the key recipe for learning-based\nMulti-View Stereo (MVS). As the common feature extractor of learning-based MVS,\nvanilla Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) suffers from discouraged feature\nrepresentations for reflection and texture-less areas, which limits the\ngeneralization of MVS. Even FPNs worked with pre-trained Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) fail to tackle these issues. On the other hand, Vision\nTransformers (ViTs) have achieved prominent success in many 2D vision tasks.\nThus we ask whether ViTs can facilitate the feature learning in MVS? In this\npaper, we propose a pre-trained ViT enhanced MVS network called MVSFormer,\nwhich can learn more reliable feature representations benefited by informative\npriors from ViT. Then MVSFormer-P and MVSFormer-H are further proposed with\nfixed ViT weights and trainable ones respectively. MVSFormer-P is more\nefficient while MVSFormer-H can achieve superior performance. To make ViTs\nrobust to arbitrary resolutions for MVS tasks, we propose to use an efficient\nmulti-scale training with gradient accumulation. Moreover, we discuss the\nmerits and drawbacks of classification and regression-based MVS methods, and\nfurther propose to unify them with a temperature-based strategy. MVSFormer\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU dataset. Particularly, our\nanonymous submission of MVSFormer is ranked in the Top-1 position on both\nintermediate and advanced sets of the highly competitive Tanks-and-Temples\nleaderboard on the day of submission compared with other published works.

    "abstract": "Long-tailed image recognition presents massive challenges to deep learning\nsystems since the imbalance between majority (head) classes and minority (tail)\nclasses severely skews the data-driven deep neural networks. Previous methods\ntackle with data imbalance from the viewpoints of data distribution, feature\nspace, and model design, etc.In this work, instead of directly learning a\nrecognition model, we suggest confronting the bottleneck of head-to-tail bias\nbefore classifier learning, from the previously omitted perspective of\nbalancing label space. To alleviate the head-to-tail bias, we propose a concise\nparadigm by progressively adjusting label space and dividing the head classes\nand tail classes, dynamically constructing balance from imbalance to facilitate\nthe classification. With flexible data filtering and label space mapping, we\ncan easily embed our approach to most classification models, especially the\ndecoupled training methods. Besides, we find the separability of head-tail\nclasses varies among different features with different inductive biases. Hence,\nour proposed model also provides a feature evaluation method and paves the way\nfor long-tailed feature learning. Extensive experiments show that our method\ncan boost the performance of state-of-the-arts of different types on\nwidely-used benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/silicx/DLSA.",

However, 3D models have a structure, given by\nthe arrangement of salient parts, and shape and structure are deeply related to\nsemantics and functionality. Changing geometry without semantic clues may\ninvalidate such functionalities or the meaning of objects or their parts. Here,\nthe problem is approached by considering semantics as the formalised knowledge\nrelated to a category of objects; the geometry can vary provided that the\nsemantics is preserved. The semantics and the variable geometry of a class of\nshapes is represented through the parametric template: an annotated 3D model\nwhose geometry can be deformed provided that some semantic constraints remain\nsatisfied. In this work, the design and development of a framework for the\nsemantics-aware modelling of shapes is presented, offering the user a single\napplication environment where the whole workflow of defining the parametric\ntemplate and applying semantics-aware deformations can take place. In\nparticular, the system provides tools for the selection and annotation of\ngeometry based on a formalised contextual knowledge; shape analysis methods to\nderive new knowledge implicitly encoded in the geometry, and possibly enrich\nthe given semantics; a set of constraints that the user can apply to salient\nparts and a deformation operation that takes into account the semantic\nconstraints and provides an optimal solution.

    "abstract": "Surface grading, the process of leveling an uneven area containing pre-dumped\nsand piles, is an important task in the construction site pipeline. This\nlabour-intensive process is often carried out by a dozer, a key machinery tool\nat any construction site. Current attempts to automate surface grading assume\nperfect localization. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption fails,\nas agents are presented with imperfect perception, which leads to degraded\nperformance. In this work, we address the problem of autonomous grading under\nuncertainties. First, we implement a simulation and a scaled real-world\nprototype environment to enable rapid policy exploration and evaluation in this\nsetting. Second, we formalize the problem as a partially observable markov\ndecision process and train an agent capable of handling such uncertainties. We\nshow, through rigorous experiments, that an agent trained under perfect\nlocalization will suffer degraded performance when presented with localization\nuncertainties. However, an agent trained using our method will develop a more\nrobust policy for addressing such errors and, consequently, exhibit a better\ngrading performance.",

Most of studies have analyzed the impact of adopting a CI server\nservice (e.g, Travis-CI) but did not analyze CI sub-practices. Aims: We aim to\nevaluate the impact of five CI sub-practices with respect to the productivity\nand quality of GitHub open-source projects. Method: We collect CI sub-practices\nof 90 relevant open-source projects for a period of 2 years. We use regression\nmodels to analyze whether projects upholding the CI sub-practices are more\nproductive and/or generate fewer bugs. We also perform a qualitative document\nanalysis to understand whether CI best practices are related to a higher\nquality of projects. Results: Our findings reveal a correlation between the\nBuild Activity and Commit Activity sub-practices and the number of merged pull\nrequests. We also observe a correlation between the Build Activity, Build\nHealth and Time to Fix Broken Builds sub-practices and number of bug-related\nissues. The qualitative analysis reveals that projects with the best values for\nCI sub-practices face fewer CI-related problems compared to projects that\nexhibit the worst values for CI sub-practices. Conclusions: We recommend that\nprojects should strive to uphold the several CI sub-practices as they can\nimpact in the productivity and quality of projects.",

In this work we introduce the Streaming Tensor Train\nApproximation (STTA), a new class of algorithms for approximating a given\ntensor $\\mathcal T$ in the tensor train format. STTA accesses $\\mathcal T$\nexclusively via two-sided random sketches of the original data, making it\nstreamable and easy to implement in parallel -- unlike existing deterministic\nand randomized tensor train approximations. This property also allows STTA to\nconveniently leverage structure in $\\mathcal T$, such as sparsity and various\nlow-rank tensor formats, as well as linear combinations thereof. When Gaussian\nrandom matrices are used for sketching, STTA is admissible to an analysis that\nbuilds and extends upon existing results on the generalized Nystr\\\"om\napproximation for matrices. Our results show that STTA can be expected to\nattain a nearly optimal approximation error if the sizes of the sketches are\nsuitably chosen.

    "abstract": "Reservoir simulations for petroleum fields and seismic imaging are known as\nthe most demanding workloads for high-performance computing (HPC) in the oil\nand gas (O&G) industry. The optimization of the simulator numerical parameters\nplays a vital role as it could save considerable computational efforts.\nState-of-the-art optimization techniques are based on running numerous\nsimulations, specific for that purpose, to find good parameter candidates.\nHowever, using such an approach is highly costly in terms of time and computing\nresources. This work presents TunaOil, a new methodology to enhance the search\nfor optimal numerical parameters of reservoir flow simulations using a\nperformance model. In the O&G industry, it is common to use ensembles of models\nin different workflows to reduce the uncertainty associated with forecasting\nO&G production. We leverage the runs of those ensembles in such workflows to\nextract information from each simulation and optimize the numerical parameters\nin their subsequent runs.\nTo validate the methodology, we implemented it in a history matching (HM)\nprocess that uses a Kalman filter algorithm to adjust an ensemble of reservoir\nmodels to match the observed data from the real field. We mine past execution\nlogs from many simulations with different numerical configurations and build a\nmachine learning model based on extracted features from the data. These\nfeatures include properties of the reservoir models themselves, such as the\nnumber of active cells, to statistics of the simulation's behavior, such as the\nnumber of iterations of the linear solver. A sampling technique is used to\nquery the oracle to find the numerical parameters that can reduce the elapsed\ntime without significantly impacting the quality of the results. Our\nexperiments show that the predictions can improve the overall HM workflow\nruntime on average by 31%.",

    "abstract": "Aspiring to achieve an accurate Bitcoin price prediction based on people's\nopinions on Twitter usually requires millions of tweets, using different text\nmining techniques (preprocessing, tokenization, stemming, stop word removal),\nand developing a machine learning model to perform the prediction. These\nattempts lead to the employment of a significant amount of computer power,\ncentral processing unit (CPU) utilization, random-access memory (RAM) usage,\nand time. To address this issue, in this paper, we consider a classification of\ntweet attributes that effects on price changes and computer resource usage\nlevels while obtaining an accurate price prediction. To classify tweet\nattributes having a high effect on price movement, we collect all\nBitcoin-related tweets posted in a certain period and divide them into four\ncategories based on the following tweet attributes: $(i)$ the number of\nfollowers of the tweet poster, $(ii)$ the number of comments on the tweet,\n$(iii)$ the number of likes, and $(iv)$ the number of retweets. We separately\ntrain and test by using the Q-learning model with the above four categorized\nsets of tweets and find the best accurate prediction among them. Especially, we\ndesign several reward functions to improve the prediction accuracy of the\nQ-leaning. We compare our approach with a classic approach where all\nBitcoin-related tweets are used as input data for the model, by analyzing the\nCPU workloads, RAM usage, memory, time, and prediction accuracy. The results\nshow that tweets posted by users with the most followers have the most\ninfluence on a future price, and their utilization leads to spending 80\\% less\ntime, 88.8\\% less CPU consumption, and 12.5\\% more accurate predictions\ncompared with the classic approach.",

In this paper, we propose a novel\nskill assessment framework, Video Semantic Aggregation (ViSA), which discovers\ndifferent semantic parts and aggregates them across spatiotemporal dimensions.\nThe explicit discovery of semantic parts provides an explanatory visualization\nthat helps understand the neural network's decisions. It also enables us to\nfurther incorporate auxiliary information such as the kinematic data to improve\nrepresentation learning and performance.

    "title": "Semantic Interleaving Global Channel Attention for Multilabel Remote  Sensing Image Classification",
    "abstract": "Multi-Label Remote Sensing Image Classification (MLRSIC) has received\nincreasing research interest. Taking the cooccurrence relationship of multiple\nlabels as additional information helps to improve the performance of this task.\nCurrent methods focus on using it to constrain the final feature output of a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN). On the one hand, these methods do not make\nfull use of label correlation to form feature representation. On the other\nhand, they increase the label noise sensitivity of the system, resulting in\npoor robustness. In this paper, a novel method called Semantic Interleaving\nGlobal Channel Attention (SIGNA) is proposed for MLRSIC. First, the label\nco-occurrence graph is obtained according to the statistical information of the\ndata set. The label co-occurrence graph is used as the input of the Graph\nNeural Network (GNN) to generate optimal feature representations. Then, the\nsemantic features and visual features are interleaved, to guide the feature\nexpression of the image from the original feature space to the semantic feature\nspace with embedded label relations. SIGNA triggers global attention of feature\nmaps channels in a new semantic feature space to extract more important visual\nfeatures. Multihead SIGNA based feature adaptive weighting networks are\nproposed to act on any layer of CNN in a plug-and-play manner. For remote\nsensing images, better classification performance can be achieved by inserting\nCNN into the shallow layer. We conduct extensive experimental comparisons on\nthree data sets: UCM data set, AID data set, and DFC15 data set. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed SIGNA achieves superior classification\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. It is worth mentioning\nthat the codes of this paper will be open to the community for reproducibility\nresearch. Our codes are available at https://github.com/kyle-one/SIGNA.",

We specifically\nfocus on 2-round models, and we establish the complete picture of the relative\npowers of these models. That is, for every pair of such models, we determine\nwhether one is (strictly) stronger than the other, or whether the two models\nare incomparable. The separation results are obtained by approaching\ncommunication complexity through an original angle, which may be of independent\ninterest. The two players are not bounded to compute the value of a binary\nfunction, but the combined outputs of the two players are constrained by this\nvalue. In particular, we introduce the XOR-Index problem, in which Alice is\ngiven a binary vector $x\\in\\{0,1\\}^n$ together with an index $i\\in[n]$, Bob is\ngiven a binary vector $y\\in\\{0,1\\}^n$ together with an index $j\\in[n]$, and,\nafter a single round of 2-way communication, Alice must output a boolean\n$\\textrm{out}_A$, and Bob must output a boolean $\\textrm{out}_B$, such that\n$\\mbox{out}_A\\land\\mbox{out}_B = x_j\\oplus y_i$. We show that the communication\ncomplexity of XOR-Index is $\\Omega(n)$ bits.",

    "abstract": "Registration plays an important role in medical image analysis. Deep\nlearning-based methods have been studied for medical image registration, which\nleverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for efficiently regressing a\ndense deformation field from a pair of images. However, CNNs are limited in its\nability to extract semantically meaningful intra- and inter-image spatial\ncorrespondences, which are of importance for accurate image registration. This\nstudy proposes a novel end-to-end deep learning-based framework for\nunsupervised affine and diffeomorphic deformable registration, referred as\nACSGRegNet, which integrates a cross-attention module for establishing\ninter-image feature correspondences and a self-attention module for intra-image\nanatomical structures aware. Both attention modules are built on transformer\nencoders. The output from each attention module is respectively fed to a\ndecoder to generate a velocity field. We further introduce a gated fusion\nmodule to fuse both velocity fields. The fused velocity field is then\nintegrated to a dense deformation field. Extensive experiments are conducted on\nlumbar spine CT images. Once the model is trained, pairs of unseen lumbar\nvertebrae can be registered in one shot. Evaluated on 450 pairs of vertebral CT\ndata, our method achieved an average Dice of 0.963 and an average distance\nerror of 0.321mm, which are better than the state-of-the-art (SOTA).",

Furthermore, to\nimprove the performance of RCC-MUSIC, it is combined with the recent method of\ncovariance matrix estimation called correlation subspace.

In particular, we conduct researches on\nthree core questions: First, what to drop in self-attention layers? Different\nfrom dropping attention weights in literature, we propose to move dropout\noperations forward ahead of attention matrix calculation and set the Key as the\ndropout unit, yielding a novel dropout-before-softmax scheme. We theoretically\nverify that this scheme helps keep both regularization and probability features\nof attention weights, alleviating the overfittings problem to specific patterns\nand enhancing the model to globally capture vital information; Second, how to\nschedule the drop ratio in consecutive layers? In contrast to exploit a\nconstant drop ratio for all layers, we present a new decreasing schedule that\ngradually decreases the drop ratio along the stack of self-attention layers. We\nexperimentally validate the proposed schedule can avoid overfittings in\nlow-level features and missing in high-level semantics, thus improving the\nrobustness and stableness of model training; Third, whether need to perform\nstructured dropout operation as CNN? We attempt patch-based block-version of\ndropout operation and find that this useful trick for CNN is not essential for\nViT. Given exploration on the above three questions, we present the novel\nDropKey method that regards Key as the drop unit and exploits decreasing\nschedule for drop ratio, improving ViTs in a general way. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DropKey for various ViT\narchitectures, \\emph{e.g.} T2T and VOLO, as well as for various vision tasks,\n\\emph{e.g.}, image classification, object detection, human-object interaction\ndetection and human body shape recovery.

Firstly,\nwe factorize the complicated image-to-mesh mapping into two simpler mappings,\ni.e., image-to-point mapping and point-to-mesh mapping, while the latter is\nmainly a geometric problem and less dependent on object categories. Secondly,\nwe devise a local feature sampling strategy in 2D and 3D feature spaces to\ncapture the local geometry shared across objects to enhance model\ngeneralization. Thirdly, apart from the traditional point-to-point supervision,\nwe introduce a multi-view silhouette loss to supervise the surface generation\nprocess, which provides additional regularization and further relieves the\noverfitting problem. The experimental results show that our method\nsignificantly outperforms the existing works on the ShapeNet and Pix3D under\ndifferent scenarios and various metrics, especially for novel objects.",

Although deep learning is capable of\nextracting information from multiple sensory inputs, there has been little use\nof sound for the control and learning of robotic actions. For unsupervised\nreinforcement learning, an agent is expected to actively collect experiences\nand jointly learn representations and policies in a self-supervised way. We\nbuild realistic robotic manipulation scenarios with physics-based sound\nsimulation and propose the Intrinsic Sound Curiosity Module (ISCM). The ISCM\nprovides feedback to a reinforcement learner to learn robust representations\nand to reward a more efficient exploration behavior. We perform experiments\nwith sound enabled during pre-training and disabled during adaptation, and show\nthat representations learned by ISCM outperform the ones by vision-only\nbaselines and pre-trained policies can accelerate the learning process when\napplied to downstream tasks.",

We assess this possibility in the context of an\nintegrated TN-NTN, comprising a ground cellular deployment paired with a Low\nEarth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation, providing sub-6 GHz connectivity to\nan urban area populated by ground users (GUEs) and uncrewed aerial vehicles\n(UAVs). Our study reveals that offloading UAV traffic to the NTN segment\ndrastically reduces the downlink outage of UAVs from 70% to nearly zero, also\nboosting their uplink signal quality as long as the LEO satellite constellation\nis sufficiently dense to guarantee a minimum elevation angle. Offloading UAVs\nto the NTN also benefits coexisting GUEs, preventing uplink outages of around\n12% that GUEs would otherwise incur. Despite the limited bandwidth available\nbelow 6 GHz, NTN-offloaded UAVs meet command and control rate requirements even\nacross an area the size of Barcelona with as many as one active UAV per cell.\nSmaller UAV populations yield proportionally higher rates, potentially enabling\naerial broadband applications.",

    "abstract": "Landslides are destructive and recurrent natural disasters on steep slopes\nand represent a risk to lives and properties. Knowledge of relict landslides'\nlocation is vital to understand their mechanisms, update inventory maps and\nimprove risk assessment. However, relict landslide mapping is complex in\ntropical regions covered with rainforest vegetation. A new CNN approach is\nproposed for semi-automatic detection of relict landslides, which uses a\ndataset generated by a k-means clustering algorithm and has a pre-training\nstep. The weights computed in the pre-training are used to fine-tune the CNN\ntraining process. A comparison between the proposed and standard approaches is\nperformed using CBERS-4A WPM images. Three CNNs for semantic segmentation are\nused (U-Net, FPN, Linknet) with two augmented datasets. A total of 42\ncombinations of CNNs are tested. Values of precision and recall were very\nsimilar between the combinations tested. Recall was higher than 75\\% for every\ncombination, but precision values were usually smaller than 20\\%. False\npositives (FP) samples were addressed as the cause for these low precision\nvalues. Predictions of the proposed approach were more accurate and correctly\ndetected more landslides. This work demonstrates that there are limitations for\ndetecting relict landslides in areas covered with rainforest, mainly related to\nsimilarities between the spectral response of pastures and deforested areas\nwith \\textit{Gleichenella sp.} ferns, commonly used as an indicator of\nlandslide scars.",

While auditing has proven\ninvaluable to the security of traditional computers, existing audit frameworks\nare rarely designed with consideration for Real-Time Systems (RTS). The\ntransparency provided by system auditing would be of tremendous benefit in a\nvariety of security-critical RTS domains, (e.g., autonomous vehicles); however,\nif audit mechanisms are not carefully integrated into RTS, auditing can be\nrendered ineffectual and violate the real-world temporal requirements of the\nRTS.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate how to adapt commodity audit frameworks to RTS.\nUsing Linux Audit as a case study, we first demonstrate that the volume of\naudit events generated by commodity frameworks is unsustainable within the\ntemporal and resource constraints of real-time (RT) applications. To address\nthis, we present Ellipsis, a set of kernel-based reduction techniques that\nleverage the periodic repetitive nature of RT applications to aggressively\nreduce the costs of system-level auditing. Ellipsis generates succinct\ndescriptions of RT applications' expected activity while retaining a detailed\nrecord of unexpected activities, enabling analysis of suspicious activity while\nmeeting temporal constraints.

    "abstract": "On embedded processors that are increasingly equipped with multiple CPU\ncores, static hardware partitioning is an established means of consolidating\nand isolating workloads onto single chips. This architectural pattern is\nsuitable for mixed-criticality workloads that need to satisfy both, real-time\nand safety requirements, given suitable hardware properties. In this work, we\nfocus on exploiting contemporary virtualisation mechanisms to achieve freedom\nfrom interference respectively isolation between workloads. Possibilities to\nachieve temporal and spatial isolation-while maintaining real-time\ncapabilities-include statically partitioning resources, avoiding the sharing of\ndevices, and ascertaining zero interventions of superordinate control\nstructures. This eliminates overhead due to hardware partitioning, but implies\ncertain hardware capabilities that are not yet fully implemented in\ncontemporary standard systems. To address such hardware limitations, the\ncustomisable and configurable RISC-V instruction set architecture offers the\npossibility of swift, unrestricted modifications. We present findings on the\ncurrent RISC-V specification and its implementations that necessitate\ninterventions of superordinate control structures. We identify numerous issues\nadverse to implementing our goal of achieving zero interventions respectively\nzero overhead: On the design level, and especially with regards to handling\ninterrupts.

In this work, we propose 360Roam, a novel scene-level\nNeRF system that can synthesize images of large-scale indoor scenes in real\ntime and support VR roaming. Our system first builds an omnidirectional neural\nradiance field 360NeRF from multiple input $360^\\circ$ images. Using 360NeRF,\nwe then progressively estimate a 3D probabilistic occupancy map which\nrepresents the scene geometry in the form of spacial density.

Furthermore, we\nuse an adaptive divide-and-conquer strategy to slim and fine-tune the radiance\nfields for further improvement. The floorplan of the scene extracted from the\noccupancy map can provide guidance for ray sampling and facilitate a realistic\nroaming experience.

To overcome\nthis limitation, we collect a wide range of existing public datasets for three\ndistinct tasks, standardize them, and construct standard training and\nevaluation pipelines, providing us with a set of benchmarks and pretrained\nmodels. We then conduct a number of experiments using methods which are\ncommonly used in deep learning tasks, but unexplored in their domain-specific\napplications for agriculture. Our experiments guide us in developing a number\nof approaches to improve data efficiency when training agricultural deep\nlearning models, without large-scale modifications to existing pipelines. Our\nresults demonstrate that even slight training modifications, such as using\nagricultural pretrained model weights, or adopting specific spatial\naugmentations into data processing pipelines, can significantly boost model\nperformance and result in shorter convergence time, saving training resources.\nFurthermore, we find that even models trained on low-quality annotations can\nproduce comparable levels of performance to their high-quality equivalents,\nsuggesting that datasets with poor annotations can still be used for training,\nexpanding the pool of currently available datasets.

    "abstract": "Prediction of annual crop yields at a county granularity is important for\nnational food production and price stability. In this paper, towards the goal\nof better crop yield prediction, leveraging recent graph signal processing\n(GSP) tools to exploit spatial correlation among neighboring counties, we\ndenoise relevant features via graph spectral filtering that are inputs to a\ndeep learning prediction model. Specifically, we first construct a\ncombinatorial graph with edge weights that encode county-to-county similarities\nin soil and location features via metric learning. We then denoise features via\na maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation with a graph Laplacian regularizer\n(GLR). We focus on the challenge to estimate the crucial weight parameter\n$\\mu$, trading off the fidelity term and GLR, that is a function of noise\nvariance in an unsupervised manner. We first estimate noise variance directly\nfrom noise-corrupted graph signals using a graph clique detection (GCD)\nprocedure that discovers locally constant regions. We then compute an optimal\n$\\mu$ minimizing an approximate mean square error function via bias-variance\nanalysis. Experimental results from collected USDA data show that using\ndenoised features as input, performance of a crop yield prediction model can be\nimproved noticeably.",

    "abstract": "Checking whether a system of linear equations is consistent is a basic\ncomputational problem with ubiquitous applications. When dealing with\ninconsistent systems, one may seek an assignment that minimizes the number of\nunsatisfied equations. This problem is NP-hard and UGC-hard to approximate\nwithin any constant even for two-variable equations over the two-element field.\nWe study this problem from the point of view of parameterized complexity, with\nthe parameter being the number of unsatisfied equations. We consider equations\ndefined over Euclidean domains - a family of commutative rings that generalize\nfinite and infinite fields including the rationals, the ring of integers, and\nmany other structures. We show that if every equation contains at most two\nvariables, the problem is fixed-parameter tractable. This generalizes many\neminent graph separation problems such as Bipartization, Multiway Cut and\nMulticut parameterized by the size of the cutset. To complement this, we show\nthat the problem is W[1]-hard when three or more variables are allowed in an\nequation, as well as for many commutative rings that are not Euclidean domains.\nOn the technical side, we introduce the notion of important balanced subgraphs,\ngeneralizing important separators of Marx [Theor. Comput. Sci. 2006] to the\nsetting of biased graphs. Furthermore, we use recent results on parameterized\nMinCSP [Kim et al., SODA 2021] to efficiently solve a generalization of\nMulticut with disjunctive cut requests.",

    "abstract": "It has been observed that the performances of many high-dimensional\nestimation problems are universal with respect to underlying sensing (or\ndesign) matrices. Specifically, matrices with markedly different constructions\nseem to achieve identical performance if they share the same spectral\ndistribution and have ``generic'' singular vectors. We prove this universality\nphenomenon for the case of convex regularized least squares (RLS) estimators\nunder a linear regression model with additive Gaussian noise. Our main\ncontributions are two-fold: (1) We introduce a notion of universality classes\nfor sensing matrices, defined through a set of deterministic conditions that\nfix the spectrum of the sensing matrix and precisely capture the previously\nheuristic notion of generic singular vectors; (2) We show that for all sensing\nmatrices that lie in the same universality class, the dynamics of the proximal\ngradient descent algorithm for solving the regression problem, as well as the\nperformance of RLS estimators themselves (under additional strong convexity\nconditions) are asymptotically identical. In addition to including i.i.d.\nGaussian and rotational invariant matrices as special cases, our universality\nclass also contains highly structured, strongly correlated, or even (nearly)\ndeterministic matrices. Examples of the latter include randomly signed versions\nof incoherent tight frames and randomly subsampled Hadamard transforms. As a\nconsequence of this universality principle, the asymptotic performance of\nregularized linear regression on many structured matrices constructed with\nlimited randomness can be characterized by using the rotationally invariant\nensemble as an equivalent yet mathematically more tractable surrogate.",

When the time\ndiscretization of PDEs is performed implicitly, at each time-step a large-scale\nand ill-conditioned linear system must be solved, that, in case of Maxwell\nequations, is particularly challenging, because of the presence of both H(div)\nand H(curl) discretization spaces. We propose here a parallel preconditioner,\nthat exploits the Schur complement block factorization of the linear system\nmatrix and consists of a Jacobi preconditioner for the H(div) block and an\nauxiliary space preconditioner for the H(curl) block. Several parallel\nnumerical tests have been perfomed to study the robustness of the solver with\nrespect to mesh refinement, shape of polyhedral elements, time step size and\nthe VEM stabilization parameter.",

In order to circumvent the curse of\ndimensionality issue in traditional online kernel learning, we utilize random\nfeature (RF) mapping to convert the non-parametric kernel learning problem into\na fixed-length parametric one in the RF space. We then propose a novel learning\nframework named Online Decentralized Kernel learning via Linearized ADMM\n(ODKLA) to efficiently solve the online decentralized kernel learning problem.\nTo further improve the communication efficiency, we add the quantization and\ncensoring strategies in the communication stage and develop the Quantized and\nCommunication-censored ODKLA (QC-ODKLA) algorithm. We theoretically prove that\nboth ODKLA and QC-ODKLA can achieve the optimal sublinear regret\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ over $T$ time slots.

    "abstract": "This paper deals with existence and robust stability of hybrid limit cycles\nfor a class of hybrid systems given by the combination of continuous dynamics\non a flow set and discrete dynamics on a jump set. For this purpose, the notion\nof Zhukovskii stability, typically stated for continuous-time systems, is\nextended to the hybrid systems. Necessary conditions, particularly, a condition\nusing a forward invariance notion, for existence of hybrid limit cycles are\nfirst presented. In addition, a sufficient condition, related to Zhukovskii\nstability, for the existence of (or lack of) hybrid limit cycles is\nestablished. Furthermore, under mild assumptions, we show that asymptotic\nstability of such hybrid limit cycles is not only equivalent to asymptotic\nstability of a fixed point of the associated Poincar\\'{e} map but also robust\nto perturbations. Specifically, robustness to generic perturbations, which\ncapture state noise and unmodeled dynamics, and to inflations of the flow and\njump sets are established in terms of $\\mathcal{KL}$ bounds. Furthermore,\nresults establishing relationships between the properties of a computed\nPoincar\\'{e} map, which is necessarily affected by computational error, and the\nactual asymptotic stability properties of a hybrid limit cycle are proposed. In\nparticular, it is shown that asymptotic stability of the exact Poincar\\'{e} map\nis preserved when computed with enough precision.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method, called Modular Grammatical Evolution\n(MGE), towards validating the hypothesis that restricting the solution space of\nNeuroEvolution to modular and simple neural networks enables the efficient\ngeneration of smaller and more structured neural networks while providing\nacceptable (and in some cases superior) accuracy on large data sets. MGE also\nenhances the state-of-the-art Grammatical Evolution (GE) methods in two\ndirections. First, MGE's representation is modular in that each individual has\na set of genes, and each gene is mapped to a neuron by grammatical rules.\nSecond, the proposed representation mitigates two important drawbacks of GE,\nnamely the low scalability and weak locality of representation, towards\ngenerating modular and multi-layer networks with a high number of neurons. We\ndefine and evaluate five different forms of structures with and without\nmodularity using MGE and find single-layer modules with no coupling more\nproductive. Our experiments demonstrate that modularity helps in finding better\nneural networks faster. We have validated the proposed method using ten\nwell-known classification benchmarks with different sizes, feature counts, and\noutput class count. Our experimental results indicate that MGE provides\nsuperior accuracy with respect to existing NeuroEvolution methods and returns\nclassifiers that are significantly simpler than other machine learning\ngenerated classifiers. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that MGE outperforms\nother GE methods in terms of locality and scalability properties.",

The first regime is near initialization,\nspecifically until the weights have moved by $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt m)$, where $m$\ndenotes the network width, which is in sharp contrast to the $\\mathcal{O}(1)$\nweight motion allowed by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK); here it is shown that\nGF and SGD only need a network width and number of samples inversely\nproportional to the NTK margin, and moreover that GF attains at least the NTK\nmargin itself, which suffices to establish escape from bad KKT points of the\nmargin objective, whereas prior work could only establish nondecreasing but\narbitrarily small margins. The second regime is the Neural Collapse (NC)\nsetting, where data lies in extremely-well-separated groups, and the sample\ncomplexity scales with the number of groups; here the contribution over prior\nwork is an analysis of the entire GF trajectory from initialization. Lastly, if\nthe inner layer weights are constrained to change in norm only and can not\nrotate, then GF with large widths achieves globally maximal margins, and its\nsample complexity scales with their inverse; this is in contrast to prior work,\nwhich required infinite width and a tricky dual convergence assumption.

    "abstract": "Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged and shown their benefits\nover discrete representations in recent years. However, fitting an INR to the\ngiven observations usually requires optimization with gradient descent from\nscratch, which is inefficient and does not generalize well with sparse\nobservations. To address this problem, most of the prior works train a\nhypernetwork that generates a single vector to modulate the INR weights, where\nthe single vector becomes an information bottleneck that limits the\nreconstruction precision of the output INR. Recent work shows that the whole\nset of weights in INR can be precisely inferred without the single-vector\nbottleneck by gradient-based meta-learning. Motivated by a generalized\nformulation of gradient-based meta-learning, we propose a formulation that uses\nTransformers as hypernetworks for INRs, where it can directly build the whole\nset of INR weights with Transformers specialized as set-to-set mapping. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method for building INRs in different\ntasks and domains, including 2D image regression and view synthesis for 3D\nobjects. Our work draws connections between the Transformer hypernetworks and\ngradient-based meta-learning algorithms and we provide further analysis for\nunderstanding the generated INRs.

On the contrary, this work applies\nthe implicit semantic augmentation in feature space to capture the diversity of\nsource domains.

This raises the question: how do graph\nSSL methods, such as contrastive learning (CL), work well? To systematically\nprobe this question, we perform a generalization analysis for CL when using\ngeneric graph augmentations (GGAs), with a focus on data-centric properties.\nOur analysis yields formal insights into the limitations of GGAs and the\nnecessity of task-relevant augmentations.

Following the principle of prompting engineering, we transform point\nclouds into colorful images with geometry-preserved projection and\ngeometry-aware coloring to adapt to pre-trained image models, whose weights are\nkept frozen during the end-to-end optimization of point cloud analysis tasks.\nWe conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that cooperating with our\nproposed Point-to-Pixel Prompting, better pre-trained image model will lead to\nconsistently better performance in 3D vision. Enjoying prosperous development\nfrom image pre-training field, our method attains 89.3% accuracy on the hardest\nsetting of ScanObjectNN, surpassing conventional point cloud models with much\nfewer trainable parameters. Our framework also exhibits very competitive\nperformance on ModelNet classification and ShapeNet Part Segmentation. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/wangzy22/P2P",

    "abstract": "The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer, a sparsely-activated model controlled by\na router, has achieved great success in deep learning. However, the\nunderstanding of such architecture remains elusive. In this paper, we formally\nstudy how the MoE layer improves the performance of neural network learning and\nwhy the mixture model will not collapse into a single model. Our empirical\nresults suggest that the cluster structure of the underlying problem and the\nnon-linearity of the expert are pivotal to the success of MoE. To further\nunderstand this, we consider a challenging classification problem with\nintrinsic cluster structures, which is hard to learn using a single expert. Yet\nwith the MoE layer, by choosing the experts as two-layer nonlinear\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs), we show that the problem can be learned\nsuccessfully. Furthermore, our theory shows that the router can learn the\ncluster-center features, which helps divide the input complex problem into\nsimpler linear classification sub-problems that individual experts can conquer.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first result towards formally understanding the\nmechanism of the MoE layer for deep learning.",

    "abstract": "With the presence of online collaborative tools for software developers,\nsource code is shared and consulted frequently, from code viewers to merge\nrequests and code snippets. Typically, code highlighting quality in such\nscenarios is sacrificed in favor of system responsiveness. In these on-the-fly\nsettings, performing a formal grammatical analysis of the source code is not\nonly expensive, but also intractable for the many times the input is an invalid\nderivation of the language. Indeed, current popular highlighters heavily rely\non a system of regular expressions, typically far from the specification of the\nlanguage's lexer. Due to their complexity, regular expressions need to be\nperiodically updated as more feedback is collected from the users and their\ndesign unwelcome the detection of more complex language formations. This paper\ndelivers a deep learning-based approach suitable for on-the-fly grammatical\ncode highlighting of correct and incorrect language derivations, such as code\nviewers and snippets. It focuses on alleviating the burden on the developers,\nwho can reuse the language's parsing strategy to produce the desired\nhighlighting specification. Moreover, this approach is compared to nowadays\nonline syntax highlighting tools and formal methods in terms of accuracy and\nexecution time, across different levels of grammatical coverage, for three\nmainstream programming languages. The results obtained show how the proposed\napproach can consistently achieve near-perfect accuracy in its predictions,\nthereby outperforming regular expression-based strategies.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive language-image pretraining has shown great success in learning\nvisual-textual joint representation from web-scale data, demonstrating\nremarkable \"zero-shot\" generalization ability for various image tasks. However,\nhow to effectively expand such new language-image pretraining methods to video\ndomains is still an open problem. In this work, we present a simple yet\neffective approach that adapts the pretrained language-image models to video\nrecognition directly, instead of pretraining a new model from scratch. More\nconcretely, to capture the long-range dependencies of frames along the temporal\ndimension, we propose a cross-frame attention mechanism that explicitly\nexchanges information across frames. Such module is lightweight and can be\nplugged into pretrained language-image models seamlessly. Moreover, we propose\na video-specific prompting scheme, which leverages video content information\nfor generating discriminative textual prompts. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach is effective and can be generalized to different\nvideo recognition scenarios. In particular, under fully-supervised settings,\nour approach achieves a top-1 accuracy of 87.1% on Kinectics-400, while using\n12 times fewer FLOPs compared with Swin-L and ViViT-H. In zero-shot\nexperiments, our approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods by\n+7.6% and +14.9% in terms of top-1 accuracy under two popular protocols. In\nfew-shot scenarios, our approach outperforms previous best methods by +32.1%\nand +23.1% when the labeled data is extremely limited. Code and models are\navailable at https://aka.ms/X-CLIP",

    "abstract": "Single-view RGB-D human reconstruction with implicit functions is often\nformulated as per-point classification. Specifically, a set of 3D locations\nwithin the view-frustum of the camera are first projected independently onto\nthe image and a corresponding feature is subsequently extracted for each 3D\nlocation. The feature of each 3D location is then used to classify\nindependently whether the corresponding 3D point is inside or outside the\nobserved object. This procedure leads to sub-optimal results because\ncorrelations between predictions for neighboring locations are only taken into\naccount implicitly via the extracted features. For more accurate results we\npropose the occupancy planes (OPlanes) representation, which enables to\nformulate single-view RGB-D human reconstruction as occupancy prediction on\nplanes which slice through the camera's view frustum. Such a representation\nprovides more flexibility than voxel grids and enables to better leverage\ncorrelations than per-point classification. On the challenging S3D data we\nobserve a simple classifier based on the OPlanes representation to yield\ncompelling results, especially in difficult situations with partial occlusions\ndue to other objects and partial visibility, which haven't been addressed by\nprior work.",

As a test case, we use a\nNewtonian telescope structure. This work is motivated by the need for the\ndevelopment of model-based data-driven techniques for prediction, estimation,\nand control of thermal effects and thermally-induced wavefront aberrations in\noptical systems, such as ground and space telescopes, optical instruments\noperating in harsh environments, optical lithography machines, and optical\ncomponents of high-power laser systems. We estimate and validate a state-space\nmodel of a transient STOP dynamics. First, we model the system in COMSOL\nMultiphysics. Then, we use LiveLink for MATLAB software module to export the\nwavefront aberrations data from COMSOL to MATLAB. This data is used to test the\nsubspace identification method that is implemented in Python. One of the main\nchallenges in modeling and estimation of STOP models is that they are\ninherently large-dimensional. The large-scale nature of STOP models originates\nfrom the coupling of optical, thermal, and structural phenomena and physical\nprocesses. Our results show that large-dimensional STOP dynamics of the\nconsidered optical system can be accurately estimated by low-dimensional\nstate-space models.

Such a model can then be synthesized into a\nhardware accelerator for use in quantum systems. In this study, we demonstrate\na machine learning algorithm for predicting optimal pulse parameters. This\nalgorithm is lightweight enough to fit on a low-resource FPGA and perform\ninference with a latency of 175 ns and pipeline interval of 5 ns with $~>~$0.99\ngate fidelity. In the long term, such an accelerator could be used near quantum\ncomputing hardware where traditional computers cannot operate, enabling quantum\ncontrol at a reasonable cost at low latencies without incurring large data\nbandwidths outside of the cryogenic environment.",

    "abstract": "The approaches by which the machine learning and clinical research\ncommunities utilize real world data (RWD), including data captured in the\nelectronic health record (EHR), vary dramatically. While clinical researchers\ncautiously use RWD for clinical investigations, ML for healthcare teams consume\npublic datasets with minimal scrutiny to develop new algorithms. This study\nbridges this gap by developing and validating ML-DQA, a data quality assurance\nframework grounded in RWD best practices. The ML-DQA framework is applied to\nfive ML projects across two geographies, different medical conditions, and\ndifferent cohorts. A total of 2,999 quality checks and 24 quality reports were\ngenerated on RWD gathered on 247,536 patients across the five projects. Five\ngeneralizable practices emerge: all projects used a similar method to group\nredundant data element representations; all projects used automated utilities\nto build diagnosis and medication data elements; all projects used a common\nlibrary of rules-based transformations; all projects used a unified approach to\nassign data quality checks to data elements; and all projects used a similar\napproach to clinical adjudication. An average of 5.8 individuals, including\nclinicians, data scientists, and trainees, were involved in implementing ML-DQA\nfor each project and an average of 23.4 data elements per project were either\ntransformed or removed in response to ML-DQA. This study demonstrates the\nimportance role of ML-DQA in healthcare projects and provides teams a framework\nto conduct these essential activities.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) applied to a device's radio-frequency fingerprint~(RFF)\nhas attracted significant attention in physical-layer authentications due to\nits extraordinary classification performance. Conventional DL-RFF techniques,\ntrained by adopting maximum likelihood estimation~(MLE), tend to overfit the\nchannel statistics embedded in the training dataset. This restricts their\npractical applications as it is challenging to collect sufficient training data\ncapturing the characteristics of all possible wireless channel environments. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a DL framework of disentangled\nrepresentation learning~(DRL) that first learns to factor the input signals\ninto a device-relevant component and a device-irrelevant component via\nadversarial learning. Then, it synthesizes a set of augmented signals by\nshuffling these two parts within a given training dataset for training of\nsubsequent RFF extractor. The implicit data augmentation in the proposed\nframework imposes a regularization on the RFF extractor to avoid the possible\noverfitting of device-irrelevant channel statistics, without collecting\nadditional data from unknown channels. Experiments validate that the proposed\napproach, referred to as DR-RFF, outperforms conventional methods in terms of\ngeneralizability to unknown complicated propagation environments, e.g.,\ndispersive multipath fading channels, even though all the training data are\ncollected in a simple environment with dominated direct line-of-sight~(LoS)\npropagation paths.",

    "title": "Quantum Error Correction via Noise Guessing Decoding",
    "abstract": "Quantum error correction codes (QECCs) play a central role both in quantum\ncommunications and in quantum computation, given how error-prone quantum\ntechnologies are. Practical quantum error correction codes, such as stabilizer\ncodes, are generally structured to suit a specific use, and present rigid code\nlengths and code rates, limiting their adaptability to changing requirements.\nThis paper shows that it is possible to both construct and decode QECCs that\ncan attain the maximum performance of the finite blocklength regime, for any\nchosen code length and when the code rate is sufficiently high. A recently\nproposed strategy for decoding classical codes called GRAND (guessing random\nadditive noise decoding) opened doors to decoding classical random linear codes\n(RLCs) that perform near the capacity of the finite blocklength regime. By\nmaking use of the noise statistics, GRAND is a noise-centric efficient\nuniversal decoder for classical codes, providing there is a simple code\nmembership test. These conditions are particularly suitable for quantum systems\nand therefore the paper extends these concepts to quantum random linear codes\n(QRLCs), which were known to be possible to construct but whose decoding was\nnot yet feasible. By combining QRLCs and a newly proposed quantum GRAND, this\npaper shows that decoding versatile quantum error correction is possible,\nallowing for QECCs that are simple to adapt on the fly to changing conditions.\nThe paper starts by assessing the minimum number of gates in the coding circuit\nneeded to reach the QRLCs' asymptotic performance, and subsequently proposes a\nquantum GRAND algorithm that makes use of quantum noise statistics, not only to\nbuild an adaptive code membership test, but also to efficiently implement\nsyndrome decoding.",

    "title": "Data-driven Attention and Data-independent DCT based Global Context  Modeling for Text-independent Speaker Recognition",
    "abstract": "Learning an effective speaker representation is crucial for achieving\nreliable performance in speaker verification tasks. Speech signals are\nhigh-dimensional, long, and variable-length sequences that entail a complex\nhierarchical structure. Signals may contain diverse information at each\ntime-frequency (TF) location. For example, it may be more beneficial to focus\non high-energy parts for phoneme classes such as fricatives. The standard\nconvolutional layer that operates on neighboring local regions cannot capture\nthe complex TF global context information. In this study, a general global\ntime-frequency context modeling framework is proposed to leverage the context\ninformation specifically for speaker representation modeling. First, a\ndata-driven attention-based context model is introduced to capture the\nlong-range and non-local relationship across different time-frequency\nlocations. Second, a data-independent 2D-DCT based context model is proposed to\nimprove model interpretability. A multi-DCT attention mechanism is presented to\nimprove modeling power with alternate DCT base forms. Finally, the global\ncontext information is used to recalibrate salient time-frequency locations by\ncomputing the similarity between the global context and local features. The\nproposed lightweight blocks can be easily incorporated into a speaker model\nwith little additional computational costs and effectively improves the speaker\nverification performance compared to the standard ResNet model and\nSqueeze\\&Excitation block by a large margin. Detailed ablation studies are also\nperformed to analyze various factors that may impact performance of the\nproposed individual modules. Results from experiments show that the proposed\nglobal context modeling framework can efficiently improve the learned speaker\nrepresentations by achieving channel-wise and time-frequency feature\nrecalibration.",
