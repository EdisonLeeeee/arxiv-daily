    "abstract": "In today's modern digital world, we have a number of online Question and\nAnswer platforms like Stack Exchange, Quora, and GFG that serve as a medium for\npeople to communicate and help each other. In this paper, we analyzed the\neffectiveness of Stack Overflow in helping newbies to programming. Every user\non this platform goes through a journey. For the first 12 months, we consider\nthem to be a newbie. Post 12 months they come under one of the following\ncategories: Experienced, Lurkers, or Inquisitive. Each question asked has tags\nassigned to it and we observe that questions with some specific tags have a\nfaster response time indicating an active community in that field over others.\nThe platform had a steady growth up to 2013 after which it started declining,\nbut recently during the pandemic 2020, we can see rejuvenated activity on the\nplatform.",

    "abstract": "Many effective attempts have been made for deepfake audio detection. However,\nthey can only distinguish between real and fake. For many practical application\nscenarios, what tool or algorithm generated the deepfake audio also is needed.\nThis raises a question: Can we detect the system fingerprints of deepfake\naudio? Therefore, this paper conducts a preliminary investigation to detect\nsystem fingerprints of deepfake audio. Experiments are conducted on deepfake\naudio datasets from five latest deep-learning speech synthesis systems. The\nresults show that LFCC features are relatively more suitable for system\nfingerprints detection. Moreover, the ResNet achieves the best detection\nresults among LCNN and x-vector based models. The t-SNE visualization shows\nthat different speech synthesis systems generate distinct system fingerprints.",

The attention mechanism can help the system focus more on\nthe feature space's critical regions. For example, high amplitude regions can\nplay an important role for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER).

To improve the attention area, we propose\nto use a Focus-Attention (FA) mechanism and a novel Calibration-Attention (CA)\nmechanism in combination with the multi-head self-attention. Through the FA\nmechanism, the network can detect the largest amplitude part in the segment. By\nemploying the CA mechanism, the network can modulate the information flow by\nassigning different weights to each attention head and improve the utilization\nof surrounding contexts. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments are\nperformed with the IEMOCAP and RAVDESS datasets.

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, graph representation learning (GRL) has been a\npowerful strategy for analyzing graph-structured data. Recently, GRL methods\nhave shown promising results by adopting self-supervised learning methods\ndeveloped for learning representations of images. Despite their success,\nexisting GRL methods tend to overlook an inherent distinction between images\nand graphs, i.e., images are assumed to be independently and identically\ndistributed, whereas graphs exhibit relational information among data\ninstances, i.e., nodes. To fully benefit from the relational information\ninherent in the graph-structured data, we propose a novel GRL method, called\nRGRL, that learns from the relational information generated from the graph\nitself. RGRL learns node representations such that the relationship among nodes\nis invariant to augmentations, i.e., augmentation-invariant relationship, which\nallows the node representations to vary as long as the relationship among the\nnodes is preserved. By considering the relationship among nodes in both global\nand local perspectives, RGRL overcomes limitations of previous contrastive and\nnon-contrastive methods, and achieves the best of both worlds. Extensive\nexperiments on fourteen benchmark datasets over various downstream tasks\ndemonstrate the superiority of RGRL over state-of-the-art baselines.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for systematically solving\ndataset condensation problem in an efficient manner by exploiting the\nregularity in a given dataset. Instead of condensing the dataset directly in\nthe original input space, we assume a generative process of the dataset with a\nset of learnable codes defined in a compact latent space followed by a set of\ntiny decoders which maps them differently to the original input space. By\ncombining different codes and decoders interchangeably, we can dramatically\nincrease the number of synthetic examples with essentially the same parameter\ncount, because the latent space is much lower dimensional and since we can\nassume as many decoders as necessary to capture different styles represented in\nthe dataset with negligible cost. Such knowledge factorization allows efficient\nsharing of information between synthetic examples in a systematic way,\nproviding far better trade-off between compression ratio and quality of the\ngenerated examples.

Speaker\nanonymization aims to transform a speech signal to remove the source speaker's\nidentity while leaving the spoken content unchanged. Current methods perform\nthe transformation by relying on content/speaker disentanglement and voice\nconversion. Usually, an acoustic model from an automatic speech recognition\nsystem extracts the content representation while an x-vector system extracts\nthe speaker representation. Prior work has shown that the extracted features\nare not perfectly disentangled. This paper tackles how to improve features\ndisentanglement, and thus the converted anonymized speech.

The input of symbols and commands is also challenging because these\nmay be misrecognized as text letters. To address these problems, this study\nproposes a speech interaction method called DualVoice, by which commands can be\ninput in a whispered voice and letters in a normal voice. The proposed method\ndoes not require any specialized hardware other than a regular microphone,\nenabling a complete hands-free interaction. The method can be used in a wide\nrange of situations where speech recognition is already available, ranging from\ntext input to mobile/wearable computing. Two neural networks were designed in\nthis study, one for discriminating normal speech from whispered speech, and the\nsecond for recognizing whisper speech.

Our improvement increases\nthe scope of the estimator from differentiable models to non-differentiable\nones without requiring manual intervention of the user; the improved estimator\nautomatically identifies differentiable parts of a given probabilistic program\nusing our static analysis, and applies the pathwise gradient estimator to the\nidentified parts while using a more general but less efficient estimator,\ncalled score estimator, for the rest of the program. Our analysis has a\nsurprisingly subtle soundness argument, partly due to the misbehaviours of some\ntarget smoothness properties when viewed from the perspective of program\nanalysis designers. For instance, some smoothness properties are not preserved\nby function composition, and this makes it difficult to analyse sequential\ncomposition soundly without heavily sacrificing precision. We formulate five\nassumptions on a target smoothness property, prove the soundness of our\nanalysis under those assumptions, and show that our leading examples satisfy\nthese assumptions. We also show that by using information from our analysis,\nour improved gradient estimator satisfies an important differentiability\nrequirement and thus, under a mild regularity condition, computes the correct\nestimate on average, i.e., it returns an unbiased estimate. Our experiments\nwith representative probabilistic programs in the Pyro language show that our\nstatic analysis is capable of identifying smooth parts of those programs\naccurately, and making our improved pathwise gradient estimator exploit all the\nopportunities for high performance in those programs.",

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation aims at aligning the labeled source domain and the\nunlabeled target domain, and most existing approaches assume the source data is\naccessible. Unfortunately, this paradigm raises concerns in data privacy and\nsecurity. Recent studies try to dispel these concerns by the Source-Free\nsetting, which adapts the source-trained model towards target domain without\nexposing the source data. However, the Source-Free paradigm is still at risk of\ndata leakage due to adversarial attacks to the source model. Hence, the\nBlack-Box setting is proposed, where only the outputs of source model can be\nutilized. In this paper, we address both the Source-Free adaptation and the\nBlack-Box adaptation, proposing a novel method named better target\nrepresentation from Frequency Mixup and Mutual Learning (FMML). Specifically,\nwe introduce a new data augmentation technique as Frequency MixUp, which\nhighlights task-relevant objects in the interpolations, thus enhancing\nclass-consistency and linear behavior for target models. Moreover, we introduce\na network regularization method called Mutual Learning to the domain adaptation\nproblem. It transfers knowledge inside the target model via self-knowledge\ndistillation and thus alleviates overfitting on the source domain by learning\nmulti-scale target representations.

Therefore, this paper attempts to develop a generalized\ntheory for the design of the stabilizing feedback law wherever possible for a\ngeneral class of systems, including the systems in standard structured and\nunstructured forms discussed in the existing literature. The theory behind this\ngeneral controller design theory utilizes the idea of an invariant target\nmanifold giving rise to a non-degenerate two form, through which the definition\nof certain passive outputs and storage functions leads to a generation of\ncontrol law for stabilizing the system. Because the above concepts are linked\nwith the Immersion and Invariance (I&I) design policy and the passivity theory\nof controller design, the proposed methodology is labeled as the \"Passivity and\nImmersion (P&I) approach\". Furthermore, being a constructive methodology, the\nvarious worked examples in this paper exemplify and demonstrate the various\ndesign paradigms such as Backstepping, Incremental Backstepping, Forwarding,\nI&I, and the techniques based on the generation of Control Contraction Metrics\n(CCM) can be unified in the P&I methodology.",

    "abstract": "Reducing computational complexity of the modern wireless communication\nsystems such as massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) configurations is\nof utmost interest. In this paper, we propose new algorithm that can be used to\naccelerate matrix inversion in the decoding of space-time block codes (STBC) in\nthe uplink of dynamic massive MIMO systems. A multi-user system in which the\nbase station is equipped with a large number of antennas and each user has two\nantennas is considered. In addition, users can enter or exit the system\ndynamically. For a given space-time block coding/decoding scheme the\ncomputational complexity of the receiver will be significantly reduced when a\nuser is added to or removed from the system by employing the proposed method.\nIn the proposed scheme, the matrix inversion for zero-forcing (ZF) as well as\nminimum mean square error (MMSE) decoding is derived from the inverse of a\npartitioned matrix and the Woodbury matrix identity. Furthermore, the suggested\ntechnique can be utilized when the number of users is fixed but the channel\nestimate changes for a particular user. The mathematical equations for updating\nthe inverse of the decoding matrices are derived and its complexity is compared\nto the direct way of computing the inverse. Evaluations confirm the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Face image synthesis has progressed beyond the point at which humans can\neffectively distinguish authentic faces from synthetically generated ones.\nRecently developed synthetic face image detectors boast \"better-than-human\"\ndiscriminative ability, especially those guided by human perceptual\nintelligence during the model's training process. In this paper, we investigate\nwhether these human-guided synthetic face detectors can assist non-expert human\noperators in the task of synthetic image detection when compared to models\ntrained without human-guidance. We conducted a large-scale experiment with more\nthan 1,560 subjects classifying whether an image shows an authentic or\nsynthetically-generated face, and annotate regions that supported their\ndecisions. In total, 56,015 annotations across 3,780 unique face images were\ncollected. All subjects first examined samples without any AI support, followed\nby samples given (a) the AI's decision (\"synthetic\" or \"authentic\"), (b) class\nactivation maps illustrating where the model deems salient for its decision, or\n(c) both the AI's decision and AI's saliency map. Synthetic faces were\ngenerated with six modern Generative Adversarial Networks. Interesting\nobservations from this experiment include: (1) models trained with\nhuman-guidance offer better support to human examination of face images when\ncompared to models trained traditionally using cross-entropy loss, (2) binary\ndecisions presented to humans offers better support than saliency maps, (3)\nunderstanding the AI's accuracy helps humans to increase trust in a given model\nand thus increase their overall accuracy. This work demonstrates that although\nhumans supported by machines achieve better-than-random accuracy of synthetic\nface detection, the ways of supplying humans with AI support and of building\ntrust are key factors determining high effectiveness of the human-AI tandem.",

It is not easy to\ndetermine if CAP was successful without a long follow-up assessing for AF\nrecurrence (AFR). Therefore, an AFR risk prediction algorithm could enable a\nbetter management of CAP patients. In this research, we extracted features from\n12-lead ECG recorded before and after CAP and train an AFR risk prediction\nmachine learning model. Methods: Pre- and post-CAP segments were extracted from\n112 patients. The analysis included a signal quality criterion, heart rate\nvariability and morphological biomarkers engineered from the 12-lead ECG (804\nfeatures overall). 43 out of the 112 patients (n) had AFR clinical endpoint\navailable. These were utilized to assess the feasibility of AFR risk\nprediction, using either pre or post CAP features. A random forest classifier\nwas trained within a nested cross validation framework. Results: 36 features\nwere found statistically significant for distinguishing between the pre and\npost surgery states (n=112). For the classification, an area under the receiver\noperating characteristic (AUROC) curve was reported with AUROC_pre=0.64 and\nAUROC_post=0.74 (n=43).

First, it describes the most\nauthoritative evaluation to date of iris PAD. We have curated the largest\npublicly-available image dataset for this problem, drawing from 26 benchmarks\npreviously released by various groups, and adding 150,000 images being released\nwith the journal version of this paper, to create a set of 450,000 images\nrepresenting authentic iris and seven types of presentation attack instrument\n(PAI). We formulate a leave-one-PAI-out evaluation protocol, and show that even\nthe best algorithms in the closed-set evaluations exhibit catastrophic failures\non multiple attack types in the open-set scenario. This includes algorithms\nperforming well in the most recent LivDet-Iris 2020 competition, which may come\nfrom the fact that the LivDet-Iris protocol emphasizes sequestered images\nrather than unseen attack types. Second, we evaluate the accuracy of five\nopen-source iris presentation attack algorithms available today, one of which\nis newly-proposed in this paper, and build an ensemble method that beats the\nwinner of the LivDet-Iris 2020 by a substantial margin.

To our knowledge, however, no previous work systematically\nexplored how modifying the ANN's spectral properties affects performance. To\nfill this gap, we performed a systematic search over spectral regularizers,\nforcing the ANN's eigenspectrum to follow $1/n^\\alpha$ power laws with\ndifferent exponents $\\alpha$. We found that larger powers (around 2--3) lead to\nbetter validation accuracy and more robustness to adversarial attacks on dense\nnetworks. This surprising finding applied to both shallow and deep networks and\nit overturns the notion that the brain-like spectrum (corresponding to $\\alpha\n\\sim 1$) always optimizes ANN performance and/or robustness. For convolutional\nnetworks, the best $\\alpha$ values depend on the task complexity and evaluation\nmetric: lower $\\alpha$ values optimized validation accuracy and robustness to\nadversarial attack for networks performing a simple object recognition task\n(categorizing MNIST images of handwritten digits); for a more complex task\n(categorizing CIFAR-10 natural images), we found that lower $\\alpha$ values\noptimized validation accuracy whereas higher $\\alpha$ values optimized\nadversarial robustness. These results have two main implications. First, they\ncast doubt on the notion that brain-like spectral properties ($\\alpha \\sim 1$)\n\\emph{always} optimize ANN performance. Second, they demonstrate the potential\nfor fine-tuned spectral regularizers to optimize a chosen design metric, i.e.,\naccuracy and/or robustness.",

    "abstract": "\\emph{Cardinality Estimation} (aka \\emph{Distinct Elements}) is a classic\nproblem in sketching with many industrial applications. Although sketching\n\\emph{algorithms} are fairly simple, analyzing the cardinality\n\\emph{estimators} is notoriously difficult, and even today the state-of-the-art\nsketches such as HyperLogLog and (compressed) \\PCSA{} are not covered in\ngraduate level Big Data courses.\nIn this paper we define a class of \\emph{generalized remaining area} (\\tGRA)\nestimators, and observe that HyperLogLog, LogLog, and some estimators for PCSA\nare merely instantiations of \\tGRA{} for various integral values of $\\tau$. We\nthen analyze the limiting relative variance of \\tGRA{} estimators. It turns out\nthat the standard estimators for HyperLogLog and PCSA can be improved by\nchoosing a \\emph{fractional} value of $\\tau$. The resulting estimators come\n\\emph{very} close to the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao lower bounds for HyperLogLog{} and PCSA\nderived from their Fisher information. Although the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao lower bound\n\\emph{can} be achieved with the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), the MLE is\ncumbersome to compute and dynamically update. In contrast, \\tGRA{} estimators\nare trivial to update in constant time.\nOur presentation assumes only basic calculus and probability, not any complex\nanalysis~\\cite{FlajoletM85,DurandF03,FlajoletFGM07}.",

    "abstract": "Evolution Strategy (ES) is a powerful black-box optimization technique based\non the idea of natural evolution. In each of its iterations, a key step entails\nranking candidate solutions based on some fitness score. For an ES method in\nReinforcement Learning (RL), this ranking step requires evaluating multiple\npolicies. This is presently done via on-policy approaches: each policy's score\nis estimated by interacting several times with the environment using that\npolicy. This leads to a lot of wasteful interactions since, once the ranking is\ndone, only the data associated with the top-ranked policies is used for\nsubsequent learning. To improve sample efficiency, we propose a novel\noff-policy alternative for ranking, based on a local approximation for the\nfitness function. We demonstrate our idea in the context of a state-of-the-art\nES method called the Augmented Random Search (ARS). Simulations in MuJoCo tasks\nshow that, compared to the original ARS, our off-policy variant has similar\nrunning times for reaching reward thresholds but needs only around 70% as much\ndata. It also outperforms the recent Trust Region ES. We believe our ideas\nshould be extendable to other ES methods as well.",

    "abstract": "Effective understanding of dynamically evolving multiagent interactions is\ncrucial to capturing the underlying behavior of agents in social systems. It is\nusually challenging to observe these interactions directly, and therefore\nmodeling the latent interactions is essential for realizing the complex\nbehaviors. Recent work on Dynamic Neural Relational Inference (DNRI) captures\nexplicit inter-agent interactions at every step. However, prediction at every\nstep results in noisy interactions and lacks intrinsic interpretability without\npost-hoc inspection. Moreover, it requires access to ground truth annotations\nto analyze the predicted interactions, which are hard to obtain. This paper\nintroduces DIDER, Discovering Interpretable Dynamically Evolving Relations, a\ngeneric end-to-end interaction modeling framework with intrinsic\ninterpretability. DIDER discovers an interpretable sequence of inter-agent\ninteractions by disentangling the task of latent interaction prediction into\nsub-interaction prediction and duration estimation. By imposing the consistency\nof a sub-interaction type over an extended time duration, the proposed\nframework achieves intrinsic interpretability without requiring any post-hoc\ninspection. We evaluate DIDER on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that modeling disentangled and interpretable\ndynamic relations improves performance on trajectory forecasting tasks.",

The advent of speech-text alignment\nalgorithms provides an opportunity for inexpensive, automated, and accurate\nanalysis of speech measures in individuals with ALS. There is a need to\nvalidate speech and pause features calculated by these algorithms against\ncurrent gold standard methods. In this study, we extracted 8 speech/pause\nfeatures from 646 audio files of individuals with ALS and healthy controls\nperforming passage reading. Two pretrained forced alignment models - one using\ntransformers and another using a Gaussian mixture / hidden Markov architecture\n- were used for automatic feature extraction. The results were then validated\nagainst semi-automatic speech/pause analysis software, with further subgroup\nanalyses based on audio quality and disease severity. Features extracted using\ntransformer-based forced alignment had the highest agreement with gold\nstandards, including in terms of audio quality and disease severity.

    "title": "RIBAC: Towards Robust and Imperceptible Backdoor Attack against Compact  DNN",
    "abstract": "Recently backdoor attack has become an emerging threat to the security of\ndeep neural network (DNN) models. To date, most of the existing studies focus\non backdoor attack against the uncompressed model; while the vulnerability of\ncompressed DNNs, which are widely used in the practical applications, is little\nexploited yet. In this paper, we propose to study and develop Robust and\nImperceptible Backdoor Attack against Compact DNN models (RIBAC). By performing\nsystematic analysis and exploration on the important design knobs, we propose a\nframework that can learn the proper trigger patterns, model parameters and\npruning masks in an efficient way. Thereby achieving high trigger stealthiness,\nhigh attack success rate and high model efficiency simultaneously. Extensive\nevaluations across different datasets, including the test against the\nstate-of-the-art defense mechanisms, demonstrate the high robustness,\nstealthiness and model efficiency of RIBAC.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are highly effective on a variety of\ngraph-related tasks; however, they lack interpretability and transparency.\nCurrent explainability approaches are typically local and treat GNNs as\nblack-boxes. They do not look inside the model, inhibiting human trust in the\nmodel and explanations. Motivated by the ability of neurons to detect\nhigh-level semantic concepts in vision models, we perform a novel analysis on\nthe behaviour of individual GNN neurons to answer questions about GNN\ninterpretability, and propose new metrics for evaluating the interpretability\nof GNN neurons. We propose a novel approach for producing global explanations\nfor GNNs using neuron-level concepts to enable practitioners to have a\nhigh-level view of the model. Specifically, (i) to the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work which shows that GNN neurons act as concept detectors\nand have strong alignment with concepts formulated as logical compositions of\nnode degree and neighbourhood properties; (ii) we quantitatively assess the\nimportance of detected concepts, and identify a trade-off between training\nduration and neuron-level interpretability; (iii) we demonstrate that our\nglobal explainability approach has advantages over the current state-of-the-art\n-- we can disentangle the explanation into individual interpretable concepts\nbacked by logical descriptions, which reduces potential for bias and improves\nuser-friendliness.",

    "title": "Learning to Solve Optimization Problems with Hard Linear Constraints",
    "abstract": "Constrained optimization problems appear in a wide variety of challenging\nreal-world problems, where constraints often capture the physics of the\nunderlying system. Classic methods for solving these problems rely on iterative\nalgorithms that explore the feasible domain in the search for the best\nsolution. These iterative methods are often the computational bottleneck in\ndecision-making and adversely impact time-sensitive applications. Recently,\nneural approximators have shown promise as a replacement for the iterative\nsolvers that can output the optimal solution in a single feed-forward providing\nrapid solutions to optimization problems. However, enforcing constraints\nthrough neural networks remains an open challenge. This paper develops a neural\napproximator that maps the inputs to an optimization problem with hard linear\nconstraints to a feasible solution that is nearly optimal. Our proposed\napproach consists of four main steps: 1) reducing the original problem to\noptimization on a set of independent variables, 2) finding a gauge function\nthat maps the infty-norm unit ball to the feasible set of the reduced problem,\n3)learning a neural approximator that maps the optimization's inputs to an\noptimal point in the infty-norm unit ball, and 4) find the values of the\ndependent variables from the independent variable and recover the solution to\nthe original problem. We can guarantee hard feasibility through this sequence\nof steps. Unlike the current learning-assisted solutions, our method is free of\nparameter-tuning and removes iterations altogether. We demonstrate the\nperformance of our proposed method in quadratic programming in the context of\nthe optimal power dispatch (critical to the resiliency of our electric grid)\nand a constrained non-convex optimization in the context of image registration\nproblems.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an implementation of a leaning-based control of a\ndifferential drive telepresence robot and a user study in simulation, with the\ngoal of bringing the same functionality to a real telepresence robot. The\nparticipants used a balance board to control the robot and viewed the virtual\nenvironment through a head-mounted display. The main motivation for using a\nbalance board as the control device stems from Virtual Reality (VR) sickness;\neven small movements of your own body matching the motions seen on the screen\ndecrease the sensory conflict between vision and vestibular organs, which lies\nat the heart of most theories regarding the onset of VR sickness. To test the\nhypothesis that the balance board as a control method would be less sickening\nthan using joysticks, we designed a user study (N=32, 15 women) in which the\nparticipants drove a simulated differential drive robot in a virtual\nenvironment with either a Nintendo Wii Balance Board or joysticks. However, our\npre-registered main hypotheses were not supported; the joystick did not cause\nany more VR sickness on the participants than the balance board, and the board\nproved to be statistically significantly more difficult to use, both\nsubjectively and objectively. Analyzing the open-ended questions revealed these\nresults to be likely connected, meaning that the difficulty of use seemed to\naffect sickness; even unlimited training time before the test did not make the\nuse as easy as the familiar joystick. Thus, making the board easier to use is a\nkey to enable its potential; we present a few possibilities towards this goal.",

The proposed framework is designed to accommodate any\nnumber of feature vectors in the form of multi-mode tensor, thereby enabling to\ncapture the heterogeneity that may exist over user preferences, products, and\ncampaign strategies in a unified manner. To handle inter-dependency of tensor\nmodes, we introduce an online variational algorithm with a mean-field\napproximation.

    "abstract": "There has been substantial commentary on the role of cyberattacks,\nhacktivists, and the cybercrime underground in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nDrawing on a range of data sources, we argue that the widely-held narrative of\na cyberwar fought by committed 'hacktivists' linked to cybercrime groups is\nmisleading. We collected 281K web defacement attacks, 1.7M reflected DDoS\nattacks, and 441 announcements (with 58K replies) of a volunteer hacking\ndiscussion group for two months before and four months after the invasion. To\nenrich our quantitative analysis, we conducted interviews with website defacers\nwho were active in attacking sites in Russia and Ukraine during the period. Our\nfindings indicate that the conflict briefly but significantly caught the\nattention of the low-level cybercrime community, with notable shifts in the\ngeographical distribution of both defacement and DDoS attacks. However, the\nrole of these players in so-called cyberwarfare is minor, and they do not\nresemble the 'hacktivists' imagined in popular criminological accounts. Initial\nwaves of interest led to more defacers participating in attack campaigns, but\nrather than targeting critical infrastructure, there were mass attacks against\nrandom websites within '.ru' and '.ua'. We can find no evidence of high-profile\nactions of the kind hypothesised by the prevalent narrative. The much-vaunted\nrole of the 'IT Army of Ukraine' co-ordination group is mixed; the targets they\npromoted were seldom defaced although they were often subjected to DDoS\nattacks. Our main finding is that there was a clear loss of interest in\ncarrying out defacements and DDoS attacks after just a few weeks. Contrary to\nsome expert predictions, the cybercrime underground's involvement in the\nconflict appears to have been minor and short-lived; it is unlikely to escalate\nfurther.",

In particular, we view\nthe FTN signaling detection problem as a classification task, where the\nreceived signal is considered as an unlabeled class sample that belongs to a\nset of all possible classes samples. If we use an off-shelf classifier, then\nthe set of all possible classes samples belongs to an $N$-dimensional space,\nwhere $N$ is the transmission block length, which has a huge computational\ncomplexity. We propose a low-complexity classifier (LCC) that exploits the ISI\nstructure of FTN signaling to perform the classification task in $N_p \\ll\nN$-dimension space. The proposed LCC consists of two stages: 1) offline\npre-classification that constructs the labeled classes samples in the\n$N_p$-dimensional space and 2) online classification where the detection of the\nreceived samples occurs.

However, applying current contrastive learning approaches to\nmedical data without considering its domain-specific anatomical characteristics\nmay lead to visual representations that are inconsistent in appearance and\nsemantics. In this paper, we propose to improve visual representations of\nmedical images via anatomy-aware contrastive learning (AWCL), which\nincorporates anatomy information to augment the positive/negative pair sampling\nin a contrastive learning manner. The proposed approach is demonstrated for\nautomated fetal ultrasound imaging tasks, enabling the positive pairs from the\nsame or different ultrasound scans that are anatomically similar to be pulled\ntogether and thus improving the representation learning. We empirically\ninvestigate the effect of inclusion of anatomy information with coarse- and\nfine-grained granularity, for contrastive learning and find that learning with\nfine-grained anatomy information which preserves intra-class difference is more\neffective than its counterpart. We also analyze the impact of anatomy ratio on\nour AWCL framework and find that using more distinct but anatomically similar\nsamples to compose positive pairs results in better quality representations.\nExperiments on a large-scale fetal ultrasound dataset demonstrate that our\napproach is effective for learning representations that transfer well to three\nclinical downstream tasks, and achieves superior performance compared to\nImageNet supervised and the current state-of-the-art contrastive learning\nmethods.

We show that with autobidders\nonly, the price of anarchy of the first-price auction is $1/2$, and with both\nkinds of bidders, the price of anarchy degrades to about $0.457$ (the precise\nnumber is given by an optimization). These results complement the recent result\nby Jin and Lu [2022] showing that the price of anarchy of the first-price\nauction with traditional bidders only is $1 - 1/e^2$. We further investigate a\nsetting where the seller can utilize machine-learned advice to improve the\nefficiency of the auctions. There, we show that as the accuracy of the advice\nincreases, the price of anarchy improves smoothly from about $0.457$ to $1$.",

    "title": "Learning Visibility for Robust Dense Human Body Estimation",
    "abstract": "Estimating 3D human pose and shape from 2D images is a crucial yet\nchallenging task. While prior methods with model-based representations can\nperform reasonably well on whole-body images, they often fail when parts of the\nbody are occluded or outside the frame. Moreover, these results usually do not\nfaithfully capture the human silhouettes due to their limited representation\npower of deformable models (e.g., representing only the naked body). An\nalternative approach is to estimate dense vertices of a predefined template\nbody in the image space. Such representations are effective in localizing\nvertices within an image but cannot handle out-of-frame body parts. In this\nwork, we learn dense human body estimation that is robust to partial\nobservations. We explicitly model the visibility of human joints and vertices\nin the x, y, and z axes separately. The visibility in x and y axes help\ndistinguishing out-of-frame cases, and the visibility in depth axis corresponds\nto occlusions (either self-occlusions or occlusions by other objects). We\nobtain pseudo ground-truths of visibility labels from dense UV correspondences\nand train a neural network to predict visibility along with 3D coordinates. We\nshow that visibility can serve as 1) an additional signal to resolve depth\nordering ambiguities of self-occluded vertices and 2) a regularization term\nwhen fitting a human body model to the predictions. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple 3D human datasets demonstrate that visibility modeling significantly\nimproves the accuracy of human body estimation, especially for partial-body\ncases.

In\nparticular, the Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) algorithm has been\nstandardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for V2X resource\nscheduling in the out-of-coverage scenario. This paper analyzes the NR-V2X SPS\nthroughput from the MAC perspective, where the packet reception ratio (PRR) and\nhalf-duplex (HD) effect dominate. We first investigate the average throughput\nin the fully connected vehicular network, in which all the vehicles share the\nsame throughput. Subsequently, the average throughput as a function of distance\nin the partially connected vehicular network is analyzed. The Monte Carlo\nsimulation results show that increasing the resource keeping probability can\nimprove the average throughput. Meanwhile, in the partially connected network,\nthe lower resource keeping probability is prone to obtaining the higher\nthroughput gain by increasing the number of subchannels.",

    "abstract": "Public datasets have played a key role in advancing the state of the art in\nLicense Plate Recognition (LPR). Although dataset bias has been recognized as a\nsevere problem in the computer vision community, it has been largely overlooked\nin the LPR literature. LPR models are usually trained and evaluated separately\non each dataset. In this scenario, they have often proven robust in the dataset\nthey were trained in but showed limited performance in unseen ones. Therefore,\nthis work investigates the dataset bias problem in the LPR context. We\nperformed experiments on eight datasets, four collected in Brazil and four in\nmainland China, and observed that each dataset has a unique, identifiable\n\"signature\" since a lightweight classification model predicts the source\ndataset of a license plate (LP) image with more than 95% accuracy. In our\ndiscussion, we draw attention to the fact that most LPR models are probably\nexploiting such signatures to improve the results achieved in each dataset at\nthe cost of losing generalization capability. These results emphasize the\nimportance of evaluating LPR models in cross-dataset setups, as they provide a\nbetter indication of generalization (hence real-world performance) than\nwithin-dataset ones.",

    "abstract": "Training deep neural network (DNN) with noisy labels is practically\nchallenging since inaccurate labels severely degrade the generalization ability\nof DNN. Previous efforts tend to handle part or full data in a unified\ndenoising flow via identifying noisy data with a coarse small-loss criterion to\nmitigate the interference from noisy labels, ignoring the fact that the\ndifficulties of noisy samples are different, thus a rigid and unified data\nselection pipeline cannot tackle this problem well. In this paper, we first\npropose a coarse-to-fine robust learning method called CREMA, to handle noisy\ndata in a divide-and-conquer manner. In coarse-level, clean and noisy sets are\nfirstly separated in terms of credibility in a statistical sense. Since it is\npractically impossible to categorize all noisy samples correctly, we further\nprocess them in a fine-grained manner via modeling the credibility of each\nsample. Specifically, for the clean set, we deliberately design a memory-based\nmodulation scheme to dynamically adjust the contribution of each sample in\nterms of its historical credibility sequence during training, thus alleviating\nthe effect from noisy samples incorrectly grouped into the clean set.\nMeanwhile, for samples categorized into the noisy set, a selective label update\nstrategy is proposed to correct noisy labels while mitigating the problem of\ncorrection error. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmarks of\ndifferent modalities, including image classification (CIFAR, Clothing1M etc)\nand text recognition (IMDB), with either synthetic or natural semantic noises,\ndemonstrating the superiority and generality of CREMA.",

    "title": "The Effect of Modeling Human Rationality Level on Learning Rewards from  Multiple Feedback Types",
    "abstract": "When inferring reward functions from human behavior (be it demonstrations,\ncomparisons, physical corrections, or e-stops), it has proven useful to model\nthe human as making noisy-rational choices, with a \"rationality coefficient\"\ncapturing how much noise or entropy we expect to see in the human behavior.\nMany existing works have opted to fix this coefficient regardless of the type,\nor quality, of human feedback. However, in some settings, giving a\ndemonstration may be much more difficult than answering a comparison query. In\nthis case, we should expect to see more noise or suboptimality in\ndemonstrations than in comparisons, and should interpret the feedback\naccordingly. In this work, we advocate that grounding the rationality\ncoefficient in real data for each feedback type, rather than assuming a default\nvalue, has a significant positive effect on reward learning. We test this in\nexperiments with both simulated feedback, as well a user study. We find that\nwhen learning from a single feedback type, overestimating human rationality can\nhave dire effects on reward accuracy and regret. Further, we find that the\nrationality level affects the informativeness of each feedback type:\nsurprisingly, demonstrations are not always the most informative -- when the\nhuman acts very suboptimally, comparisons actually become more informative,\neven when the rationality level is the same for both. Moreover, when the robot\ngets to decide which feedback type to ask for, it gets a large advantage from\naccurately modeling the rationality level of each type. Ultimately, our results\nemphasize the importance of paying attention to the assumed rationality level,\nnot only when learning from a single feedback type, but especially when agents\nactively learn from multiple feedback types.",

    "title": "Hierarchical Perceptual Noise Injection for Social Media Fingerprint  Privacy Protection",
    "abstract": "Billions of people are sharing their daily life images on social media every\nday. However, their biometric information (e.g., fingerprint) could be easily\nstolen from these images. The threat of fingerprint leakage from social media\nraises a strong desire for anonymizing shared images while maintaining image\nqualities, since fingerprints act as a lifelong individual biometric password.\nTo guard the fingerprint leakage, adversarial attack emerges as a solution by\nadding imperceptible perturbations on images. However, existing works are\neither weak in black-box transferability or appear unnatural. Motivated by\nvisual perception hierarchy (i.e., high-level perception exploits model-shared\nsemantics that transfer well across models while low-level perception extracts\nprimitive stimulus and will cause high visual sensitivities given suspicious\nstimulus), we propose FingerSafe, a hierarchical perceptual protective noise\ninjection framework to address the mentioned problems. For black-box\ntransferability, we inject protective noises on fingerprint orientation field\nto perturb the model-shared high-level semantics (i.e., fingerprint ridges).\nConsidering visual naturalness, we suppress the low-level local contrast\nstimulus by regularizing the response of Lateral Geniculate Nucleus. Our\nFingerSafe is the first to provide feasible fingerprint protection in both\ndigital (up to 94.12%) and realistic scenarios (Twitter and Facebook, up to\n68.75%).

Though recent success in the federated\nrecommender system, several vital challenges remain to be addressed: (i) The\nmajority of federated recommendation models only consider the model performance\nand the privacy-preserving ability, while ignoring the optimization of the\ncommunication process; (ii) Most of the federated recommenders are designed for\nheterogeneous systems, causing unfairness problems during the federation\nprocess; (iii) The personalization techniques have been less explored in many\nfederated recommender systems.\nIn this paper, we propose a Communication efficient and Fair personalized\nFederated personalized Sequential Recommendation algorithm (CF-FedSR) to tackle\nthese challenges.

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) samples with pathological annotations are difficult\nto obtain. As a result, the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithms are\ntrained on small datasets (e.g., LIDC-IDRI with 1,018 samples), limiting their\naccuracies and reliability. In the past five years, several works have tailored\nfor unsupervised representations of CT lesions via two-dimensional (2D) and\nthree-dimensional (3D) self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms. The 2D\nalgorithms have difficulty capturing 3D information, and existing 3D algorithms\nare computationally heavy. Light-weight 3D SSL remains the boundary to explore.\nIn this paper, we propose the spiral contrastive learning (SCL), which yields\n3D representations in a computationally efficient manner. SCL first transforms\n3D lesions to the 2D plane using an information-preserving spiral\ntransformation, and then learn transformation-invariant features using 2D\ncontrastive learning. For the augmentation, we consider natural image\naugmentations and medical image augmentations. We evaluate SCL by training a\nclassification head upon the embedding layer. Experimental results show that\nSCL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on LIDC-IDRI (89.72%), LNDb (82.09%) and\nTianChi (90.16%) for unsupervised representation learning.

    "abstract": "In recent years, several works have adopted the convolutional neural network\n(CNN) to diagnose the avascular necrosis of the femoral head (AVNFH) based on\nX-ray images or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, due to the tissue\noverlap, X-ray images are difficult to provide fine-grained features for early\ndiagnosis. MRI, on the other hand, has a long imaging time, is more expensive,\nmaking it impractical in mass screening. Computed tomography (CT) shows\nlayer-wise tissues, is faster to image, and is less costly than MRI. However,\nto our knowledge, there is no work on CT-based automated diagnosis of AVNFH. In\nthis work, we collected and labeled a large-scale dataset for AVNFH ranking. In\naddition, existing end-to-end CNNs only yields the classification result and\nare difficult to provide more information for doctors in diagnosis. To address\nthis issue, we propose the structure regularized attentive network (SRANet),\nwhich is able to highlight the necrotic regions during classification based on\npatch attention. SRANet extracts features in chunks of images, obtains weight\nvia the attention mechanism to aggregate the features, and constrains them by a\nstructural regularizer with prior knowledge to improve the generalization.\nSRANet was evaluated on our AVNFH-CT dataset. Experimental results show that\nSRANet is superior to CNNs for AVNFH classification, moreover, it can localize\nlesions and provide more information to assist doctors in diagnosis.

    "abstract": "Long-term vertebral fractures severely affect the life quality of patients,\ncausing kyphotic, lumbar deformity and even paralysis. Computed tomography (CT)\nis a common clinical examination to screen for this disease at early stages.\nHowever, the faint radiological appearances and unspecific symptoms lead to a\nhigh risk of missed diagnosis. In particular, the mild fractures and normal\ncontrols are quite difficult to distinguish for deep learning models and\ninexperienced doctors. In this paper, we argue that reinforcing the faint\nfracture features to encourage the inter-class separability is the key to\nimproving the accuracy. Motivated by this, we propose a supervised contrastive\nlearning based model to estimate Genent's Grade of vertebral fracture with CT\nscans. The supervised contrastive learning, as an auxiliary task, narrows the\ndistance of features within the same class while pushing others away, which\nenhances the model's capability of capturing subtle features of vertebral\nfractures. Considering the lack of datasets in this field, we construct a\ndatabase including 208 samples annotated by experienced radiologists. Our\nmethod has a specificity of 99\\% and a sensitivity of 85\\% in binary\nclassification, and a macio-F1 of 77\\% in multi-classification, indicating that\ncontrastive learning significantly improves the accuracy of vertebrae fracture\nscreening, especially for the mild fractures and normal controls.

    "abstract": "Forming a microgrid on a distribution system with large scale outage after a\nsevere weather event is emerging as a viable solution to improve resiliency at\nthe distribution level. This option becomes more attractive when the\ndistribution system has high levels of distributed PV. The management of such\nfeeder-level microgrid has however many challenges, such as limited resources\nthat can be deployed on the feeder quickly, and the limited real-time\nmonitoring and control on the distribution system. Effective use of the\ndistributed PV is also challenging as they are not monitored and controlled. To\nhandle these challenges, the paper proposes a 2-stage hierarchical energy\nmanagement scheme to securely operate these feeder level micorgrids. The first\nstage of the scheme solves a sequential rolling optimization problem to\noptimally schedule the main resources (such as a mobile diesel generator and\nbattery storage unit). The second stage adopts a dispatching scheme for the\nmain resources to adjust the stage-1 set-points closer to real- time. The\nproposed scheme has unique features to assure that the scheme is robust under\nhighly varying operating conditions with limited system observability: (i) an\ninnovative PV forecast error adjustment and a dynamic reserve adjustment scheme\nto handle the extreme uncertainty on PV power output, and (ii) an intelligent\nfuel management scheme to assure that the resources are utilized optimally over\nthe multiple days of the restoration period. The proposed algorithm is tested\non sample system with real-time data. The results show that the proposed scheme\nperforms well in maximizing service to loads by effective use of all the\nresources and by properly taking into account the challenging operating\nconditions.",

    "abstract": "Sampling the phase space of molecular systems -- and, more generally, of\ncomplex systems effectively modeled by stochastic differential equations -- is\na crucial modeling step in many fields, from protein folding to materials\ndiscovery. These problems are often multiscale in nature: they can be described\nin terms of low-dimensional effective free energy surfaces parametrized by a\nsmall number of \"slow\" reaction coordinates; the remaining \"fast\" degrees of\nfreedom populate an equilibrium measure on the reaction coordinate values.\nSampling procedures for such problems are used to estimate effective free\nenergy differences as well as ensemble averages with respect to the conditional\nequilibrium distributions; these latter averages lead to closures for effective\nreduced dynamic models. Over the years, enhanced sampling techniques coupled\nwith molecular simulation have been developed. An intriguing analogy arises\nwith the field of Machine Learning (ML), where Generative Adversarial Networks\ncan produce high dimensional samples from low dimensional probability\ndistributions. This sample generation returns plausible high dimensional space\nrealizations of a model state, from information about its low-dimensional\nrepresentation. In this work, we present an approach that couples physics-based\nsimulations and biasing methods for sampling conditional distributions with\nML-based conditional generative adversarial networks for the same task. The\n\"coarse descriptors\" on which we condition the fine scale realizations can\neither be known a priori, or learned through nonlinear dimensionality\nreduction.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the problem of string-based molecular\ngeneration via variational autoencoders (VAEs) that have served a popular\ngenerative approach for various tasks in artificial intelligence. We propose a\nsimple, yet effective idea to improve the performance of VAE for the task. Our\nmain idea is to maintain multiple decoders while sharing a single encoder,\ni.e., it is a type of ensemble techniques. Here, we first found that training\neach decoder independently may not be effective as the bias of the ensemble\ndecoder increases severely under its auto-regressive inference. To maintain\nboth small bias and variance of the ensemble model, our proposed technique is\ntwo-fold: (a) a different latent variable is sampled for each decoder (from\nestimated mean and variance offered by the shared encoder) to encourage diverse\ncharacteristics of decoders and (b) a collaborative loss is used during\ntraining to control the aggregated quality of decoders using different latent\nvariables. In our experiments, the proposed VAE model particularly performs\nwell for generating a sample from out-of-domain distribution.",

However, in order to deploy them in real systems, it is of vital\nimportance to guarantee that the system will remain safe during online training\nand execution. We therefore need safe online learning frameworks able to\nautonomously reason about whether the current information at their disposal is\nenough to ensure safety or, in contrast, new measurements are required. In this\npaper, we present a framework consisting of two parts: first, an\nout-of-distribution detection mechanism actively collecting measurements when\nneeded to guarantee that at least one safety backup direction is always\navailable for use; and second, a Gaussian Process-based probabilistic\nsafety-critical controller that ensures the system stays safe at all times with\nhigh probability. Our method exploits model knowledge through the use of\nControl Barrier Functions, and collects measurements from the stream of online\ndata in an event-triggered fashion to guarantee recursive feasibility of the\nlearned safety-critical controller. This, in turn, allows us to provide formal\nresults of forward invariance of a safe set with high probability, even in a\npriori unexplored regions.

    "abstract": "Survival analysis, the art of time-to-event modeling, plays an important role\nin clinical treatment decisions. Recently, continuous time models built from\nneural ODEs have been proposed for survival analysis. However, the training of\nneural ODEs is slow due to the high computational complexity of neural ODE\nsolvers. Here, we propose an efficient alternative for flexible continuous time\nmodels, called Survival Mixture Density Networks (Survival MDNs). Survival MDN\napplies an invertible positive function to the output of Mixture Density\nNetworks (MDNs). While MDNs produce flexible real-valued distributions, the\ninvertible positive function maps the model into the time-domain while\npreserving a tractable density. Using four datasets, we show that Survival MDN\nperforms better than, or similarly to continuous and discrete time baselines on\nconcordance, integrated Brier score and integrated binomial log-likelihood.\nMeanwhile, Survival MDNs are also faster than ODE-based models and circumvent\nbinning issues in discrete models.",

    "abstract": "My goal in this paper is twofold: to study how well deep models can\nunderstand the images generated by DALL-E 2 and Midjourney, and to\nquantitatively evaluate these generative models. Two sets of generated images\nare collected for object recognition and visual question answering (VQA) tasks.\nOn object recognition, the best model, out of 10 state-of-the-art object\nrecognition models, achieves about 60\\% and 80\\% top-1 and top-5 accuracy,\nrespectively. These numbers are much lower than the best accuracy on the\nImageNet dataset (91\\% and 99\\%). On VQA, the OFA model scores 77.3\\% on\nanswering 241 binary questions across 50 images. This model scores 94.7\\% on\nthe binary VQA-v2 dataset. Humans are able to recognize the generated images\nand answer questions on them easily. We conclude that a) deep models struggle\nto understand the generated content, and may do better after fine-tuning, and\nb) there is a large distribution shift between the generated images and the\nreal photographs. The distribution shift appears to be category-dependent. Data\nis available at:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1n2nCiaXtYJRRF2R73-LNE3zggeU_HeH0/view?usp=sharing.",

Typical multi-fingered soft grippers recently\nshowcased for aerial grasping are highly dependent on the direction of the\ntarget object for successful grasping.

In particular, the paper investigates the design,\nfabrication, and experimental verification of a novel, highly integrated,\nmodular, sensor-rich, universal jamming gripper specifically designed for\naerial applications. Leveraging recent developments in particle jamming and\nsoft granular materials, the presented gripper produces a substantial holding\nforce while being very lightweight, energy-efficient and only requiring a low\nactivation force. We show that the holding force can be improved by up to 50%\nby adding an additive to the membrane's silicone mixture. The experiments show\nthat our lightweight gripper can develop up to 15N of holding force with an\nactivation force as low as 2.5N, even without geometric interlocking. Finally,\na pick and release task is performed under real-world conditions by mounting\nthe gripper onto a multi-copter.

Recently, works based\non pixel-aligned implicit function (PIFu) have made a big step and achieved\nstate-of-the-art fidelity on image-based 3D human digitization. However, the\ntraining of PIFu relies heavily on expensive and limited 3D ground truth data\n(i.e. synthetic data), thus hindering its generalization to more diverse real\nworld images. In this work, we propose an end-to-end self-supervised network\nnamed SelfPIFu to utilize abundant and diverse in-the-wild images, resulting in\nlargely improved reconstructions when tested on unconstrained in-the-wild\nimages. At the core of SelfPIFu is the depth-guided volume-/surface-aware\nsigned distance fields (SDF) learning, which enables self-supervised learning\nof a PIFu without access to GT mesh. The whole framework consists of a normal\nestimator, a depth estimator, and a SDF-based PIFu and better utilizes extra\ndepth GT during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our self-supervised framework and the superiority of using depth as input.\nOn synthetic data, our Intersection-Over-Union (IoU) achieves to 93.5%, 18%\nhigher compared with PIFuHD.

To achieve\nthis, we first detect objects and then measure their semantic and spatial\ndistances to construct an object graph, which is then represented by a graph\nneural network (GNN) for refining visual CNN features for objects. However,\nrefining CNN features and detection results of every object are inefficient and\nmay not be necessary, as that include correct predictions with low\nuncertainties. Therefore, we propose to handle uncertain objects by not only\ntransferring the representation from certain objects (sources) to uncertain\nobjects (targets) over the directed graph, but also improving CNN features only\non objects regarded as uncertain with their representational outputs from the\nGNN. Furthermore, we calculate a training loss by giving larger weights on\nuncertain objects, to concentrate on improving uncertain object predictions\nwhile maintaining high performances on certain objects.

    "abstract": "Distributional semantics, the quantitative study of meaning variation and\nchange through corpus collocations, is currently one of the most productive\nresearch areas in computational linguistics. The wider availability of big data\nand of reproducible algorithms for analysis has boosted its application to\nliving languages in recent years. But can we use distributional semantics to\nstudy a language with such a limited corpus as ancient Greek? And can this\napproach tell us something about such vexed questions in classical studies as\nthe language and composition of the Homeric poems? Our paper will compare the\nsemantic flexibility of formulae involving transitive verbs in archaic Greek\nepic to similar verb phrases in a non-formulaic corpus, in order to detect\nunique patterns of variation in formulae. To address this, we present AGVaLex,\na computational valency lexicon for ancient Greek automatically extracted from\nthe Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank. The lexicon contains quantitative\ncorpus-driven morphological, syntactic and lexical information about verbs and\ntheir arguments, such as objects, subjects, and prepositional phrases, and has\na wide range of applications for the study of the language of ancient Greek\nauthors.",

Today\nthis system has been developed for several language pairs that involve English\nas either the source or target word and deployed in several places like Google\nTranslate and chatbots. However, there is very little research done in the\nfield of Indic languages transliterated to other Indic languages.

This paper shows a model that can perform\ntransliteration between any pair among the following five languages - English,\nHindi, Bengali, Kannada and Tamil. It is applicable in scenarios where language\nis a barrier to communication in any written task. The model beats the\nstate-of-the-art (for all pairs among the five mentioned languages - English,\nHindi, Bengali, Kannada, and Tamil) and achieves a top-1 accuracy score of\n80.7%, about 29.5% higher than the best current results.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised question answering is an attractive task due to its independence\non labeled data. Previous works usually make use of heuristic rules as well as\npre-trained models to construct data and train QA models. However, most of\nthese works regard named entity (NE) as the only answer type, which ignores the\nhigh diversity of answers in the real world. To tackle this problem, we propose\na novel unsupervised method by diversifying answers, named DiverseQA.\nSpecifically, the proposed method is composed of three modules: data\nconstruction, data augmentation and denoising filter. Firstly, the data\nconstruction module extends the extracted named entity into a longer sentence\nconstituent as the new answer span to construct a QA dataset with diverse\nanswers. Secondly, the data augmentation module adopts an answer-type dependent\ndata augmentation process via adversarial training in the embedding level.\nThirdly, the denoising filter module is designed to alleviate the noise in the\nconstructed data. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method\noutperforms previous unsupervised models on five benchmark datasets, including\nSQuADv1.1, NewsQA, TriviaQA, BioASQ, and DuoRC.

    "abstract": "The spread of online misinformation is increasingly perceived as a major\nproblem for societal cohesion and democracy. Much attention has focused on the\nrole of social media as a vector of misinformation. The role of political\nleaders has attracted less research attention, even though leaders demonstrably\ninfluence media coverage and public opinion, and even though politicians who\n\"speak their mind\" are perceived by segments of the public as authentic and\nhonest even if their statements are unsupported by evidence or facts. Here we\nshow that in the last decade, politicians' concept of truth has undergone a\ndistinct shift, with authentic but evidence-free belief-speaking becoming more\nprominent and more differentiated from evidence-based truth seeking. We analyze\ncommunications by members of the U.S. Congress on Twitter between 2011 and 2022\nand show that political speech has fractured into two distinct components\nrelated to belief-speaking and evidence-based truth-seeking, respectively, and\nthat belief-speaking is related to spreading of untrustworthy information. We\nshow that in tweets by conservative members of Congress, an increase in\nbelief-speaking of 10% is associated with a decrease of 6.8 points of quality\n(using the NewsGuard scoring system) in the sources shared in a tweet. In\naddition, we find that an increase of belief-speaking language by 10% in the\nshared articles themselves is associated with a drop in NewsGuard score of 4.3\npoints for members of both parties. By contrast, increase in truth-seeking\nlanguage is associated with a slight increase in quality of sources. The\nresults support the hypothesis that the current flood of misinformation in\npolitical discourse is in part driven by a new understanding of truth and\nhonesty that has replaced reliance on evidence with the invocation of\nsubjective belief.",

    "abstract": "User simulators (USs) are commonly used to train task-oriented dialogue\nsystems (DSs) via reinforcement learning. The interactions often take place on\nsemantic level for efficiency, but there is still a gap from semantic actions\nto natural language, which causes a mismatch between training and deployment\nenvironment. Incorporating a natural language generation (NLG) module with USs\nduring training can partly deal with this problem. However, since the policy\nand NLG of USs are optimised separately, these simulated user utterances may\nnot be natural enough in a given context. In this work, we propose a generative\ntransformer-based user simulator (GenTUS). GenTUS consists of an\nencoder-decoder structure, which means it can optimise both the user policy and\nnatural language generation jointly. GenTUS generates both semantic actions and\nnatural language utterances, preserving interpretability and enhancing language\nvariation. In addition, by representing the inputs and outputs as word\nsequences and by using a large pre-trained language model we can achieve\ngeneralisability in feature representation. We evaluate GenTUS with automatic\nmetrics and human evaluation. Our results show that GenTUS generates more\nnatural language and is able to transfer to an unseen ontology in a zero-shot\nfashion. In addition, its behaviour can be further shaped with reinforcement\nlearning opening the door to training specialised user simulators.",

    "abstract": "Decisions about sharing personal information are not trivial, since there are\nmany legitimate and important purposes for such data collection, but often the\ncollected data can reveal sensitive information about individuals.\nPrivacy-preserving technologies, such as differential privacy (DP), can be\nemployed to protect the privacy of individuals and, furthermore, provide\nmathematically sound guarantees on the maximum privacy risk. However, they can\nonly support informed privacy decisions, if individuals understand the provided\nprivacy guarantees. This article proposes a novel approach for communicating\nprivacy guarantees to support individuals in their privacy decisions when\nsharing data. For this, we adopt risk communication formats from the medical\ndomain in conjunction with a model for privacy guarantees of DP to create\nquantitative privacy risk notifications. We conducted a crowd-sourced study\nwith 343 participants to evaluate how well our notifications conveyed the\nprivacy risk information and how confident participants were about their own\nunderstanding of the privacy risk. Our findings suggest that these new\nnotifications can communicate the objective information similarly well to\ncurrently used qualitative notifications, but left individuals less confident\nin their understanding. We also discovered that several of our notifications\nand the currently used qualitative notification disadvantage individuals with\nlow numeracy: these individuals appear overconfident compared to their actual\nunderstanding of the associated privacy risks and are, therefore, less likely\nto seek the needed additional information before an informed decision. The\npromising results allow for multiple directions in future research, for\nexample, adding visual aids or tailoring privacy risk communication to\ncharacteristics of the individuals.",

In this paper, we propose a novel weakly\nsupervised log anomaly detection framework, named LogLG, to explore the\nsemantic connections among keywords from sequences. Specifically, we design an\niterative process, where the keywords of unlabeled logs are first extracted to\nconstruct a log-event graph in each iteration. Then, we build a subgraph\nannotator to alter the purpose of generating pseudo labels for unlabeled log\nsequences into annotating corresponding log-subgraphs. To ameliorate the\nannotation quality, we adopt a self-supervised task to pre-train a subgraph\nannotator. After that, a log anomaly detection model is trained with the pseudo\nlabels generated by the subgraph annotator. Conditioned on the classification\nresults, we re-extract the keywords from the classified log sequences and\nupdate the log-event graph for the next iteration. Experiments on five\nbenchmarks validate the effectiveness of LogLG for detecting anomalies on\nunlabeled log data, and demonstrate that LogLG, as the state-of-the-art weakly\nsupervised method, achieves significant improvements compared to existing\nsemi-supervised methods.",

    "abstract": "Navigation in varied and dynamic indoor environments remains a complex task\nfor autonomous mobile platforms. Especially when conditions worsen, typical\nsensor modalities may fail to operate optimally and subsequently provide inapt\ninput for safe navigation control. In this study, we present an approach for\nthe navigation of a dynamic indoor environment with a mobile platform with a\nsingle or several sonar sensors using a layered control system. These sensors\ncan operate in conditions such as rain, fog, dust, or dirt. The different\ncontrol layers, such as collision avoidance and corridor following behavior,\nare activated based on acoustic flow queues in the fusion of the sonar images.\nThe novelty of this work is allowing these sensors to be freely positioned on\nthe mobile platform and providing the framework for designing the optimal\nnavigational outcome based on a zoning system around the mobile platform.\nPresented in this paper is the acoustic flow model used, as well as the design\nof the layered controller. Next to validation in simulation, an implementation\nis presented and validated in a real office environment using a real mobile\nplatform with one, two, or three sonar sensors in real time with 2D navigation.\nMultiple sensor layouts were validated in both the simulation and real\nexperiments to demonstrate that the modular approach for the controller and\nsensor fusion works optimally.

    "abstract": "Systems for estimating the six-degrees-of-freedom human body pose have been\nimproving for over two decades. Technologies such as motion capture cameras,\nadvanced gaming peripherals and more recently both deep learning techniques and\nvirtual reality systems have shown impressive results. However, most systems\nthat provide high accuracy and high precision are expensive and not easy to\noperate. Recently, research has been carried out to estimate the human body\npose using the HTC Vive virtual reality system. This system shows accurate\nresults while keeping the cost under a 1000 USD. This system uses an optical\napproach. Two transmitter devices emit infrared pulses and laser planes are\ntracked by use of photo diodes on receiver hardware. A system using these\ntransmitter devices combined with low-cost custom-made receiver hardware was\ndeveloped previously but requires manual measurement of the position and\norientation of the transmitter devices. These manual measurements can be time\nconsuming, prone to error and not possible in particular setups. We propose an\nalgorithm to automatically calibrate the poses of the transmitter devices in\nany chosen environment with custom receiver/calibration hardware. Results show\nthat the calibration works in a variety of setups while being more accurate\nthan what manual measurements would allow. Furthermore, the calibration\nmovement and speed has no noticeable influence on the precision of the results.",

    "abstract": "Accurate, detailed, and timely crop type mapping is a very valuable\ninformation for the institutions in order to create more accurate policies\naccording to the needs of the citizens. In the last decade, the amount of\navailable data dramatically increased, whether it can come from Remote Sensing\n(using Copernicus Sentinel-2 data) or directly from the farmers (providing\nin-situ crop information throughout the years and information on crop\nrotation). Nevertheless, the majority of the studies are restricted to the use\nof one modality (Remote Sensing data or crop rotation) and never fuse the Earth\nObservation data with domain knowledge like crop rotations. Moreover, when they\nuse Earth Observation data they are mainly restrained to one year of data, not\ntaking into account the past years. In this context, we propose to tackle a\nland use and crop type classification task using three data types, by using a\nHierarchical Deep Learning algorithm modeling the crop rotations like a\nlanguage model, the satellite signals like a speech signal and using the crop\ndistribution as additional context vector. We obtained very promising results\ncompared to classical approaches with significant performances, increasing the\nAccuracy by 5.1 points in a 28-class setting (.948), and the micro-F1 by 9.6\npoints in a 10-class setting (.887) using only a set of crop of interests\nselected by an expert.

    "abstract": "There are three generic services in 5G: enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB),\nultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), and massive machine-type\ncommunications (mMTC). To guarantee the performance of heterogeneous services,\nnetwork slicing is proposed to allocate resources to different services.\nNetwork slicing is typically done in an orthogonal multiple access (OMA)\nfashion, which means different services are allocated non-interfering\nresources. However, as the number of users grows, OMA-based slicing is not\nalways optimal, and a non-orthogonal scheme may achieve a better performance.\nThis work aims to analyse the performances of different slicing schemes in\nuplink, and a promising scheme based on rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)\nis studied. RSMA can provide a more flexible decoding order and theoretically\nhas the largest achievable rate region than OMA and non-orthogonal multiple\naccess (NOMA) without time-sharing. Hence, RSMA has the potential to increase\nthe rate of users requiring different services. In addition, it is not\nnecessary to decode the two split streams of one user successively, so RSMA\nlets suitable users split messages and designs an appropriate decoding order\ndepending on the service requirements. This work shows that for network slicing\nRSMA can outperform NOMA counterpart, and obtain significant gains over OMA in\nsome region.",

However, the benefits of ensemble in the context of LTs will be diluted\nsince ensemble does not directly lead to stronger sparse subnetworks, but\nleverages their predictions for a better decision. In this work, we first\nobserve that directly averaging the weights of the adjacent learned subnetworks\nsignificantly boosts the performance of LTs. Encouraged by this observation, we\nfurther propose an alternative way to perform an 'ensemble' over the\nsubnetworks identified by iterative magnitude pruning via a simple\ninterpolating strategy. We call our method Lottery Pools. In contrast to the\nnaive ensemble which brings no performance gains to each single subnetwork,\nLottery Pools yields much stronger sparse subnetworks than the original LTs\nwithout requiring any extra training or inference cost. Across various modern\narchitectures on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, we show that our method achieves\nsignificant performance gains in both, in-distribution and out-of-distribution\nscenarios.

    "abstract": "Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable performance gains\nacross numerous downstream tasks in natural language understanding. Various\nChinese PLMs have been successively proposed for learning better Chinese\nlanguage representation. However, most current models use Chinese characters as\ninputs and are not able to encode semantic information contained in Chinese\nwords. While recent pre-trained models incorporate both words and characters\nsimultaneously, they usually suffer from deficient semantic interactions and\nfail to capture the semantic relation between words and characters. To address\nthe above issues, we propose a simple yet effective PLM CLOWER, which adopts\nthe Contrastive Learning Over Word and charactER representations. In\nparticular, CLOWER implicitly encodes the coarse-grained information (i.e.,\nwords) into the fine-grained representations (i.e., characters) through\ncontrastive learning on multi-grained information. CLOWER is of great value in\nrealistic scenarios since it can be easily incorporated into any existing\nfine-grained based PLMs without modifying the production pipelines.Extensive\nexperiments conducted on a range of downstream tasks demonstrate the superior\nperformance of CLOWER over several state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Users' search tasks have become increasingly complicated, requiring multiple\nqueries and interactions with the results. Recent studies have demonstrated\nthat modeling the historical user behaviors in a session can help understand\nthe current search intent. Existing context-aware ranking models primarily\nencode the current session sequence (from the first behavior to the current\nquery) and compute the ranking score using the high-level representations.\nHowever, there is usually some noise in the current session sequence (useless\nbehaviors for inferring the search intent) that may affect the quality of the\nencoded representations. To help the encoding of the current user behavior\nsequence, we propose to use a decoder and the information of future sequences\nand a supplemental query. Specifically, we design three generative tasks that\ncan help the encoder to infer the actual search intent: (1) predicting future\nqueries, (2) predicting future clicked documents, and (3) predicting a\nsupplemental query. We jointly learn the ranking task with these generative\ntasks using an encoder-decoder structured approach. Extensive experiments on\ntwo public search logs demonstrate that our model outperforms all existing\nbaselines, and the designed generative tasks can actually help the ranking\ntask.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have underpinned the recent breakthroughs in\ncomputer vision. However, designing the architectures of ViTs is laborious and\nheavily relies on expert knowledge. To automate the design process and\nincorporate deployment flexibility, one-shot neural architecture search\ndecouples the supernet training and architecture specialization for diverse\ndeployment scenarios. To cope with an enormous number of sub-networks in the\nsupernet, existing methods treat all architectures equally important and\nrandomly sample some of them in each update step during training. During\narchitecture search, these methods focus on finding architectures on the Pareto\nfrontier of performance and resource consumption, which forms a gap between\ntraining and deployment. In this paper, we devise a simple yet effective\nmethod, called FocusFormer, to bridge such a gap. To this end, we propose to\nlearn an architecture sampler to assign higher sampling probabilities to those\narchitectures on the Pareto frontier under different resource constraints\nduring supernet training, making them sufficiently optimized and hence\nimproving their performance. During specialization, we can directly use the\nwell-trained architecture sampler to obtain accurate architectures satisfying\nthe given resource constraint, which significantly improves the search\nefficiency. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet show that our\nFocusFormer is able to improve the performance of the searched architectures\nwhile significantly reducing the search cost.

The notion of an $f$-resilient message\nblock is defined to capture the fundamental communication pattern for knowledge\ntransfer. This pattern may involve null messages in addition to explicit\nmessages, and hence, it provides a fault-tolerant extension of the classic\nnotion of a message-chain. Based on the above, we provide tight necessary and\nsufficient characterizations of the generalized communication patterns,\nincluding actual messages and null messages, that can serve to solve the\ndistributed tasks of (nice-run) Signalling and Ordered Response.",

    "title": "A Quinary Coding and Matrix Structure-based Channel Hopping Algorithm  for Blind Rendezvous in Cognitive Radio Networks",
    "abstract": "The multi-channel blind rendezvous problem in distributed cognitive radio\nnetworks (DCRNs) refers to how users in the network can hop to the same channel\nat the same time slot without any prior knowledge (i.e., each user is unaware\nof other users' information). The channel hopping (CH) technique is a typical\nsolution to this blind rendezvous problem. In this paper, we propose a quinary\ncoding and matrix structure-based CH algorithm called QCMS-CH. The QCMS-CH\nalgorithm can guarantee the rendezvous of users using only one cognitive radio\nin the scenario of the asynchronous clock (i.e., arbitrary time drift between\nthe users), heterogeneous channels (i.e., the available channel sets of users\nare distinct), and symmetric role (i.e., all users play a same role). The\nQCMS-CH algorithm first represents a randomly selected channel (denoted by R)\nas a fixed-length quaternary number. Then it encodes the quaternary number into\na quinary bootstrapping sequence according to a carefully designed\nquaternary-quinary coding table with the prefix \"R00\". Finally, it builds a CH\nmatrix column by column according to the bootstrapping sequence and six\ndifferent types of elaborately generated subsequences. The user can access the\nCH matrix row by row and accordingly perform its channel hopping to attempt to\nrendezvous with other users. We prove the correctness of QCMS-CH and derive an\nupper bound on its Maximum Time-to-Rendezvous (MTTR). Simulation results show\nthat the QCMS-CH algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of the\nMTTR and the Expected Time-to-Rendezvous (ETTR).",

    "abstract": "The globalization of the Integrated Circuit (IC) market is attracting an\never-growing number of partners, while remarkably lengthening the supply chain.\nThereby, security concerns, such as those imposed by functional Reverse\nEngineering (RE), have become quintessential. RE leads to disclosure of\nconfidential information to competitors, potentially enabling the theft of\nintellectual property. Traditional functional RE methods analyze a given\ngate-level netlist through employing pattern matching towards reconstructing\nthe underlying basic blocks, and hence, reverse engineer the circuit's\nfunction.\nIn this work, we are the first to demonstrate that applying Approximate\nComputing (AxC) principles to circuits significantly improves the resiliency\nagainst RE. This is attributed to the increased complexity in the underlying\npattern-matching process. The resiliency remains effective even for Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) that are presently one of the most powerful\nstate-of-the-art techniques in functional RE. Using AxC, we demonstrate a\nsubstantial reduction in GNN average classification accuracy-- from 98% to a\nmere 53%. To surmount the challenges introduced by AxC in RE, we propose the\nhighly promising AppGNN platform, which enables GNNs (still being trained on\nexact circuits) to: (i) perform accurate classifications, and (ii) reverse\nengineer the circuit functionality, notwithstanding the applied approximation\ntechnique. AppGNN accomplishes this by implementing a novel graph-based node\nsampling approach that mimics generic approximation methodologies, requiring\nzero knowledge of the targeted approximation type.\nWe perform an extensive evaluation and show that, using our method, we can\nimprove the classification accuracy from 53% to 81% when classifying\napproximate adder circuits that have been generated using evolutionary\nalgorithms, which our method is oblivious of.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial examples can be used to maliciously and covertly change a model's\nprediction. It is known that an adversarial example designed for one model can\ntransfer to other models as well. This poses a major threat because it means\nthat attackers can target systems in a blackbox manner.\nIn the domain of transferability, researchers have proposed ways to make\nattacks more transferable and to make models more robust to transferred\nexamples. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no works which\npropose a means for ranking the transferability of an adversarial example in\nthe perspective of a blackbox attacker. This is an important task because an\nattacker is likely to use only a select set of examples, and therefore will\nwant to select the samples which are most likely to transfer.\nIn this paper we suggest a method for ranking the transferability of\nadversarial examples without access to the victim's model. To accomplish this,\nwe define and estimate the expected transferability of a sample given limited\ninformation about the victim. We also explore practical scenarios: where the\nadversary can select the best sample to attack and where the adversary must use\na specific sample but can choose different perturbations. Through our\nexperiments, we found that our ranking method can increase an attacker's\nsuccess rate by up to 80% compared to the baseline (random selection without\nranking).",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm for training machine learning\nmodels using possibly private data available at edge devices. The distributed\noperation of FL gives rise to challenges that are not encountered in\ncentralized machine learning, including the need to preserve the privacy of the\nlocal datasets, and the communication load due to the repeated exchange of\nupdated models. These challenges are often tackled individually via techniques\nthat induce some distortion on the updated models, e.g., local differential\nprivacy (LDP) mechanisms and lossy compression. In this work we propose a\nmethod coined joint privacy enhancement and quantization (JoPEQ), which jointly\nimplements lossy compression and privacy enhancement in FL settings. In\nparticular, JoPEQ utilizes vector quantization based on random lattice, a\nuniversal compression technique whose byproduct distortion is statistically\nequivalent to additive noise. This distortion is leveraged to enhance privacy\nby augmenting the model updates with dedicated multivariate privacy preserving\nnoise. We show that JoPEQ simultaneously quantizes data according to a required\nbit-rate while holding a desired privacy level, without notably affecting the\nutility of the learned model. This is shown via analytical LDP guarantees,\ndistortion and convergence bounds derivation, and numerical studies. Finally,\nwe empirically assert that JoPEQ demolishes common attacks known to exploit\nprivacy leakage.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural network based object detectors are continuously evolving and are\nused in a multitude of applications, each having its own set of requirements.\nWhile safety-critical applications need high accuracy and reliability,\nlow-latency tasks need resource and energy-efficient networks. Real-time\ndetectors, which are a necessity in high-impact real-world applications, are\ncontinuously proposed, but they overemphasize the improvements in accuracy and\nspeed while other capabilities such as versatility, robustness, resource and\nenergy efficiency are omitted. A reference benchmark for existing networks does\nnot exist, nor does a standard evaluation guideline for designing new networks,\nwhich results in ambiguous and inconsistent comparisons. We, thus, conduct a\ncomprehensive study on multiple real-time detectors (anchor-, keypoint-, and\ntransformer-based) on a wide range of datasets and report results on an\nextensive set of metrics. We also study the impact of variables such as image\nsize, anchor dimensions, confidence thresholds, and architecture layers on the\noverall performance. We analyze the robustness of detection networks against\ndistribution shifts, natural corruptions, and adversarial attacks. Also, we\nprovide a calibration analysis to gauge the reliability of the predictions.\nFinally, to highlight the real-world impact, we conduct two unique case\nstudies, on autonomous driving and healthcare applications. To further gauge\nthe capability of networks in critical real-time applications, we report the\nperformance after deploying the detection networks on edge devices. Our\nextensive empirical study can act as a guideline for the industrial community\nto make an informed choice on the existing networks.

Surprisingly, when executing such a ``home run'', the mice do\nnot follow the exact reverse path, in fact, the entry path and home path have\nvery little overlap. Recent work proposed a hierarchical active inference model\nfor navigation, where the low level model makes inferences about hidden states\nand poses that explain sensory inputs, whereas the high level model makes\ninferences about moving between locations, effectively building a map of the\nenvironment. However, using this ``map'' for planning, only allows the agent to\nfind trajectories that it previously explored, far from the observed mice's\nbehaviour.

We propose a solution in the form of an intervention,\nwherein the effect of changing the distribution of features of ACRM datasets is\nstudied on the target feature. Subsequently, a set of counterfactuals is also\nobtained that may be furnished to any customer who demands an explanation of\nthe decision taken by the bank/insurance company. Except for the credit card\nchurn prediction dataset, good quality counterfactuals were generated for the\nloan default, insurance fraud detection, and credit card fraud detection\ndatasets, where changes in no more than three features are observed.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized method enabling hospitals to\ncollaboratively learn a model without sharing private patient data for\ntraining. In FL, participant hospitals periodically exchange training results\nrather than training samples with a central server. However, having access to\nmodel parameters or gradients can expose private training data samples. To\naddress this challenge, we adopt secure multiparty computation (SMC) to\nestablish a privacy-preserving federated learning framework. In our proposed\nmethod, the hospitals are divided into clusters. After local training, each\nhospital splits its model weights among other hospitals in the same cluster\nsuch that no single hospital can retrieve other hospitals' weights on its own.\nThen, all hospitals sum up the received weights, sending the results to the\ncentral server. Finally, the central server aggregates the results, retrieving\nthe average of models' weights and updating the model without having access to\nindividual hospitals' weights. We conduct experiments on a publicly available\nrepository, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We compare the performance of the\nproposed framework with differential privacy and federated averaging as the\nbaseline. The results reveal that compared to differential privacy, our\nframework can achieve higher accuracy with no privacy leakage risk at a cost of\nhigher communication overhead.",

Therefore, in this survey, we first introduce the\nbackground and ongoing progress in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality\n(VR), mixed reality (MR) and spatial computing, followed by the technical\naspects of AI and 6G. Then, we survey the role of AI in the Metaverse by\nreviewing the state-of-the-art in deep learning, computer vision, and edge AI.\nNext, we investigate the promising services of B5G/6G towards Metaverse,\nfollowed by identifying the role of AI in 6G networks and 6G networks for AI in\nsupport of Metaverse applications. Finally, we enlist the existing and\npotential applications, usecases, and projects to highlight the importance of\nprogress in the Metaverse.

This is made possible with several newly devised components:\n1) A contrastive lip-sync discriminator for accurate lip synchronization, 2) A\nconditional sequential variational autoencoder that learns the latent motion\nspace disentangled from the lip movements, such that we can independently\nmanipulate the motions and lip movements while preserving the identity. 3) An\nauto-regressive prior augmented with normalizing flow to learn a complex\naudio-to-motion multi-modal latent space. Equipped with these components,\nStyleTalker can generate talking head videos not only in a motion-controllable\nway when another motion source video is given but also in a completely\naudio-driven manner by inferring realistic motions from the input audio.\nThrough extensive experiments and user studies, we show that our model is able\nto synthesize talking head videos with impressive perceptual quality which are\naccurately lip-synced with the input audios, largely outperforming\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

Vox-Surf is suitable for almost any\nscenario thanks to sparsity inherited from voxel representation and can be\neasily trained from multiple view images. We leverage the progressive training\nprocedure to extract important voxels gradually for further optimization so\nthat only valid voxels are preserved, which greatly reduces the number of\nsampling points and increases rendering speed.The fine voxels can also be\nconsidered as the bounding volume for collision detection.The experiments show\nthat Vox-Surf representation can learn delicate surface details and accurate\ncolor with less memory and faster rendering speed than other methods.We also\nshow that Vox-Surf can be more practical in scene editing and AR applications.",

    "abstract": "Conventional Few-shot classification (FSC) aims to recognize samples from\nnovel classes given limited labeled data. Recently, domain generalization FSC\n(DG-FSC) has been proposed with the goal to recognize novel class samples from\nunseen domains. DG-FSC poses considerable challenges to many models due to the\ndomain shift between base classes (used in training) and novel classes\n(encountered in evaluation). In this work, we make two novel contributions to\ntackle DG-FSC. Our first contribution is to propose Born-Again Network (BAN)\nepisodic training and comprehensively investigate its effectiveness for DG-FSC.\nAs a specific form of knowledge distillation, BAN has been shown to achieve\nimproved generalization in conventional supervised classification with a\nclosed-set setup. This improved generalization motivates us to study BAN for\nDG-FSC, and we show that BAN is promising to address the domain shift\nencountered in DG-FSC. Building on the encouraging finding, our second (major)\ncontribution is to propose few-shot BAN, FS-BAN, a novel BAN approach for\nDG-FSC. Our proposed FS-BAN includes novel multi-task learning objectives:\nMutual Regularization, Mismatched Teacher and Meta-Control Temperature, each of\nthese is specifically designed to overcome central and unique challenges in\nDG-FSC, namely overfitting and domain discrepancy. We analyze different design\nchoices of these techniques. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and\nqualitative analysis and evaluation using six datasets and three baseline\nmodels. The results suggest that our proposed FS-BAN consistently improves the\ngeneralization performance of baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art\naccuracy for DG-FSC.",

Each of these elements can effectively reflect a\nphase-shifted version of the incident electromagnetic wave. By adjusting the\nwave phases in real time, the propagation environment of the reflected signals\ncan be dynamically reconfigured to enhance communication reliability, boost\ntransmission rate, expand cellular coverage, and strengthen communication\nsecurity. In this paper, we provide an overview on RIS-assisted wireless\ncommunications. Specifically, we elaborate on the state-of-the-art enabling\ntechniques of RISs as well as their corresponding substantial benefits from the\nperspectives of RIS reflection and RIS modulation. With these benefits, we\nenvision the integration of RIS into emerging applications for 6G. In addition,\ncommunication security is of unprecedented importance in the 6G network with\nubiquitous wireless services in multifarious verticals and areas. We highlight\npotential contributions of RIS to physical-layer security in terms of secrecy\nrate and secrecy outage probability, exemplified by a typical case study from\nboth theoretical and numerical aspects.

The advent of machine learning, artificial\nintelligence and big data has opened up new tools in the fight against frauds.\nGiven past transactions, a machine learning algorithm has the ability to\n'learn' infinitely complex characteristics in order to identify frauds in\nreal-time, surpassing the best human investigators. However, the developments\nin fraud detection algorithms has been challenging and slow due the massively\nunbalanced nature of fraud data, absence of benchmarks and standard evaluation\nmetrics to identify better performing classifiers, lack of sharing and\ndisclosure of research findings and the difficulties in getting access to\nconfidential transaction data for research. This work investigates the\nproperties of typical massively imbalanced fraud data sets, their availability,\nsuitability for research use while exploring the widely varying nature of fraud\ndistributions. Furthermore, we show how human annotation errors compound with\nmachine classification errors.

Natural Language Interface\n(NLI) presents promising benefits due to its learnability and usability.\nHowever, supporting NLIs for authoring tools requires expertise in natural\nlanguage processing, while existing NLIs are mostly designed for visual\nanalytic workflow. In this paper, we propose an authoring-oriented NLI pipeline\nby introducing a structured representation of users' visualization editing\nintents, called editing actions, based on a formative study and an extensive\nsurvey on visualization construction tools. The editing actions are executable,\nand thus decouple natural language interpretation and visualization\napplications as an intermediate layer. We implement a deep learning-based NL\ninterpreter to translate NL utterances into editing actions. The interpreter is\nreusable and extensible across authoring tools. The authoring tools only need\nto map the editing actions into tool-specific operations. To illustrate the\nusages of the NL interpreter, we implement an Excel chart editor and a\nproof-of-concept authoring tool, VisTalk. We conduct a user study with VisTalk\nto understand the usage patterns of NL-based authoring systems.

Thus, although these traditional methods\nare accurate in practice, there has been no theoretical guarantee that they\nwill produce small trees. In this paper, we justify the use of a general family\nof impurity functions, including the popular functions of entropy and\nGini-index, in scenarios where small trees are desirable, by showing that a\nsimple enhancement can equip them with complexity guarantees. We consider a\ngeneral setting, where objects to be classified are drawn from an arbitrary\nprobability distribution, classification can be binary or multi-class, and\nsplitting tests are associated with non-uniform costs. As a measure of tree\ncomplexity, we adopt the expected cost to classify an object drawn from the\ninput distribution, which, in the uniform-cost case, is the expected number of\ntests. We propose a tree-induction algorithm that gives a logarithmic\napproximation guarantee on the tree complexity. This approximation factor is\ntight up to a constant factor under mild assumptions. The algorithm recursively\nselects a test that maximizes a greedy criterion defined as a weighted sum of\nthree components. The first two components encourage the selection of tests\nthat improve the balance and the cost-efficiency of the tree, respectively,\nwhile the third impurity-reduction component encourages the selection of more\ndiscriminative tests. As shown in our empirical evaluation, compared to the\noriginal heuristics, the enhanced algorithms strike an excellent balance\nbetween predictive accuracy and tree complexity.",

In medical\nimaging, for example, we may want to study the causal effect of genetic,\nenvironmental, or lifestyle factors on the normal and pathological variation of\nanatomical phenotypes. However, while anatomical shape models of 3D surface\nmeshes, extracted from automated image segmentation, can be reliably\nconstructed, there is a lack of computational tooling to enable causal\nreasoning about morphological variations. To tackle this problem, we propose\ndeep structural causal shape models (CSMs), which utilise high-quality mesh\ngeneration techniques, from geometric deep learning, within the expressive\nframework of deep structural causal models. CSMs enable subject-specific\nprognoses through counterfactual mesh generation (\"How would this patient's\nbrain structure change if they were ten years older?\"), which is in contrast to\nmost current works on purely population-level statistical shape modelling.

Reasonable worst-case bounds for this\nquantity exist only for particular subsets of L2, like linear spaces or sets of\nsparse vectors.

    "abstract": "In this article, we present the first deterministic directed Laplacian L\nsystems solver that runs in time almost-linear in the number of non-zero\nentries of L. Previous reductions imply the first deterministic almost-linear\ntime algorithms for computing various fundamental quantities on directed graphs\nincluding stationary distributions, personalized PageRank, hitting times and\nescape probabilities.\nWe obtain these results by introducing partial symmetrization, a new\ntechnique that makes the Laplacian of an Eulerian directed graph ``less\ndirected'' in a useful sense, which may be of independent interest. The\nusefulness of this technique comes from two key observations: Firstly, the\npartially symmetrized Laplacian preconditions the original Eulerian Laplacian\nwell in Richardson iteration, enabling us to construct a solver for the\noriginal matrix from a solver for the partially symmetrized one. Secondly, the\nundirected structure in the partially symmetrized Laplacian makes it possible\nto sparsify the matrix very crudely, i.e. with large spectral error, and still\nshow that Richardson iterations convergence when using the sparsified matrix as\na preconditioner. This allows us to develop deterministic sparsification tools\nfor the partially symmetrized Laplacian.\nTogether with previous reductions from directed Laplacians to Eulerian\nLaplacians, our technique results in the first deterministic almost-linear time\nalgorithm for solving linear equations in directed Laplacians. To emphasize the\ngenerality of our new technique, we show that two prominent existing\n(randomized) frameworks for solving linear equations in Eulerian Laplacians can\nbe derandomized in this way: the squaring-based framework of Cohen, Kelner,\nPeebles, Peng, Rao, Sidford and Vladu (STOC 2017) and the sparsified\nCholesky-based framework of Peng and Song (STOC 2022).",

According to this trend, the demand for\nhigh-quality point clouds is increasing, but there is still a problem with the\nhigh cost of obtaining high-quality point clouds. Therefore, with the recent\nremarkable development of deep learning, point cloud up-sampling research,\nwhich uses deep learning to generate high-quality point clouds from low-quality\npoint clouds, is one of the fields attracting considerable attention. This\npaper proposes a new point cloud up-sampling method called Point cloud\nUp-sampling via Multi-scale Features Attention (PU-MFA). Inspired by previous\nstudies that reported good performance using the multi-scale features or\nattention mechanisms, PU-MFA merges the two through a U-Net structure. In\naddition, PU-MFA adaptively uses multi-scale features to refine the global\nfeatures effectively. The performance of PU-MFA was compared with other\nstate-of-the-art methods through various experiments using the PU-GAN dataset,\nwhich is a synthetic point cloud dataset, and the KITTI dataset, which is the\nreal-scanned point cloud dataset. In various experimental results, PU-MFA\nshowed superior performance in quantitative and qualitative evaluation compared\nto other state-of-the-art methods, proving the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod.

Several\nmethods have been proposed that embed the watermark into the trainable\nparameters of the network (white box watermarking) or into the input-output\nmappping implemented by the network in correspondence to specific inputs (black\nbox watermarking). In both cases, achieving robustness against fine tuning,\nmodel compression and, even more, transfer learning, is one of the most\ndifficult challenges researchers are trying to face with. In this paper, we\npropose a new white-box, multi-bit watermarking algorithm with strong\nrobustness properties, including retraining for transfer learning. Robustness\nis achieved thanks to a new information coding strategy according to which the\nwatermark message is spread across a number of fixed weights, whose position\ndepends on a secret key. The weights hosting the watermark are set prior to\ntraining, and are left unchanged throughout the entire training procedure. The\ndistribution of the weights carrying out the message is theoretically optimised\nto make sure that the watermarked weights are indistinguishable from the other\nweights, while at the same time keeping their amplitude as large as possible to\nimprove robustness against retraining.

Recent advanced works\ngenerally employ a series of object attributes, e.g., position, size, velocity,\nand appearance, to provide the clues for the association in 3D MOT. However,\nthese cues may not be reliable due to some visual noise, such as occlusion and\nblur, leading to tracking performance bottleneck. To reveal the dilemma, we\nconduct extensive empirical analysis to expose the key bottleneck of each clue\nand how they correlate with each other. The analysis results motivate us to\nefficiently absorb the merits among all cues, and adaptively produce an optimal\ntacking manner. Specifically, we present Location and Velocity Quality\nLearning, which efficiently guides the network to estimate the quality of\npredicted object attributes. Based on these quality estimations, we propose a\nquality-aware object association (QOA) strategy to leverage the quality score\nas an important reference factor for achieving robust association. Despite its\nsimplicity, extensive experiments indicate that the proposed strategy\nsignificantly boosts tracking performance by 2.2% AMOTA and our method\noutperforms all existing state-of-the-art works on nuScenes by a large margin.\nMoreover, QTrack achieves 48.0% and 51.1% AMOTA tracking performance on the\nnuScenes validation and test sets, which significantly reduces the performance\ngap between pure camera and LiDAR based trackers.",

    "abstract": "Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is an important yet challenging task with\nmany applications such as photographing and autonomous driving. Unlike single\nimage low-light enhancement, most LLVE methods utilize temporal information\nfrom adjacent frames to restore the color and remove the noise of the target\nframe. However, these algorithms, based on the framework of multi-frame\nalignment and enhancement, may produce multi-frame fusion artifacts when\nencountering extreme low light or fast motion. In this paper, inspired by the\nlow latency and high dynamic range of events, we use synthetic events from\nmultiple frames to guide the enhancement and restoration of low-light videos.\nOur method contains three stages: 1) event synthesis and enhancement, 2) event\nand image fusion, and 3) low-light enhancement. In this framework, we design\ntwo novel modules (event-image fusion transform and event-guided dual branch)\nfor the second and third stages, respectively. Extensive experiments show that\nour method outperforms existing low-light video or single image enhancement\napproaches on both synthetic and real LLVE datasets.",

These systems contain hundreds to tens of thousands of accelerators,\nenabling peta- and exa-scale levels of compute for scientific workloads. Recent\nwork demonstrated that power management (PM) can impact application performance\nin CPU-based HPC systems, even when machines have the same architecture and SKU\n(stock keeping unit).

However, while modern HPC systems widely employ accelerators\nsuch as GPUs, it is unclear how much this variability affects applications.\nAccordingly, we seek to characterize the extent of variation due to GPU PM in\nmodern HPC and supercomputing systems. We study a variety of applications that\nstress different GPU components on five large-scale computing centers with\nmodern GPUs: Oak Ridge's Summit, Sandia's Vortex, TACC's Frontera and Longhorn,\nand Livermore's Corona.

Regardless of the application, cluster, GPU vendor,\nand cooling method, our results show significant variation: 8% (max 22%)\naverage performance variation even though the GPU architecture and vendor SKU\nare identical within each cluster, with outliers up to 1.5X slower than the\nmedian GPU.

If it happens, the\nminority data will be overwhelmed by the majority, which presents quite a\nchallenge for data science. To address the class imbalance problem, researchers\nhave proposed lots of methods: some people make the data set balanced (SMOTE),\nsome others refine the loss function (Focal Loss), and even someone has noticed\nthe value of labels influences class-imbalanced learning (Yang and Xu.\nRethinking the value of labels for improving class-imbalanced learning. In\nNeurIPS 2020), but no one changes the way to encode the labels of data yet.\nNowadays, the most prevailing technique to encode labels is the one-hot\nencoding due to its nice performance in the general situation. However, it is\nnot a good choice for imbalanced data, because the classifier will treat\nmajority and minority samples equally. In this paper, we innovatively propose\nthe enhancement encoding technique, which is specially designed for the\nimbalanced classification. The enhancement encoding combines re-weighting and\ncost-sensitiveness, which can reflect the difference between hard and easy (or\nminority and majority) classes. In order to reduce the number of validation\nsamples and the computation cost, we also replace the confusion matrix with the\nnovel soft-confusion matrix which works better with a small validation set. In\nthe experiments, we evaluate the enhancement encoding with three different\ntypes of loss. And the results show that enhancement encoding is very effective\nto improve the performance of the network trained with imbalanced data.\nParticularly, the performance on minority classes is much better.",

LMs are becoming increasingly important tools in Artificial\nIntelligence, because of the vast quantity of information they can store. In\nthis work, we present ProP (Prompting as Probing), which utilizes GPT-3, a\nlarge Language Model originally proposed by OpenAI in 2020, to perform the task\nof Knowledge Base Construction (KBC). ProP implements a multi-step approach\nthat combines a variety of prompting techniques to achieve this. Our results\nshow that manual prompt curation is essential, that the LM must be encouraged\nto give answer sets of variable lengths, in particular including empty answer\nsets, that true/false questions are a useful device to increase precision on\nsuggestions generated by the LM, that the size of the LM is a crucial factor,\nand that a dictionary of entity aliases improves the LM score. Our evaluation\nstudy indicates that these proposed techniques can substantially enhance the\nquality of the final predictions: ProP won track 2 of the LM-KBC competition,\noutperforming the baseline by 36.4 percentage points. Our implementation is\navailable on https://github.com/HEmile/iswc-challenge.",

    "abstract": "Tropical forests represent the home of many species on the planet for flora\nand fauna, retaining billions of tons of carbon footprint, promoting clouds and\nrain formation, implying a crucial role in the global ecosystem, besides\nrepresenting the home to countless indigenous peoples. Unfortunately, millions\nof hectares of tropical forests are lost every year due to deforestation or\ndegradation. To mitigate that fact, monitoring and deforestation detection\nprograms are in use, in addition to public policies for the prevention and\npunishment of criminals. These monitoring/detection programs generally use\nremote sensing images, image processing techniques, machine learning methods,\nand expert photointerpretation to analyze, identify and quantify possible\nchanges in forest cover. Several projects have proposed different computational\napproaches, tools, and models to efficiently identify recent deforestation\nareas, improving deforestation monitoring programs in tropical forests. In this\nsense, this paper proposes the use of pattern classifiers based on\nneuroevolution technique (NEAT) in tropical forest deforestation detection\ntasks. Furthermore, a novel framework called e-NEAT has been created and\nachieved classification results above $90\\%$ for balanced accuracy measure in\nthe target application using an extremely reduced and limited training set for\nlearning the classification models. These results represent a relative gain of\n$6.2\\%$ over the best baseline ensemble method compared in this paper",

Among them, it is one of the most important tasks to\njudge traffic congestion by analysing the congestion factors. Recently, various\ntraditional and machine-learning-based models have been introduced for\npredicting traffic congestion. However, these models are either poorly\naggregated for massive congestion factors or fail to make accurate predictions\nfor every precise location in large-scale space. To alleviate these problems, a\nnovel end-to-end framework based on convolutional neural networks is proposed\nin this paper.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method to identify identical commodities. In\ne-commerce scenarios, commodities are usually described by both images and\ntext. By definition, identical commodities are those that have identical key\nattributes and are cognitively identical to consumers. There are two main\nchallenges: 1) The extraction and fusion of multi-modal representation. 2) The\nability to verify whether two commodities are identical by comparing the\ndistance between representations with a threshold. To address the above\nproblems, we propose an end-to-end identical commodity verification method\nbased on self-adaptive thresholds. We use a dual-stream network to extract\ncommodity embeddings and threshold embeddings separately and then concatenate\nthem to obtain commodity representation. Our method is able to obtain different\nthresholds according to different commodities while maintaining the\nindexability of the entire commodity representation. We experimentally validate\nthe effectiveness of our multimodal feature fusion and the advantages of\nself-adaptive thresholds. Besides, our method achieves an F1 score of 0.8936\nand takes the 3rd place on the leaderboard for the second task of the CCKS-2022\nKnowledge Graph Evaluation for Digital Commerce Competition.

The new approach matches\nnearly 500,000 matched scholars with their Twitter accounts with a level of\nhigh precision and moderate recall.

    "abstract": "Most of the real-world problems are multimodal in nature that consists of\nmultiple optimum values. Multimodal optimization is defined as the process of\nfinding multiple global and local optima (as opposed to a single solution) of a\nfunction. It enables a user to switch between different solutions as per the\nneed while still maintaining the optimal system performance. Classical\ngradient-based methods fail for optimization problems in which the objective\nfunctions are either discontinuous or non-differentiable. Evolutionary\nAlgorithms (EAs) are able to find multiple solutions within a population in a\nsingle algorithmic run as compared to classical optimization techniques that\nneed multiple restarts and multiple runs to find different solutions. Hence,\nseveral EAs have been proposed to solve such kinds of problems. However,\nDifferential Evolution (DE) algorithm is a population-based heuristic method\nthat can solve such optimization problems, and it is simple to implement. The\npotential challenge in Multi-Modal Optimization Problems (MMOPs) is to search\nthe function space efficiently to locate most of the peaks accurately. The\noptimization problem could be to minimize or maximize a given objective\nfunction and we aim to solve the maximization problems on multimodal functions\nin this study. Hence, we have proposed an algorithm known as Enhanced\nOpposition Differential Evolution (EODE) algorithm to solve the MMOPs. The\nproposed algorithm has been tested on IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation\n(CEC) 2013 benchmark functions, and it achieves competitive results compared to\nthe existing state-of-the-art approaches.",

We provide three audio alternatives: earcons,\nverbal notifications, and real-world sound effects. PVI can select and combine\ntheir preferred feedback alternatives for different avatars, bubbles, and\nsocial contexts. We evaluated VRBubble and an audio beacon baseline with 12 PVI\nin a navigation and a conversation context.

    "abstract": "Human intelligence is able to first learn some basic skills for solving basic\nproblems and then assemble such basic skills into complex skills for solving\ncomplex or new problems. For example, the basic skills ``dig hole,'' ``put\ntree,'' ``backfill'' and ``watering'' compose a complex skill ``plant a tree''.\nBesides, some basic skills can be reused for solving other problems. For\nexample, the basic skill ``dig hole'' not only can be used for planting a tree,\nbut also can be used for mining treasures, building a drain, or landfilling.\nThe ability to learn basic skills and reuse them for various tasks is very\nimportant for humans because it helps to avoid learning too many skills for\nsolving each individual task, and makes it possible to solve a compositional\nnumber of tasks by learning just a few number of basic skills, which saves a\nconsiderable amount of memory and computation in the human brain. We believe\nthat machine intelligence should also capture the ability of learning basic\nskills and reusing them by composing into complex skills. In computer science\nlanguage, each basic skill is a ``module'', which is a reusable network of a\nconcrete meaning and performs a specific basic operation. The modules are\nassembled into a bigger ``model'' for doing a more complex task. The assembling\nprocedure is adaptive to the input or task, i.e., for a given task, the modules\nshould be assembled into the most suitable model for solving the task. As a\nresult, different inputs or tasks could have different assembled models, which\nenables self-assembling AI. In this work, we propose Modularized Adaptive\nNeural Architecture Search (MANAS) to demonstrate the above idea.

    "abstract": "Fuzz testing has been used to find bugs in programs since the 1990s, but\ndespite decades of dedicated research, there is still no consensus on which\nfuzzing techniques work best. One reason for this is the paucity of ground\ntruth: bugs in real programs with known root causes and triggering inputs are\ndifficult to collect at a meaningful scale. Bug injection technologies that add\nsynthetic bugs into real programs seem to offer a solution, but the differences\nin finding these synthetic bugs versus organic bugs have not previously been\nexplored at a large scale. Using over 80 years of CPU time, we ran eight\nfuzzers across 20 targets from the Rode0day bug-finding competition and the\nLAVA-M corpus. Experiments were standardized with respect to compute resources\nand metrics gathered. These experiments show differences in fuzzer performance\nas well as the impact of various configuration options. For instance, it is\nclear that integrating symbolic execution with mutational fuzzing is very\neffective and that using dictionaries improves performance. Other conclusions\nare less clear-cut; for example, no one fuzzer beat all others on all tests. It\nis noteworthy that no fuzzer found any organic bugs (i.e., one reported in a\nCVE), despite 50 such bugs being available for discovery in the fuzzing corpus.\nA close analysis of results revealed a possible explanation: a dramatic\ndifference between where synthetic and organic bugs live with respect to the\n''main path'' discovered by fuzzers. We find that recent updates to bug\ninjection systems have made synthetic bugs more difficult to discover, but they\nare still significantly easier to find than organic bugs in our target\nprograms. Finally, this study identifies flaws in bug injection techniques and\nsuggests a number of axes along which synthetic bugs should be improved.",

Although the previous editions valued\nthe participation of leading researchers in the field and several exceptional\ninvited speakers who tackled down some fundamental points in this research\ndomains, we wish to continue to further explore the role of trust in robotics\nto present groundbreaking research to effectively design and develop socially\nacceptable and trustable robots to be deployed \"in the wild\".\nWebsite: https://scrita.herts.ac.uk",

    "title": "Dynamic Causal Collaborative Filtering",
    "abstract": "Causal graph, as an effective and powerful tool for causal modeling, is\nusually assumed as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). However, recommender systems\nusually involve feedback loops, defined as the cyclic process of recommending\nitems, incorporating user feedback in model updates, and repeating the\nprocedure. As a result, it is important to incorporate loops into the causal\ngraphs to accurately model the dynamic and iterative data generation process\nfor recommender systems. However, feedback loops are not always beneficial\nsince over time they may encourage more and more narrowed content exposure,\nwhich if left unattended, may results in echo chambers. As a result, it is\nimportant to understand when the recommendations will lead to echo chambers and\nhow to mitigate echo chambers without hurting the recommendation performance.\nIn this paper, we design a causal graph with loops to describe the dynamic\nprocess of recommendation. We then take Markov process to analyze the\nmathematical properties of echo chamber such as the conditions that lead to\necho chambers. Inspired by the theoretical analysis, we propose a Dynamic\nCausal Collaborative Filtering ($\\partial$CCF) model, which estimates users'\npost-intervention preference on items based on back-door adjustment and\nmitigates echo chamber with counterfactual reasoning. Multiple experiments are\nconducted on real-world datasets and results show that our framework can\nmitigate echo chambers better than other state-of-the-art frameworks while\nachieving comparable recommendation performance with the base recommendation\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "This paper tackles the problem of efficient video recognition. In this area,\nvideo transformers have recently dominated the efficiency (top-1 accuracy vs\nFLOPs) spectrum. At the same time, there have been some attempts in the image\ndomain which challenge the necessity of the self-attention operation within the\ntransformer architecture, advocating the use of simpler approaches for token\nmixing. However, there are no results yet for the case of video recognition,\nwhere the self-attention operator has a significantly higher impact (compared\nto the case of images) on efficiency. To address this gap, in this paper, we\nmake the following contributions: (a) we construct a highly efficient \\&\naccurate attention-free block based on the shift operator, coined Affine-Shift\nblock, specifically designed to approximate as closely as possible the\noperations in the MHSA block of a Transformer layer. Based on our Affine-Shift\nblock, we construct our Affine-Shift Transformer and show that it already\noutperforms all existing shift/MLP--based architectures for ImageNet\nclassification. (b) We extend our formulation in the video domain to construct\nVideo Affine-Shift Transformer (VAST), the very first purely attention-free\nshift-based video transformer. (c) We show that VAST significantly outperforms\nrecent state-of-the-art transformers on the most popular action recognition\nbenchmarks for the case of models with low computational and memory footprint.\nCode will be made available.",

Moreover, we\ndevelop an uncertainty-aware selection strategy to obtain clean anomaly\ninstances and a NFs module to generate the pseudo anomalies.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed for predicting\nclinically relevant biomarkers, including microsatellite instability (MSI), for\ncolorectal cancers (CRC). However, the current deep-learning networks are\ndata-hungry and require large training datasets, which are often lacking in the\nmedical domain. In this study, based on the latest Hierarchical Vision\nTransformer using Shifted Windows (Swin-T), we developed an efficient workflow\nfor biomarkers in CRC (MSI, hypermutation, chromosomal instability, CpG island\nmethylator phenotype, BRAF, and TP53 mutation) that only required relatively\nsmall datasets, but achieved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) predictive\nperformance. Our Swin-T workflow not only substantially outperformed published\nmodels in an intra-study cross-validation experiment using TCGA-CRC-DX dataset\n(N = 462), but also showed excellent generalizability in cross-study external\nvalidation and delivered a SOTA AUROC of 0.90 for MSI using the MCO dataset for\ntraining (N = 1065) and the same TCGA-CRC-DX for testing. Similar performance\n(AUROC=0.91) was achieved by Echle and colleagues using 8000 training samples\n(ResNet18) on the same testing dataset. Swin-T was extremely efficient using\nsmall training datasets and exhibits robust predictive performance with only\n200-500 training samples. These data indicate that Swin-T may be 5-10 times\nmore efficient than the current state-of-the-art algorithms for MSI based on\nResNet18 and ShuffleNet. Furthermore, the Swin-T models showed promise as\npre-screening tests for MSI status and BRAF mutation status, which could\nexclude and reduce the samples before the subsequent standard testing in a\ncascading diagnostic workflow to allow turnaround time reduction and cost\nsaving.",

    "title": "Estimation Contracts for Outlier-Robust Geometric Perception",
    "abstract": "Outlier-robust estimation is a fundamental problem and has been extensively\ninvestigated by statisticians and practitioners. The last few years have seen a\nconvergence across research fields towards \"algorithmic robust statistics\",\nwhich focuses on developing tractable outlier-robust techniques for\nhigh-dimensional estimation problems. Despite this convergence, research\nefforts across fields have been mostly disconnected from one another. This\npaper bridges recent work on certifiable outlier-robust estimation for\ngeometric perception in robotics and computer vision with parallel work in\nrobust statistics. In particular, we adapt and extend recent results on robust\nlinear regressions (applicable to the low-outlier case with << 50% outliers)\nand list-decodable regression (applicable to the high-outlier case with >> 50%\noutliers) to the setup commonly found in robotics and vision, where (i)\nvariables (e.g., rotations, poses) belong to a non-convex domain, (ii)\nmeasurements are vector-valued, and (iii) the number of outliers is not known a\npriori. The emphasis here is on performance guarantees: rather than proposing\nnew algorithms, we provide conditions on the input measurements under which\nmodern estimation algorithms are guaranteed to recover an estimate close to the\nground truth in the presence of outliers. These conditions are what we call an\n\"estimation contract\". Besides the proposed extensions of existing results, we\nbelieve the main contributions of this paper are (i) to unify parallel research\nlines by pointing out commonalities and differences, (ii) to introduce advanced\nmaterial (e.g., sum-of-squares proofs) in an accessible and self-contained\npresentation for the practitioner, and (iii) to point out a few immediate\nopportunities and open questions in outlier-robust geometric perception.",

We show there is a 1-1 relation between regular connected digraphs of\ndegree d and the Cayley graphs of groupoids (not necessarily associative but\nwith left identity and right cancellation) with d generators.

For general Bayesian estimation of complex-valued vectors,\nit is known that the widely-linear minimum mean-squared-error (WLMMSE)\nestimator can achieve a lower mean-squared-error (MSE) than that of the linear\nminimum MSE (LMMSE) estimator. Inspired by the WLMMSE estimator, in this paper\nwe develop the graph signal processing (GSP)-WLMMSE estimator, which minimizes\nthe MSE among estimators that are represented as a two-channel output of a\ngraph filter, i.e. widely-linear GSP estimators. We discuss the properties of\nthe proposed GSP-WLMMSE estimator. In particular, we show that the MSE of the\nGSP-WLMMSE estimator is always equal to or lower than the MSE of the GSP-LMMSE\nestimator. The GSP-WLMMSE estimator is based on diagonal covariance matrices in\nthe graph frequency domain, and thus has reduced complexity compared with the\nWLMMSE estimator. This property is especially important when using the\nsample-mean versions of these estimators that are based on a training dataset.\nWe then state conditions under which the low-complexity GSP-WLMMSE estimator\ncoincides with the WLMMSE estimator. In the simulations, we investigate two\nsynthetic estimation problems (with linear and nonlinear models) and the\nproblem of state estimation in power systems. For these problems, it is shown\nthat the GSP-WLMMSE estimator outperforms the GSP-LMMSE estimator and achieves\nsimilar performance to that of the WLMMSE estimator.",

We extend\nprevious studies accounting for the cardiomyocyte shape variability, water\nexchange between the cardiomyocytes (intercalated discs), myocardial\nmicrostructure disarray, and four sheetlet orientations. In the first stage of\nthe method, cardiomyocytes and sheetlets are generated by considering the shape\nvariability and intercalated discs in cardiomyocyte-to-cardiomyocyte\nconnections. Sheetlets are then aggregated and oriented in the directions of\ninterest. Our morphometric study demonstrates no significant difference\n($p>0.01$) between the distribution of volume, length, and primary and\nsecondary axes of the numerical and real (literature) cardiomyocyte data.\nStructural correlation analysis validates that the in-silico tissue is in the\nsame class of disorderliness as the real tissue. Additionally, the absolute\nangle differences between the simulated helical angle (HA) and input HA\n(reference value) of the cardiomyocytes ($4.3^\\circ\\pm 3.1^\\circ$) demonstrate\na good agreement with the absolute angle difference between the measured HA\nusing experimental cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) and histology\n(reference value) reported by (Holmes et al., 2000) ($3.7^\\circ\\pm6.4^\\circ$)\nand (Scollan et al., 1998) ($4.9^\\circ\\pm 14.6^\\circ$).

    "title": "CM-MLP: Cascade Multi-scale MLP with Axial Context Relation Encoder for  Edge Segmentation of Medical Image",
    "abstract": "The convolutional-based methods provide good segmentation performance in the\nmedical image segmentation task. However, those methods have the following\nchallenges when dealing with the edges of the medical images: (1) Previous\nconvolutional-based methods do not focus on the boundary relationship between\nforeground and background around the segmentation edge, which leads to the\ndegradation of segmentation performance when the edge changes complexly. (2)\nThe inductive bias of the convolutional layer cannot be adapted to complex edge\nchanges and the aggregation of multiple-segmented areas, resulting in its\nperformance improvement mostly limited to segmenting the body of segmented\nareas instead of the edge. To address these challenges, we propose the CM-MLP\nframework on MFI (Multi-scale Feature Interaction) block and ACRE (Axial\nContext Relation Encoder) block for accurate segmentation of the edge of\nmedical image. In the MFI block, we propose the cascade multi-scale MLP\n(Cascade MLP) to process all local information from the deeper layers of the\nnetwork simultaneously and utilize a cascade multi-scale mechanism to fuse\ndiscrete local information gradually.

    "title": "Convolutional Neural Networks with A Topographic Representation Module  for EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces",
    "abstract": "Objective: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown great potential in\nthe field of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) due to their ability to directly\nprocess the raw Electroencephalogram (EEG) without artificial feature\nextraction. The raw EEG signal is usually represented as 2-Dimensional (2-D)\nmatrix composed of channels and time points, which ignores the spatial\ntopological information of EEG. Our goal is to make the CNN with the raw EEG\nsignal as input have the ability to learn the EEG spatial topological features,\nand improve its classification performance while essentially maintaining its\noriginal structure. Methods: We propose an EEG Topographic Representation\nModule (TRM). This module consists of (1) a mapping block from the raw EEG\nsignal to a 3-D topographic map and (2) a convolution block from the\ntopographic map to an output of the same size as the input. We embed the TRM to\n3 widely used CNNs, and tested them on 2 different types of publicly available\ndatasets. Results: The results show that the classification accuracies of the 3\nCNNs are improved on both datasets after using TRM. The average classification\naccuracies of DeepConvNet, EEGNet and ShallowConvNet with TRM are improved by\n4.70\\%, 1.29\\% and 0.91\\% on Emergency Braking During Simulated Driving Dataset\n(EBDSDD), and 2.83\\%, 2.17\\% and 2.00\\% on High Gamma Dataset (HGD),\nrespectively. Significance: By using TRM to mine the spatial topological\nfeatures of EEG, we improve the classification performance of 3 CNNs on 2\ndatasets. In addition,since the output of TRM has the same size as the input,\nany CNN with the raw EEG signal as input can use this module without changing\nthe original structure.",

    "abstract": "While hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) is a standard staining procedure,\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) staining further serves as a diagnostic and\nprognostic method. However, acquiring special staining results requires\nsubstantial costs.\nHence, we proposed a strategy for ultra-high-resolution unpaired\nimage-to-image translation: Kernelized Instance Normalization (KIN), which\npreserves local information and successfully achieves seamless stain\ntransformation with constant GPU memory usage. Given a patch, corresponding\nposition, and a kernel, KIN computes local statistics using convolution\noperation. In addition, KIN can be easily plugged into most currently developed\nframeworks without re-training.\nWe demonstrate that KIN achieves state-of-the-art stain transformation by\nreplacing instance normalization (IN) layers with KIN layers in three popular\nframeworks and testing on two histopathological datasets. Furthermore, we\nmanifest the generalizability of KIN with high-resolution natural images.\nFinally, human evaluation and several objective metrics are used to compare the\nperformance of different approaches.\nOverall, this is the first successful study for the ultra-high-resolution\nunpaired image-to-image translation with constant space complexity.

However, the sensitivity of these\nmetrics to variations in the statistical parameters that define an audio\ntexture is not well studied. In this work, we provide a systematic study of the\nsensitivity of some of the existing audio quality evaluation metrics to\nparameter variations in audio textures. Furthermore, we also study three more\npotentially parameter-sensitive metrics for audio texture synthesis, (a) a Gram\nmatrix based distance, (b) an Accumulated Gram metric using a summarized\nversion of the Gram matrices, and (c) a cochlear-model based statistical\nfeatures metric. These metrics use deep features that summarize the statistics\nof any given audio texture, thus being inherently sensitive to variations in\nthe statistical parameters that define an audio texture. We study and evaluate\nthe sensitivity of existing standard metrics as well as Gram matrix and\ncochlear-model based metrics to control-parameter variations in audio textures\nacross a wide range of texture and parameter types, and validate with\nsubjective evaluation.

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel semi-definite programming approach that\nsolves reach-avoid problems over open (i.e., not bounded a priori) time\nhorizons for dynamical systems modeled by polynomial stochastic differential\nequations. The reach-avoid problem in this paper is a probabilistic guarantee:\nwe approximate from the inner a p-reach-avoid set, i.e., the set of initial\nstates guaranteeing with probability larger than p that the system eventually\nenters a given target set while remaining inside a specified safe set till the\ntarget hit. Our approach begins with the construction of a bounded value\nfunction, whose strict p super-level set is equal to the p-reach-avoid set.\nThis value function is then reduced to a twice continuously differentiable\nsolution to a system of equations. The system of equations facilitates the\nconstruction of a semi-definite program using sum-of-squares decomposition for\nmultivariate polynomials and thus the transformation of nonconvex reach-avoid\nproblems into a convex optimization problem. The semi-definite program can be\nsolved efficiently in polynomial time via interior point methods. There are\nmany existing powerful algorithms and off-the-shelf software packages to solve\nit. It is worth noting here that our approach can straightforwardly be\nspecialized to address classical safety verification by, a.o., stochastic\nbarrier certificate methods and reach-avoid analysis for ordinary differential\nequations.

    "abstract": "Shear viscosity, though being a fundamental property of all liquids, is\ncomputationally expensive to estimate from equilibrium molecular dynamics\nsimulations. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) methods have been used to augment\nmolecular simulations in many contexts, thus showing promise to estimate\nviscosity too in a relatively inexpensive manner. However, ML methods face\nsignificant challenges like overfitting when the size of the data set is small,\nas is the case with viscosity. In this work, we train several ML models to\npredict the shear viscosity of a Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid, with particular\nemphasis on addressing issues arising from a small data set. Specifically, the\nissues related to model selection, performance estimation and uncertainty\nquantification were investigated. First, we show that the widely used\nperformance estimation procedure of using a single unseen data set shows a wide\nvariability on small data sets. In this context, the common practice of using\nCross validation (CV) to select the hyperparameters (model selection) can be\nadapted to estimate the generalization error (performance estimation) as well.\nWe compare two simple CV procedures for their ability to do both model\nselection and performance estimation, and find that k-fold CV based procedure\nshows a lower variance of error estimates. We discuss the role of performance\nmetrics in training and evaluation. Finally, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)\nand ensemble methods were used to estimate the uncertainty on individual\npredictions. The uncertainty estimates from GPR were also used to construct an\napplicability domain using which the ML models provided more reliable\npredictions on another small data set generated in this work. Overall, the\nprocedures prescribed in this work, together, lead to robust ML models for\nsmall data sets.",

In a different context, such relative\nmovements of the objects and/or the camera are routinely being used for image\nsuper-resolution applications; inspired by their success, we designed a\ntime-lapse diffractive network to benefit from the complementary information\ncontent created by controlled or random lateral shifts.

However, RL's role in understanding other neural processes\nespecially motor learning is much less well explored. To explore this\nconnection, we investigated how recent deep RL methods correspond to the\ndominant motor learning framework in neuroscience, error-based learning.\nError-based learning can be probed using a mirror reversal adaptation paradigm,\nwhere it produces distinctive qualitative predictions that are observed in\nhumans. We therefore tested three major families of modern deep RL algorithm on\na mirror reversal perturbation. Surprisingly, all of the algorithms failed to\nmimic human behaviour and indeed displayed qualitatively different behaviour\nfrom that predicted by error-based learning. To fill this gap, we introduce a\nnovel deep RL algorithm: model-based deterministic policy gradients (MB-DPG).\nMB-DPG draws inspiration from error-based learning by explicitly relying on the\nobserved outcome of actions. We show MB-DPG captures (human) error-based\nlearning under mirror-reversal and rotational perturbation. Next, we\ndemonstrate error-based learning in the form of MB-DPG learns faster than\ncanonical model-free algorithms on complex arm-based reaching tasks, while\nbeing more robust to (forward) model misspecification than model-based RL.\nThese findings highlight the gap between current deep RL methods and human\nmotor adaptation and offer a route to closing this gap, facilitating future\nbeneficial interaction between between the two fields.",

While tremendous\nprogress has been made in image sensors and computer vision over the past\ndecades, the tactile sense abilities are lagging behind due to the lack of\nlarge-scale flexible tactile sensor array with high sensitivity, high spatial\nresolution, and fast response. In this work, we have demonstrated a 64x64\nflexible tactile sensor array with a record-high spatial resolution of 0.9 mm\n(equivalently 28.2 pixels per inch), by integrating a high-performance\npiezoresistive film (PRF) with a large-area active matrix of carbon nanotube\nthin-film transistors. PRF with self-formed microstructures exhibited high\npressure-sensitivity of ~385 kPa-1 for MWCNTs concentration of 6%, while the\n14% one exhibited fast response time of ~3 ms, good linearity, broad detection\nrange beyond 1400 kPa, and excellent cyclability over 3000 cycles. Using this\nfully integrated tactile sensor array, the footprint maps of an artificial\nhoneybee were clearly identified. Furthermore, we hardware-implemented a smart\ntactile system by integrating the PRF-based sensor array with a memristor-based\ncomputing-in-memory chip to record and recognize handwritten digits and Chinese\ncalligraphy, achieving high classification accuracies of 98.8% and 97.3% in\nhardware, respectively.

    "abstract": "Cancer cell migration between different body parts is the driving force\nbehind cancer metastasis, which is the main cause of mortality of patients.\nMigration of cancer cells often proceeds by penetration through narrow cavities\nin locally stiff, yet flexible tissues. In our previous work, we developed a\nmodel for cell geometry evolution during invasion, which we extend here to\ninvestigate whether leader and follower (cancer) cells that only interact\nmechanically can benefit from sequential transmigration through narrow\nmicro-channels and cavities.\nWe consider two cases of cells sequentially migrating through a flexible\nchannel: leader and follower cells being closely adjacent or distant. Using\nWilcoxon's signed-rank test on the data collected from Monte Carlo simulations,\nwe conclude that the modelled transmigration speed for the follower cell is\nsignificantly larger than for the leader cell when cells are distant, i.e.\nfollower cells transmigrate after the leader has completed the crossing.\nFurthermore, it appears that there exists an optimum with respect to the width\nof the channel such that cell moves fastest. On the other hand, in the case of\nclosely adjacent cells, effectively performing collective migration, the leader\ncell moves $12\\%$ faster since the follower cell pushes it. This work shows\nthat mechanical interactions between cells can increase the net transmigration\nspeed of cancer cells, resulting in increased invasiveness. In other words,\ninteraction between cancer cells can accelerate metastatic invasion.",

    "abstract": "Chest computed tomography (CT) imaging adds valuable insight in the diagnosis\nand management of pulmonary infectious diseases, like tuberculosis (TB).\nHowever, due to the cost and resource limitations, only X-ray images may be\navailable for initial diagnosis or follow up comparison imaging during\ntreatment. Due to their projective nature, X-rays images may be more difficult\nto interpret by clinicians. The lack of publicly available paired X-ray and CT\nimage datasets makes it challenging to train a 3D reconstruction model. In\naddition, Chest X-ray radiology may rely on different device modalities with\nvarying image quality and there may be variation in underlying population\ndisease spectrum that creates diversity in inputs. We propose shape induction,\nthat is, learning the shape of 3D CT from X-ray without CT supervision, as a\nnovel technique to incorporate realistic X-ray distributions during training of\na reconstruction model. Our experiments demonstrate that this process improves\nboth the perceptual quality of generated CT and the accuracy of down-stream\nclassification of pulmonary infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Identifying reaction coordinates(RCs) is an active area of research, given\nthe crucial role RCs play in determining the progress of a chemical reaction.\nThe choice of the reaction coordinate is often based on heuristic knowledge.\nHowever, an essential criterion for the choice is that the coordinate should\ncapture both the reactant and product states unequivocally. Also, the\ncoordinate should be the slowest one so that all the other degrees of freedom\ncan easily equilibrate along the reaction coordinate. Also, the coordinate\nshould be the slowest one so that all the other degrees of freedom can easily\nequilibrate along the reaction coordinate. We used a regularised sparse\nautoencoder, an energy-based model, to discover a crucial set of reaction\ncoordinates. Along with discovering reaction coordinates, our model also\npredicts the evolution of a molecular dynamics(MD) trajectory. We showcased\nthat including sparsity enforcing regularisation helps in choosing a small but\nimportant set of reaction coordinates. We used two model systems to demonstrate\nour approach: alanine dipeptide system and proflavine and DNA system, which\nexhibited intercalation of proflavine into DNA minor groove in an aqueous\nenvironment. We model MD trajectory as a multivariate time series, and our\nlatent variable model performs the task of multi-step time series prediction.\nThis idea is inspired by the popular sparse coding approach - to represent each\ninput sample as a linear combination of few elements taken from a set of\nrepresentative patterns.",

However, this issue may be\nsignificantly mitigated by the application of automatic machine and deep\nlearning methods. We propose ULISSE, a new deep learning tool that, starting\nfrom a single prototype object, is capable of identifying objects sharing the\nsame morphological and photometric properties, and hence of creating a list of\ncandidate sosia. In this work, we focus on applying our method to the detection\nof AGN candidates in a Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy sample, since the\nidentification and classification of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the\noptical band still remains a challenging task in extragalactic astronomy.\nIntended for the initial exploration of large sky surveys, ULISSE directly uses\nfeatures extracted from the ImageNet dataset to perform a similarity search.\nThe method is capable of rapidly identifying a list of candidates, starting\nfrom only a single image of a given prototype, without the need for any\ntime-consuming neural network training. Our experiments show ULISSE is able to\nidentify AGN candidates based on a combination of host galaxy morphology, color\nand the presence of a central nuclear source, with a retrieval efficiency\nranging from 21% to 65% (including composite sources) depending on the\nprototype, where the random guess baseline is 12%. We find ULISSE to be most\neffective in retrieving AGN in early-type host galaxies, as opposed to\nprototypes with spiral- or late-type properties. Based on the results described\nin this work, ULISSE can be a promising tool for selecting different types of\nastrophysical objects in current and future wide-field surveys (e.g. Euclid,\nLSST etc.) that target millions of sources every single night.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised Anomaly Detection has become a popular method to detect\npathologies in medical images as it does not require supervision or labels for\ntraining. Most commonly, the anomaly detection model generates a \"normal\"\nversion of an input image, and the pixel-wise $l^p$-difference of the two is\nused to localize anomalies. However, large residuals often occur due to\nimperfect reconstruction of the complex anatomical structures present in most\nmedical images. This method also fails to detect anomalies that are not\ncharacterized by large intensity differences to the surrounding tissue. We\npropose to tackle this problem using a feature-mapping function that transforms\nthe input intensity images into a space with multiple channels where anomalies\ncan be detected along different discriminative feature maps extracted from the\noriginal image. We then train an Autoencoder model in this space using\nstructural similarity loss that does not only consider differences in intensity\nbut also in contrast and structure.

Due to the bilevel structure and\nprivate types, strategic MDP involves information asymmetry between the\nprincipal and the agents. We focus on the offline RL problem, where the goal is\nto learn the optimal policy of the principal concerning a target population of\nagents based on a pre-collected dataset that consists of historical\ninteractions. The unobserved private types confound such a dataset as they\naffect both the rewards and observations received by the principal.

    "abstract": "Kernel methods in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) have recently gained\nsignificant attention as a potential candidate for achieving a quantum\nadvantage in data analysis. Among other attractive properties, when training a\nkernel-based model one is guaranteed to find the optimal model's parameters due\nto the convexity of the training landscape. However, this is based on the\nassumption that the quantum kernel can be efficiently obtained from a quantum\nhardware. In this work we study the trainability of quantum kernels from the\nperspective of the resources needed to accurately estimate kernel values. We\nshow that, under certain conditions, values of quantum kernels over different\ninput data can be exponentially concentrated (in the number of qubits) towards\nsome fixed value, leading to an exponential scaling of the number of\nmeasurements required for successful training. We identify four sources that\ncan lead to concentration including: the expressibility of data embedding,\nglobal measurements, entanglement and noise. For each source, an associated\nconcentration bound of quantum kernels is analytically derived. Lastly, we show\nthat when dealing with classical data, training a parametrized data embedding\nwith a kernel alignment method is also susceptible to exponential\nconcentration. Our results are verified through numerical simulations for\nseveral QML tasks. Altogether, we provide guidelines indicating that certain\nfeatures should be avoided to ensure the efficient evaluation and the\ntrainability of quantum kernel methods.",
