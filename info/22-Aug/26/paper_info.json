    "abstract": "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are defined as a collection of highly\nstressful, and potentially traumatic, events or circumstances that occur\nthroughout childhood and/or adolescence. They have been shown to be associated\nwith increased risks of mental health diseases or other abnormal behaviours in\nlater lives. However, the identification of ACEs from textual data with Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) is challenging because (a) there are no NLP ready ACE\nontologies; (b) there are few resources available for machine learning,\nnecessitating the data annotation from clinical experts; (c) costly annotations\nby domain experts and large number of documents for supporting large machine\nlearning models. In this paper, we present an ontology-driven self-supervised\napproach (derive concept embeddings using an auto-encoder from baseline NLP\nresults) for producing a publicly available resource that would support\nlarge-scale machine learning (e.g., training transformer based large language\nmodels) on social media corpus. This resource as well as the proposed approach\nare aimed to facilitate the community in training transferable NLP models for\neffectively surfacing ACEs in low-resource scenarios like NLP on clinical notes\nwithin Electronic Health Records. The resource including a list of ACE ontology\nterms, ACE concept embeddings and the NLP annotated corpus is available at\nhttps://github.com/knowlab/ACE-NLP.",

    "abstract": "Measuring similarities between different tasks is critical in a broad\nspectrum of machine learning problems, including transfer, multi-task,\ncontinual, and meta-learning. Most current approaches to measuring task\nsimilarities are architecture-dependent: 1) relying on pre-trained models, or\n2) training networks on tasks and using forward transfer as a proxy for task\nsimilarity. In this paper, we leverage the optimal transport theory and define\na novel task embedding for supervised classification that is model-agnostic,\ntraining-free, and capable of handling (partially) disjoint label sets. In\nshort, given a dataset with ground-truth labels, we perform a label embedding\nthrough multi-dimensional scaling and concatenate dataset samples with their\ncorresponding label embeddings. Then, we define the distance between two\ndatasets as the 2-Wasserstein distance between their updated samples. Lastly,\nwe leverage the 2-Wasserstein embedding framework to embed tasks into a vector\nspace in which the Euclidean distance between the embedded points approximates\nthe proposed 2-Wasserstein distance between tasks. We show that the proposed\nembedding leads to a significantly faster comparison of tasks compared to\nrelated approaches like the Optimal Transport Dataset Distance (OTDD).\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed embedding through\nvarious numerical experiments and show statistically significant correlations\nbetween our proposed distance and the forward and backward transfer between\ntasks.",

    "abstract": "We present mathematical techniques for exhaustive studies of long-term\ndynamics of asynchronous biological system models. Specifically, we extend the\nnotion of $\\kappa$-equivalence developed for graph dynamical systems to support\nsystematic analysis of all possible attractor configurations that can be\ngenerated when varying the asynchronous update order (Macauley and Mortveit\n(2009)). We extend earlier work by Veliz-Cuba and Stigler (2011), Goles et al.\n(2014), and others by comparing long-term dynamics up to topological\nconjugation: rather than comparing the exact states and their transitions on\nattractors, we only compare the attractor structures. In general, obtaining\nthis information is computationally intractable. Here, we adapt and apply\ncombinatorial theory for dynamical systems to develop computational methods\nthat greatly reduce this computational cost. We give a detailed algorithm and\napply it to ($i$) the lac operon model for Escherichia coli proposed by\nVeliz-Cuba and Stigler (2011), and ($ii$) the regulatory network involved in\nthe control of the cell cycle and cell differentiation in the Caenorhabditis\nelegans vulva precursor cells proposed by Weinstein et al. (2015). In both\ncases, we uncover all possible limit cycle structures for these networks under\nsequential updates. Specifically, for the lac operon model, rather than\nexamining all $10! > 3.6 \\cdot 10^6$ sequential update orders, we demonstrate\nthat it is sufficient to consider $344$ representative update orders, and, more\nnotably, that these $344$ representatives give rise to $4$ distinct attractor\nstructures. A similar analysis performed for the C. elegans model demonstrates\nthat it has precisely $125$ distinct attractor structures. We conclude with\nobservations on the variety and distribution of the models' attractor\nstructures and use the results to discuss their robustness.",

    "abstract": "Cost-sensitive classification is critical in applications where\nmisclassification errors widely vary in cost. However, over-parameterization\nposes fundamental challenges to the cost-sensitive modeling of deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs). The ability of a DNN to fully interpolate a training dataset\ncan render a DNN, evaluated purely on the training set, ineffective in\ndistinguishing a cost-sensitive solution from its overall accuracy maximization\ncounterpart. This necessitates rethinking cost-sensitive classification in\nDNNs. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a cost-sensitive\nadversarial data augmentation (CSADA) framework to make over-parameterized\nmodels cost-sensitive. The overarching idea is to generate targeted adversarial\nexamples that push the decision boundary in cost-aware directions. These\ntargeted adversarial samples are generated by maximizing the probability of\ncritical misclassifications and used to train a model with more conservative\ndecisions on costly pairs. Experiments on well-known datasets and a pharmacy\nmedication image (PMI) dataset made publicly available show that our method can\neffectively minimize the overall cost and reduce critical errors, while\nachieving comparable performance in terms of overall accuracy.",

A particularly successful example is the GLUE dataset\nfor training and evaluating Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models for\nEnglish. The large body of research around self-supervised BERT-based language\nmodels revolved around performance improvements on NLU tasks in GLUE. To\nevaluate language models in other languages, several language-specific GLUE\ndatasets were created. The area of speech language understanding (SLU) has\nfollowed a similar trajectory. The success of large self-supervised models such\nas wav2vec2 enable creation of speech models with relatively easy to access\nunlabelled data. These models can then be evaluated on SLU tasks, such as the\nSUPERB benchmark. In this work, we extend this to Indic languages by releasing\nthe IndicSUPERB benchmark. Specifically, we make the following three\ncontributions. (i) We collect Kathbath containing 1,684 hours of labelled\nspeech data across 12 Indian languages from 1,218 contributors located in 203\ndistricts in India. (ii) Using Kathbath, we create benchmarks across 6 speech\ntasks: Automatic Speech Recognition, Speaker Verification, Speaker\nIdentification (mono/multi), Language Identification, Query By Example, and\nKeyword Spotting for 12 languages. (iii) On the released benchmarks, we train\nand evaluate different self-supervised models alongside a commonly used\nbaseline FBANK. We show that language-specific fine-tuned models are more\naccurate than baseline on most of the tasks, including a large gap of 76\\% for\nthe Language Identification task.

    "title": "Sampling and Optimal Preference Elicitation in Simple Mechanisms",
    "abstract": "In this work we are concerned with the design of efficient mechanisms while\neliciting limited information from the agents. First, we study the performance\nof sampling approximations in facility location games. Our key result is to\nshow that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, a sample of size $c(\\epsilon) =\n\\Theta(1/\\epsilon^2)$ yields in expectation a $1 + \\epsilon$ approximation with\nrespect to the optimal social cost of the generalized median mechanism on the\nmetric space $(\\mathbb{R}^d, \\| \\cdot \\|_1)$, while the number of agents $n \\to\n\\infty$. Moreover, we study a series of exemplar environments from auction\ntheory through a communication complexity framework, measuring the expected\nnumber of bits elicited from the agents; we posit that any valuation can be\nexpressed with $k$ bits, and we mainly assume that $k$ is independent of the\nnumber of agents $n$. In this context, we show that Vickrey's rule can be\nimplemented with an expected communication of $1 + \\epsilon$ bits from an\naverage bidder, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, asymptotically matching the trivial\nlower bound. As a corollary, we provide a compelling method to increment the\nprice in an English auction. We also leverage our single-item format with an\nefficient encoding scheme to prove that the same communication bound can be\nrecovered in the domain of additive valuations through simultaneous ascending\nauctions, assuming that the number of items is a constant. Finally, we propose\nan ascending-type multi-unit auction under unit demand bidders; our mechanism\nannounces at every round two separate prices and is based on a sampling\nalgorithm that performs approximate selection with limited communication,\nleading again to asymptotically optimal communication. Our results do not\nrequire any prior knowledge on the agents' valuations, and mainly follow from\nnatural sampling techniques.",

    "abstract": "Token uniformity is commonly observed in transformer-based models, in which\ndifferent tokens share a large proportion of similar information after going\nthrough stacked multiple self-attention layers in a transformer. In this paper,\nwe propose to use the distribution of singular values of outputs of each\ntransformer layer to characterise the phenomenon of token uniformity and\nempirically illustrate that a less skewed singular value distribution can\nalleviate the `token uniformity' problem. Base on our observations, we define\nseveral desirable properties of singular value distributions and propose a\nnovel transformation function for updating the singular values. We show that\napart from alleviating token uniformity, the transformation function should\npreserve the local neighbourhood structure in the original embedding space. Our\nproposed singular value transformation function is applied to a range of\ntransformer-based language models such as BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa and DistilBERT,\nand improved performance is observed in semantic textual similarity evaluation\nand a range of GLUE tasks.

Inserting an item into a pairing heap or decreasing the key\nof an item takes O(1) time worst-case, as does melding two heaps. But deleting\nan item of minimum key can take time linear in the heap size in the worst case.\nThe paper that introduced the pairing heap proved an O(log n) amortized time\nbound for each heap operation, where n is the number of items in the heap or\nheaps involved in the operation, by charging all but O(log n) of the time for\neach deletion to non-deletion operations, O(log n) to each. Later Iacono found\na way to reduce the amortized time per insertion to O(1) and that of meld to\nzero while preserving the O(log n) amortized time bound for the other update\noperations.

    "abstract": "Existing video denoising methods typically assume noisy videos are degraded\nfrom clean videos by adding Gaussian noise. However, deep models trained on\nsuch a degradation assumption will inevitably give rise to poor performance for\nreal videos due to degradation mismatch. Although some studies attempt to train\ndeep models on noisy and noise-free video pairs captured by cameras, such\nmodels can only work well for specific cameras and do not generalize well for\nother videos. In this paper, we propose to lift this limitation and focus on\nthe problem of general real video denoising with the aim to generalize well on\nunseen real-world videos. We tackle this problem by firstly investigating the\ncommon behaviors of video noises and observing two important characteristics:\n1) downscaling helps to reduce the noise level in spatial space and 2) the\ninformation from the adjacent frames help to remove the noise of current frame\nin temporal space. Motivated by these two observations, we propose a\nmulti-scale recurrent architecture by making full use of the above two\ncharacteristics. Secondly, we propose a synthetic real noise degradation model\nby randomly shuffling different noise types to train the denoising model. With\na synthesized and enriched degradation space, our degradation model can help to\nbridge the distribution gap between training data and real-world data.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance and better generalization ability than existing\nmethods on both synthetic Gaussian denoising and practical real video\ndenoising.",

Existing solutions rarely explore valuable\nbody-component relations in skeletal structure or motion, and they typically\nlack the ability to learn general representations with unlabeled skeleton data\nfor person re-ID. This paper proposes a generic unsupervised Skeleton Prototype\nContrastive learning paradigm with Multi-level Graph Relation learning\n(SPC-MGR) to learn effective representations from unlabeled skeletons to\nperform person re-ID. Specifically, we first construct unified multi-level\nskeleton graphs to fully model body structure within skeletons. Then we propose\na multi-head structural relation layer to comprehensively capture relations of\nphysically-connected body-component nodes in graphs. A full-level collaborative\nrelation layer is exploited to infer collaboration between motion-related body\nparts at various levels, so as to capture rich body features and recognizable\nwalking patterns. Lastly, we propose a skeleton prototype contrastive learning\nscheme that clusters feature-correlative instances of unlabeled graph\nrepresentations and contrasts their inherent similarity with representative\nskeleton features (\"skeleton prototypes\") to learn discriminative skeleton\nrepresentations for person re-ID. Empirical evaluations show that SPC-MGR\nsignificantly outperforms several state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods, and\nit also achieves highly competitive person re-ID performance for more general\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Recent works in self-supervised learning have demonstrated strong performance\non scene-level dense prediction tasks by pretraining with object-centric or\nregion-based correspondence objectives. In this paper, we present\nRegion-to-Object Representation Learning (R2O) which unifies region-based and\nobject-centric pretraining. R2O operates by training an encoder to dynamically\nrefine region-based segments into object-centric masks and then jointly learns\nrepresentations of the contents within the mask. R2O uses a \"region refinement\nmodule\" to group small image regions, generated using a region-level prior,\ninto larger regions which tend to correspond to objects by clustering\nregion-level features. As pretraining progresses, R2O follows a\nregion-to-object curriculum which encourages learning region-level features\nearly on and gradually progresses to train object-centric representations.\nRepresentations learned using R2O lead to state-of-the art performance in\nsemantic segmentation for PASCAL VOC (+0.7 mIOU) and Cityscapes (+0.4 mIOU) and\ninstance segmentation on MS COCO (+0.3 mask AP).

This paper proposes a novel pipeline for learning non-Markovian task\nspecifications as succinct finite-state `task automata' from episodes of agent\nexperience within unknown environments. We leverage two key algorithmic\ninsights. First, we learn a product MDP, a model composed of the\nspecification's automaton and the environment's MDP (both initially unknown),\nby treating it as a partially observable MDP and using off-the-shelf algorithms\nfor hidden Markov models. Second, we propose a novel method for distilling the\ntask automaton (assumed to be a deterministic finite automaton) from the learnt\nproduct MDP. Our learnt task automaton enables the decomposition of a task into\nits constituent sub-tasks, which improves the rate at which an RL agent can\nlater synthesise an optimal policy. It also provides an interpretable encoding\nof high-level environmental and task features, so a human can readily verify\nthat the agent has learnt coherent tasks with no misspecifications. In\naddition, we take steps towards ensuring that the learnt automaton is\nenvironment-agnostic, making it well-suited for use in transfer learning.\nFinally, we provide experimental results to illustrate our algorithm's\nperformance in different environments and tasks and its ability to incorporate\nprior domain knowledge to facilitate more efficient learning.",

    "abstract": "Image inpainting is an ill-posed problem to recover missing or damaged image\ncontent based on incomplete images with masks. Previous works usually predict\nthe auxiliary structures (e.g., edges, segmentation and contours) to help fill\nvisually realistic patches in a multi-stage fashion. However, imprecise\nauxiliary priors may yield biased inpainted results. Besides, it is\ntime-consuming for some methods to be implemented by multiple stages of complex\nneural networks. To solve this issue, we develop an end-to-end multi-modality\nguided transformer network, including one inpainting branch and two auxiliary\nbranches for semantic segmentation and edge textures. Within each transformer\nblock, the proposed multi-scale spatial-aware attention module can learn the\nmulti-modal structural features efficiently via auxiliary denormalization.\nDifferent from previous methods relying on direct guidance from biased priors,\nour method enriches semantically consistent context in an image based on\ndiscriminative interplay information from multiple modalities. Comprehensive\nexperiments on several challenging image inpainting datasets show that our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art performance to deal with various\nregular/irregular masks efficiently.",

Learning rate schedules are\nwidely used in real practice to adjust the learning rate according to\npre-defined schedules for fast convergence and good generalization. However,\nexisting learning rate schedules are all heuristic algorithms and lack\ntheoretical support. Therefore, people usually choose the learning rate\nschedules through multiple ad-hoc trials, and the obtained learning rate\nschedules are sub-optimal. To boost the performance of the obtained sub-optimal\nlearning rate schedule, we propose a generic learning rate schedule plugin,\ncalled LEArning Rate Perturbation (LEAP), which can be applied to various\nlearning rate schedules to improve the model training by introducing a certain\nperturbation to the learning rate. We found that, with such a simple yet\neffective strategy, training processing exponentially favors flat minima rather\nthan sharp minima with guaranteed convergence, which leads to better\ngeneralization ability. In addition, we conduct extensive experiments which\nshow that training with LEAP can improve the performance of various deep\nlearning models on diverse datasets using various learning rate schedules\n(including constant learning rate).",

    "abstract": "Prior studies on intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) have mostly considered\nwireless communication systems aided by a single passive IRS, which, however,\nhas limited control over wireless propagation environment and suffers from\nproduct-distance path-loss. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a\nnew hybrid active/passive IRS aided wireless communication system, where an\nactive IRS and multiple passive IRSs are deployed to assist the communication\nbetween a base station (BS) and a remote user in complex environment, by\nestablishing a multihop reflection path across active/passive IRSs. In\nparticular, the active IRS enables signal reflection with power amplification,\nthus effectively compensating the severe path-loss in the multi-reflection\npath. To maximize the achievable rate at the user, we first design the optimal\nbeamforming of the BS and selected (active/passive) IRSs for a given\nmulti-reflection path, and then propose an efficient algorithm to obtain the\noptimal multi-reflection path by using the path decomposition method and graph\ntheory. We show that the active IRS should be selected to establish the beam\nrouting path when its amplification power and/or number of active reflecting\nelements are sufficiently large. Last, numerical results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed hybrid active/passive IRS beam routing design as\ncompared to the benchmark scheme with passive IRSs only.",

In the automotive space, IEEE 802.3bw (commonly\nreferred to as automotive ethernet) is quickly becoming the most popular\nin-vehicle communication protocol between electronic control units (ECUs).

    "abstract": "Conventional neural structures tend to communicate through analog quantities\nsuch as currents or voltages, however, as CMOS devices shrink and supply\nvoltages decrease, the dynamic range of voltage/current-domain analog circuits\nbecomes narrower, the available margin becomes smaller, and noise immunity\ndecreases. More than that, the use of operational amplifiers (op-amps) and\nclocked or asynchronous comparators in conventional designs leads to high\nenergy consumption and large chip area, which would be detrimental to building\nspiking neural networks. In view of this, we propose a neural structure for\ngenerating and transmitting time-domain signals, including a neuron module, a\nsynapse module, and two weight modules. The proposed neural structure is driven\nby leakage currents in the transistor triode region and does not use op-amps\nand comparators, thus providing higher energy and area efficiency compared to\nconventional designs. In addition, the structure provides greater noise\nimmunity due to internal communication via time-domain signals, which\nsimplifies the wiring between the modules. The proposed neural structure is\nfabricated using TSMC 65 nm CMOS technology. The proposed neuron and synapse\noccupy an area of 127 um2 and 231 um2, respectively, while achieving\nmillisecond time constants.

    "abstract": "What can we learn about a scene by watching it for months or years? A video\nrecorded over a long timespan will depict interesting phenomena at multiple\ntimescales, but identifying and viewing them presents a challenge. The video is\ntoo long to watch in full, and some occurrences are too slow to experience in\nreal-time, such as glacial retreat. Timelapse videography is a common approach\nto summarizing long videos and visualizing slow timescales. However, a\ntimelapse is limited to a single chosen temporal frequency, and often appears\nflickery due to aliasing and temporal discontinuities between frames. In this\npaper, we propose Video Temporal Pyramids, a technique that addresses these\nlimitations and expands the possibilities for visualizing the passage of time.\nInspired by spatial image pyramids from computer vision, we developed an\nalgorithm that builds video pyramids in the temporal domain. Each level of a\nVideo Temporal Pyramid visualizes a different timescale; for instance, videos\nfrom the monthly timescale are usually good for visualizing seasonal changes,\nwhile videos from the one-minute timescale are best for visualizing sunrise or\nthe movement of clouds across the sky. To help explore the different pyramid\nlevels, we also propose a Video Spectrogram to visualize the amount of activity\nacross the entire pyramid, providing a holistic overview of the scene dynamics\nand the ability to explore and discover phenomena across time and timescales.\nTo demonstrate our approach, we have built Video Temporal Pyramids from ten\noutdoor scenes, each containing months or years of data.

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is a promising technology with enormous\napplications in almost every walk of life. One of the crucial applications of\nWSNs is intrusion detection and surveillance at the border areas and in the\ndefense establishments. The border areas are stretched in hundreds to thousands\nof miles, hence, it is not possible to patrol the entire border region. As a\nresult, an enemy may enter from any point absence of surveillance and cause the\nloss of lives or destroy the military establishments. WSNs can be a feasible\nsolution for the problem of intrusion detection and surveillance at the border\nareas. Detection of an enemy at the border areas and nearby critical areas such\nas military cantonments is a time-sensitive task as a delay of few seconds may\nhave disastrous consequences. Therefore, it becomes imperative to design\nsystems that are able to identify and detect the enemy as soon as it comes in\nthe range of the deployed system. In this paper, we have proposed a deep\nlearning architecture based on a fully connected feed-forward Artificial Neural\nNetwork (ANN) for the accurate prediction of the number of k-barriers for fast\nintrusion detection and prevention. We have trained and evaluated the\nfeed-forward ANN model using four potential features, namely area of the\ncircular region, sensing range of sensors, the transmission range of sensors,\nand the number of sensor for Gaussian and uniform sensor distribution. These\nfeatures are extracted through Monte Carlo simulation. In doing so, we found\nthat the model accurately predicts the number of k-barriers for both Gaussian\nand uniform sensor distribution with correlation coefficient (R = 0.78) and\nRoot Mean Square Error (RMSE = 41.15) for the former and R = 0.79 and RMSE =\n48.36 for the latter. Further, the proposed approach outperforms the other\nbenchmark algorithms in terms of accuracy and computational time complexity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract-Over the past few years, there has been an increased interest in\nincluding FPGAs in data centers and high-performance computing clusters along\nwith GPUs and other accelerators. As a result, it has become increasingly\nimportant to have a unified, high-level programming interface for CPUs, GPUs\nand FPGAs. This has led to the development of compiler toolchains to deploy\nOpenCL code on FPGA. However, the fundamental architectural differences between\nGPUs and FPGAs have led to performance portability issues: it has been shown\nthat OpenCL code optimized for GPU does not necessarily map well to FPGA, often\nrequiring manual optimizations to improve performance. In this paper, we\nexplore the use of thread coarsening - a compiler technique that consolidates\nthe work of multiple threads into a single thread - on OpenCL code running on\nFPGA. While this optimization has been explored on CPU and GPU, the\narchitectural features of FPGAs and the nature of the parallelism they offer\nlead to different performance considerations, making an analysis of thread\ncoarsening on FPGA worthwhile. Our evaluation, performed on our microbenchmarks\nand on a set of applications from open-source benchmark suites, shows that\nthread coarsening can yield performance benefits (up to 3-4x speedups) to\nOpenCL code running on FPGA at a limited resource utilization cost.",

    "abstract": "Most digital audio tampering detection methods based on electrical network\nfrequency (ENF) only utilize the static spatial information of ENF, ignoring\nthe variation of ENF in time series, which limit the ability of ENF feature\nrepresentation and reduce the accuracy of tampering detection. This paper\nproposes a new method for digital audio tampering detection based on ENF\nspatio-temporal features representation learning. A parallel spatio-temporal\nnetwork model is constructed using CNN and BiLSTM, which deeply extracts ENF\nspatial feature information and ENF temporal feature information to enhance the\nfeature representation capability to improve the tampering detection accuracy.\nIn order to extract the spatial and temporal features of the ENF, this paper\nfirstly uses digital audio high-precision Discrete Fourier Transform analysis\nto extract the phase sequences of the ENF. The unequal phase series is divided\ninto frames by adaptive frame shifting to obtain feature matrices of the same\nsize to represent the spatial features of the ENF. At the same time, the phase\nsequences are divided into frames based on ENF time changes information to\nrepresent the temporal features of the ENF. Then deep spatial and temporal\nfeatures are further extracted using CNN and BiLSTM respectively, and an\nattention mechanism is used to adaptively assign weights to the deep spatial\nand temporal features to obtain spatio-temporal features with stronger\nrepresentation capability. Finally, the deep neural network is used to\ndetermine whether the audio has been tampered with. The experimental results\nshow that the proposed method improves the accuracy by 2.12%-7.12% compared\nwith state-of-the-art methods under the public database Carioca, New Spanish.",

At the\nstate of the art, many failures can be predicted from anomalous combinations of\nsystem metrics with respect to either rules provided from domain experts or\nsupervised learning models.

Rounding, the primary\nsource of quantization error, is optimized only for model weights, while\nactivations still use the rounding-to-nearest operation. In this work, for the\nfirst time, we demonstrate that well-chosen rounding schemes for activations\ncan improve the final accuracy. To deal with the challenge of the dynamicity of\nthe activation rounding scheme, we adaptively adjust the rounding border\nthrough a simple function to generate rounding schemes at the inference stage.\nThe border function covers the impact of weight errors, activation errors, and\npropagated errors to eliminate the bias of the element-wise error, which\nfurther benefits model accuracy. We also make the border aware of global errors\nto better fit different arriving activations. Finally, we propose the AQuant\nframework to learn the border function. Extensive experiments show that AQuant\nachieves noticeable improvements with negligible overhead compared with\nstate-of-the-art works and pushes the accuracy of ResNet-18 up to 60.3\\% under\nthe 2-bit weight and activation post-training quantization.",

Recently, IMU-vision\nsensor fusion is regarded as valuable for solving these problems. However,\nprevious researches on the fusion of IMU and vision data, which is\nheterogeneous, fail to adequately utilize either IMU raw data or reliable\nhigh-level vision features. To facilitate a more efficient sensor fusion, in\nthis work we propose a framework called \\emph{FusePose} under a parametric\nhuman kinematic model. Specifically, we aggregate different information of IMU\nor vision data and introduce three distinctive sensor fusion approaches:\nNaiveFuse, KineFuse and AdaDeepFuse. NaiveFuse servers as a basic approach that\nonly fuses simplified IMU data and estimated 3D pose in euclidean space. While\nin kinematic space, KineFuse is able to integrate the calibrated and aligned\nIMU raw data with converted 3D pose parameters. AdaDeepFuse further develops\nthis kinematical fusion process to an adaptive and end-to-end trainable manner.\nComprehensive experiments with ablation studies demonstrate the rationality and\nsuperiority of the proposed framework. The performance of 3D human pose\nestimation is improved compared to the baseline result. On Total Capture\ndataset, KineFuse surpasses previous state-of-the-art which uses IMU only for\ntesting by 8.6\\%.

    "abstract": "The big data processing in distributed Internet of Things (IoT) systems calls\nfor innovative computing architectures and resource provisioning techniques to\nsupport real-time and cost-effective computing services. This article\nintroduces a novel overbooking-promoted forward trading mechanism named\nOverbook in Advance, Trade in Future (OATF), where computing resources can be\ntraded across three parties, i.e. end-users, an edge server and a remote cloud\nserver, under a hybrid device-edge-cloud network with uncertainties (e.g., \"no\nshows\"). More importantly, OATF encourages a feasible overbooking rate that\nallows the edge server to overbook resources to multiple end-users (e.g.,\nexceed the resource supply), while purchasing backup resources from the cloud\nserver, by determining rights and obligations associated with forward contracts\nin advance via analyzing historical statistics (e.g., network, resource\ndynamics). Such a mechanism can greatly improve time efficiency and resource\nutilization thanks to overbooking and pre-signed forward contracts. Critical\nissues such as overbooking rate design and risk management are carefully\ninvestigated in this article, while an interesting case study is proposed with\nmathematical analysis. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that OATF achieves\nmutually beneficial utilities for different parties (cloud, edge, and\nend-users), as well as substantial resource usage and commendable time\nefficiency, in comparison with conventional trading methods.",

    "abstract": "In multi-person 2D pose estimation, the bottom-up methods simultaneously\npredict poses for all persons, and unlike the top-down methods, do not rely on\nhuman detection. However, the SOTA bottom-up methods' accuracy is still\ninferior compared to the existing top-down methods. This is due to the\npredicted human poses being regressed based on the inconsistent human bounding\nbox center and the lack of human-scale normalization, leading to the predicted\nhuman poses being inaccurate and small-scale persons being missed. To push the\nenvelope of the bottom-up pose estimation, we firstly propose multi-scale\ntraining to enhance the network to handle scale variation with single-scale\ntesting, particularly for small-scale persons. Secondly, we introduce dual\nanatomical centers (i.e., head and body), where we can predict the human poses\nmore accurately and reliably, especially for small-scale persons. Moreover,\nexisting bottom-up methods use multi-scale testing to boost the accuracy of\npose estimation at the price of multiple additional forward passes, which\nweakens the efficiency of bottom-up methods, the core strength compared to\ntop-down methods. By contrast, our multi-scale training enables the model to\npredict high-quality poses in a single forward pass (i.e., single-scale\ntesting). Our method achieves 38.4\\% improvement on bounding box precision and\n39.1\\% improvement on bounding box recall over the state of the art (SOTA) on\nthe challenging small-scale persons subset of COCO. For the human pose AP\nevaluation, we achieve a new SOTA (71.0 AP) on the COCO test-dev set with the\nsingle-scale testing.

    "abstract": "Several novel industrial applications involve human control of vehicles,\ncranes, or mobile robots through various high-throughput feedback systems, such\nas Virtual Reality (VR) and tactile/haptic signals. The near real-time\ninteraction between the system and the operator requires strict latency\nconstraints in packet exchange, which is difficult to guarantee over wireless\ncommunication links. In this work, we advocate that packet-level coding and\npacket scheduling over multiple parallel (unreliable) links have the potential\nto provide reliable, latency-bounded communication for applications with\nperiodic data generation patterns. However, this goal can be reached only\nthrough a careful joint design of such mechanisms, whose interactions can be\nsubtle and difficult to predict. In this paper we first discuss these aspects\nin general terms, and then present a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that\ncan be used to find a scheme that optimally exploits the multichannel wireless\naccess in order to maximize the fraction of data blocks delivered within\ndeadline. Our illustrative example is then used to show the optimal\ncoding/scheduling strategies under different combinations of wireless links,\nalso showing that the common solution of backing up a high bitrate unreliable\nmmWave link with a low bitrate more stable sub-6 GHz link can actually be\nineffective in the considered scenario",

    "abstract": "Fall detection and classification become an imper- ative problem for\nhealthcare applications particularity with the increasingly ageing population.\nCurrently, most of the fall clas- sification algorithms provide binary fall or\nno-fall classification. For better healthcare, it is thus not enough to do\nbinary fall classification but to extend it to multiple fall events\nclassification. In this work, we utilize the privacy mitigating human skeleton\ndata for multiple fall events classification. The skeleton features are\nextracted from the original RGB images to not only mitigate the personal\nprivacy, but also to reduce the impact of the dynamic illuminations. The\nproposed fall events classification method is divided into two stages. In the\nfirst stage, the model is trained to achieve the binary classification to\nfilter out the no-fall events. Then, in the second stage, the deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) model is trained to further classify the five types of fall\nevents. In order to confirm the efficiency of the proposed method, the\nexperiments on the UP-Fall dataset outperform the state-of-the-art.",

Based on the results obtained in the first phase, to\nmodel the thermodynamic performance of the aforementioned engine cycle,\nFlight-Mach number and flight altitude are considered to be 2.5 and 30,000 m,\nrespectively; due to the operational advantage of supersonic flying at high\naltitude flight conditions, and the higher thrust of hydrogen fuel.\nAccordingly, in the second phase, taking into account the mentioned flight\nconditions, an intelligent model has been obtained to predict output parameters\n(i.e., thrust, thrust specific fuel consumption, and overall exergetic\nefficiency) using the deep learning method. In the attained deep neural model,\nthe pressure ratio of the high-pressure turbine, fan pressure ratio, turbine\ninlet temperature, intake air temperature, and bypass ratio are considered\ninput parameters. The provided datasets are randomly divided into two sets: the\nfirst one contains 6079 samples for model training and the second set contains\n1520 samples for testing. In particular, the Adam optimization algorithm, the\ncost function of the mean square error, and the active function of rectified\nlinear unit are used to train the network. The results show that the error\npercentage of the deep neural model is equal to 5.02%, 1.43%, and 2.92% to\npredict thrust, thrust specific fuel consumption, and overall exergetic\nefficiency, respectively, which indicates the success of the attained model in\nestimating the output parameters of the present problem.",

The rapid evolution of the\ncurrent threat landscape has seen many organisations share CTI to strengthen\ntheir security posture for mutual benefit. However, in many cases, CTI data\ncontains attributes (e.g., software versions) that have the potential to leak\nsensitive information or cause reputational damage to the sharing organisation.\nWhile current approaches allow restricting CTI sharing to trusted\norganisations, they lack solutions where the shared data can be verified and\ndisseminated `differentially' (i.e., selective information sharing) with\npolicies and metrics flexibly defined by an organisation. In this paper, we\npropose a blockchain-based CTI sharing framework that allows organisations to\nshare sensitive CTI data in a trusted, verifiable and differential manner.

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of tracking a large-scale number of group\ntargets. Usually, multi-target in most tracking scenarios are assumed to have\nindependent motion and are well-separated. However, for group target tracking\n(GTT), the targets within groups are closely spaced and move in a coordinated\nmanner, the groups can split or merge, and the numbers of targets in groups may\nbe large, which lead to more challenging data association, filtering and\ncomputation problems. Within the belief propagation (BP) framework, we propose\na scalable group target belief propagation (GTBP) method by jointly inferring\ntarget existence variables, group structure, data association and target\nstates. The method can efficiently calculate the approximations of the marginal\nposterior distributions of these variables by performing belief propagation on\nthe devised factor graph. As a consequence, GTBP is capable of capturing the\nchanges in group structure, e.g., group splitting and merging. Furthermore, we\nmodel the evolution of targets as the co-action of the group or single-target\nmotions specified by the possible group structures and corresponding\nprobabilities. This flexible modeling enables seamless and simultaneous\ntracking of multiple group targets and ungrouped targets. Particularly, GTBP\nhas excellent scalability and low computational complexity. It not only\nmaintains the same scalability as BP, i.e., scaling linearly in the number of\nsensor measurements and quadratically in the number of targets, but also only\nscales linearly in the number of preserved group partitions. Finally, numerical\nexperiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of\nthe proposed GTBP method.",

    "abstract": "VQA is an ambitious task aiming to answer any image-related question.\nHowever, in reality, it is hard to build such a system once for all since the\nneeds of users are continuously updated, and the system has to implement new\nfunctions. Thus, Continual Learning (CL) ability is a must in developing\nadvanced VQA systems. Recently, a pioneer work split a VQA dataset into\ndisjoint answer sets to study this topic. However, CL on VQA involves not only\nthe expansion of label sets (new Answer sets). It is crucial to study how to\nanswer questions when deploying VQA systems to new environments (new Visual\nscenes) and how to answer questions requiring new functions (new Question\ntypes). Thus, we propose CLOVE, a benchmark for Continual Learning On Visual\nquEstion answering, which contains scene- and function-incremental settings for\nthe two aforementioned CL scenarios. In terms of methodology, the main\ndifference between CL on VQA and classification is that the former additionally\ninvolves expanding and preventing forgetting of reasoning mechanisms, while the\nlatter focusing on class representation. Thus, we propose a real-data-free\nreplay-based method tailored for CL on VQA, named Scene Graph as Prompt for\nSymbolic Replay. Using a piece of scene graph as a prompt, it replays pseudo\nscene graphs to represent the past images, along with correlated QA pairs. A\nunified VQA model is also proposed to utilize the current and replayed data to\nenhance its QA ability. Finally, experimental results reveal challenges in\nCLOVE and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The dataset and code\nwill be available at https://github.com/showlab/CLVQA.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving\ndistributed machine learning framework recently. It aims at collaboratively\nlearning a shared global model by performing distributed training locally on\nedge devices and aggregating local models into a global one without centralized\nraw data sharing in the cloud server. However, due to the large local data\nheterogeneities (Non-I.I.D. data) across edge devices, the FL may easily obtain\na global model that can produce more shifted gradients on local datasets,\nthereby degrading the model performance or even suffering from the\nnon-convergence during training. In this paper, we propose a novel FL training\nframework, dubbed Fed-FSNet, using a properly designed Fuzzy Synthesizing\nNetwork (FSNet) to mitigate the Non-I.I.D. FL at-the-source. Concretely, we\nmaintain an edge-agnostic hidden model in the cloud server to estimate a\nless-accurate while direction-aware inversion of the global model. The hidden\nmodel can then fuzzily synthesize several mimic I.I.D. data samples (sample\nfeatures) conditioned on only the global model, which can be shared by edge\ndevices to facilitate the FL training towards faster and better convergence.\nMoreover, since the synthesizing process involves neither access to the\nparameters/updates of local models nor analyzing individual local model\noutputs, our framework can still ensure the privacy of FL. Experimental results\non several FL benchmarks demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate\nthe Non-I.I.D. issue and obtain better performance against other representative\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently received much\nattention due to their capabilities in solving both forward and inverse\nproblems. For training a deep neural network associated with a PINN, one\ntypically constructs a total loss function using a weighted sum of different\nloss terms and then tries to minimize that. This approach often becomes\nproblematic for solving stiff equations since it cannot consider adaptive\nincrements. Many studies reported the poor performance of the PINN and its\nchallenges in simulating stiff chemical active issues with administering\nconditions of stiff ordinary differential conditions (ODEs). Studies show that\nstiffness is the primary cause of the failure of the PINN in simulating stiff\nkinetic systems.\nHere, we address this issue by proposing a reduced weak-form of the loss\nfunction, which led to a new PINN architecture, further named as Reduced-PINN,\nthat utilizes a reduced-order integration method to enable the PINN to solve\nstiff chemical kinetics. The proposed Reduced-PINN can be applied to various\nreaction-diffusion systems involving stiff dynamics. To this end, we transform\ninitial value problems (IVPs) to their equivalent integral forms and solve the\nresulting integral equations using physics-informed neural networks. In our\nderived integral-based optimization process, there is only one term without\nexplicitly incorporating loss terms associated with ordinary differential\nequation (ODE) and initial conditions (ICs). To illustrate the capabilities of\nReduced-PINN, we used it to simulate multiple stiff/mild second-order ODEs. We\nshow that Reduced-PINN captures the solution accurately for a stiff scalar ODE.\nWe also validated the Reduced-PINN against a stiff system of linear ODEs.",

We introduce three objectives: 1) a\ndice consistency loss that enforces similarity between the overall head shape\nof the source and rendered image, 2) a scale consistency loss to ensure that\nhead shape is accurately reproduced even if the upper part of the head is not\nvisible, and 3) a 71 landmark detector trained using a moving average loss\nfunction to detect additional landmarks on the head. These objectives are used\nto train an encoder in an unsupervised manner to regress FLAME parameters from\nin-the-wild input images. Our unsupervised 3DMM model achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on popular benchmarks and can be used to infer the head shape, facial\nfeatures, and textures for direct use in animation or avatar creation.",

    "abstract": "Environmental perception with multi-modal fusion of radar and camera is\ncrucial in autonomous driving to increase the accuracy, completeness, and\nrobustness. This paper focuses on how to utilize millimeter-wave (MMW) radar\nand camera sensor fusion for 3D object detection. A novel method which realizes\nthe feature-level fusion under bird-eye view (BEV) for a better feature\nrepresentation is proposed. Firstly, radar features are augmented with temporal\naccumulation and sent to a temporal-spatial encoder for radar feature\nextraction. Meanwhile, multi-scale image 2D features which adapt to various\nspatial scales are obtained by image backbone and neck model. Then, image\nfeatures are transformed to BEV with the designed view transformer. In\naddition, this work fuses the multi-modal features with a two-stage fusion\nmodel called point fusion and ROI fusion, respectively. Finally, a detection\nhead regresses objects category and 3D locations. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method realizes the state-of-the-art performance\nunder the most important detection metrics, mean average precision (mAP) and\nnuScenes detection score (NDS) on the challenging nuScenes dataset.",

    "abstract": "Selective classification allows models to abstain from making predictions\n(e.g., say \"I don't know\") when in doubt in order to obtain better effective\naccuracy. While typical selective models can be effective at producing more\naccurate predictions on average, they may still allow for wrong predictions\nthat have high confidence, or skip correct predictions that have low\nconfidence. Providing calibrated uncertainty estimates alongside predictions --\nprobabilities that correspond to true frequencies -- can be as important as\nhaving predictions that are simply accurate on average. However, uncertainty\nestimates can be unreliable for certain inputs. In this paper, we develop a new\napproach to selective classification in which we propose a method for rejecting\nexamples with \"uncertain\" uncertainties. By doing so, we aim to make\npredictions with {well-calibrated} uncertainty estimates over the distribution\nof accepted examples, a property we call selective calibration. We present a\nframework for learning selectively calibrated models, where a separate selector\nnetwork is trained to improve the selective calibration error of a given base\nmodel. In particular, our work focuses on achieving robust calibration, where\nthe model is intentionally designed to be tested on out-of-domain data. We\nachieve this through a training strategy inspired by distributionally robust\noptimization, in which we apply simulated input perturbations to the known,\nin-domain training data.

The focus will be on two problems from\nGr\\\"unbaum's monograph from the 1970's.\nFirst, we discuss the maximum number of digons or touching points. Gr\\\"unbaum\nconjectured that there are at most $2n-2$ digon cells or equivalently at most\n$2n-2$ touchings. Agarwal et al. (2004) verified the conjecture for cylindrical\narrangements.

Moreover, we construct\nnon-cylindrical arrangements which attain the maximum of $2n-2$ touchings and\nhave no triple of pairwise touching pseudocircles.\nSecond, we discuss the minimum number of triangular cells (triangles) in\narrangements without digons and touchings. Felsner and Scheucher (2017) showed\nthat there exist arrangements with only $\\lceil \\frac{16}{11}n \\rceil$\ntriangles, which disproved a conjecture of Gr\\\"unbaum.

These complex policies call for flexible runtime health checks of\nsystem executions that go beyond conventional runtime monitoring of\npre-programmed health conditions, also in order to minimize maintenance costs.\nDefining a suitable monitoring model in the application of this method in\ncomplex systems is still a challenge.

    "abstract": "Trace theory is a framework for designing equivalence relations for\nconcurrent program runs based on a commutativity relation over the set of\natomic steps taken by individual program threads. It is simple and elegant, and\nit yields efficient algorithms that are broadly useful in many different\ncontexts. In this paper, we study relaxations of trace equivalence with the\ngoal of maintaining its algorithmic advantages. We first prove that the largest\nappropriate relaxation of trace equivalence, an equivalence relation that\npreserves the order of steps taken by each thread and what write operation each\nread operation observes, does not yield efficient algorithms. Specifically, we\nprove a linear space lower bound for the problem of checking if two arbitrary\nsteps of a concurrent program run are causally concurrent (i.e. they can be\nreordered in an equivalent run) or causally ordered. The same problem can be\ndecided in constant space for trace equivalence. Second, we propose a new\ncommutativity-based notion of equivalence that is strictly more relaxed than\ntrace equivalence, and yet yields a constant space algorithm for the same\nproblem. This notion of equivalence uses commutativity of certain blocks of\natomic steps in addition to the standard commutativity from trace theory. We\ndefine a new partial order and prove that it faithfully represents the new\nequivalence classes. The definition of the partial order relies on a novel\ntechnical contribution: a new notion of atomicity, called liberal atomicity\nthat is more relaxed than the well-known conflict-serializability. We\ndemonstrate that liberal atomicity can be checked as efficiently as\nconflict-serializability, i.e. in constant space, and use this efficient\nmonitor as part of our constant-space algorithm for deciding the status of\ncausal concurrency of two steps in a concurrent program run.",

    "abstract": "Hyperparameter optimization in machine learning is often achieved using naive\ntechniques that only lead to an approximate set of hyperparameters. Although\ntechniques such as Bayesian optimization perform an intelligent search on a\ngiven domain of hyperparameters, it does not guarantee an optimal solution. A\nmajor drawback of most of these approaches is an exponential increase of their\nsearch domain with number of hyperparameters, increasing the computational cost\nand making the approaches slow. The hyperparameter optimization problem is\ninherently a bilevel optimization task, and some studies have attempted bilevel\nsolution methodologies for solving this problem. However, these studies assume\na unique set of model weights that minimize the training loss, which is\ngenerally violated by deep learning architectures. This paper discusses a\ngradient-based bilevel method addressing these drawbacks for solving the\nhyperparameter optimization problem. The proposed method can handle continuous\nhyperparameters for which we have chosen the regularization hyperparameter in\nour experiments. The method guarantees convergence to the set of optimal\nhyperparameters that this study has theoretically proven. The idea is based on\napproximating the lower-level optimal value function using Gaussian process\nregression. As a result, the bilevel problem is reduced to a single level\nconstrained optimization task that is solved using the augmented Lagrangian\nmethod. We have performed an extensive computational study on the MNIST and\nCIFAR-10 datasets on multi-layer perceptron and LeNet architectures that\nconfirms the efficiency of the proposed method. A comparative study against\ngrid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and HyberBand method on\nvarious hyperparameter problems shows that the proposed algorithm converges\nwith lower computation and leads to models that generalize better on the\ntesting set.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of algorithms on time-varying networks (often called evolving\ngraphs) is a modern challenge in theoretical computer science. The\nedge-Markovian is a relatively simple and comprehensive model of evolving\ngraphs: every pair of vertices which is not a current edge independently\nbecomes an edge with probability $p$ at each time-step, as well as every edge\ndisappears with probability $q$. Clearly, the edge-Markovian graph changes its\nshape depending on the current shape, and the dependency refuses some useful\ntechniques for an independent sequence of random graphs which often behaves\nsimilarly to a static random graph. It motivates this paper to develop a new\ntechnique for analysis of algorithms on edge-Markovian evolving graphs.\nSpecifically speaking, this paper is concerned with load-balancing, which is\na popular subject in distributed computing, and we analyze the so-called random\nmatching algorithms, which is a standard scheme for load-balancing. We prove\nthat major random matching algorithms achieve nearly optimal load balance in\n$O(r \\log (\\Delta n))$ steps on edge-Markovian evolving graphs, where $r =\n\\max\\{p/(1-q), (1-q)/p\\}$, $n$ is the number of vertices (i.e., processors) and\n$\\Delta$ denotes the initial gap of loads unbalance. We remark that the\nindependent sequences of random graphs correspond to $r=1$. To avoid the\ndifficulty of an analysis caused by a complex correlation with the history of\nan execution, we develop a simple proof technique based on history-independent\nbounds. As far as we know, this is the first theoretical analysis of\nload-balancing on randomly evolving graphs, not only for the edge-Markovian but\nalso for the independent sequences of random graphs.",

    "abstract": "Software testing activities aim to find the possible defects of a software\nproduct and ensure that the product meets its expected requirements. Some\nsoftware testing approached are lacking automation or are partly automated\nwhich increases the testing time and overall software testing costs. Recently,\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has been successfully employed in complex testing\ntasks such as game testing, regression testing, and test case prioritization to\nautomate the process and provide continuous adaptation. Practitioners can\nemploy RL by implementing from scratch an RL algorithm or use an RL framework.\nDevelopers have widely used these frameworks to solve problems in various\ndomains including software testing. However, to the best of our knowledge,\nthere is no study that empirically evaluates the effectiveness and performance\nof pre-implemented algorithms in RL frameworks. In this paper, we empirically\ninvestigate the applications of carefully selected RL algorithms on two\nimportant software testing tasks: test case prioritization in the context of\nContinuous Integration (CI) and game testing. For the game testing task, we\nconduct experiments on a simple game and use RL algorithms to explore the game\nto detect bugs. Results show that some of the selected RL frameworks such as\nTensorforce outperform recent approaches in the literature. To prioritize test\ncases, we run experiments on a CI environment where RL algorithms from\ndifferent frameworks are used to rank the test cases. Our results show that the\nperformance difference between pre-implemented algorithms in some cases is\nconsiderable, motivating further investigation. Moreover, empirical evaluations\non some benchmark problems are recommended for researchers looking to select RL\nframeworks, to make sure that RL algorithms perform as intended.",

    "abstract": "The deepening penetration of renewable energy is challenging how power system\noperators cope with the associated variability and uncertainty in the unit\ncommitment problem. Given its computational complexity, several\noptimization-based methods have been proposed to lighten the full unit\ncommitment formulation by removing redundant line flow constraints. These\napproaches often ignore the spatial couplings of multi-side renewable\ngeneration and demand. To address this pitfall, we rule out redundant\nconstraints over a tightened linear programming relaxation of the original unit\ncommitment feasibility region by adding a constraint that efficiently models\nthe correlation of residual demand variations. We set forth a novel, tractable\nand robust polyhedral uncertainty envelope induced by a given set of scenarios\nto characterize the tightening constraint. We propose a data-driven umbrella\nconstraint discovery problem formulation that substantially increase the\nnetwork constraints filtration in unit commitment.

Even though previous research has compared specific formatting\nelements to find out which alternatives affect code legibility, seeing the\nbigger picture of what makes code more or less legible is challenging. Goal: We\naim to find which formatting elements have been investigated in empirical\nstudies and which ones were found to be more legible for human subjects.\nMethod: We conduct a systematic literature review and identify 12 papers that\ncompare alternative formatting elements. We organize these formatting elements\nusing a card sorting method. Results: We identify 29 formatting elements, which\nare about formatting styles, spacing, block delimiters, long or complex code\nlines, and word boundary styles. While some formatting elements were found to\nbe statistically better than other equivalent ones, e.g., camel case over\nunderscore, others were not, e.g., pretty-printed vs. disrupted layout. For\nsome alternatives, divergent results were found, e.g., one study found a\nsignificant difference in favor of 2-space indentation, but two other studies\ndid not find it. Conclusion: Our results can serve as guidelines for developers\nin choosing ways to format their code and help researchers in developing, e.g.,\nrecommendation systems, to aid developers to make their code more legible.",

    "abstract": "Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) distance is a family of metrics to gauge the\ndiscrepancy of two Radon measures, which takes into account both transportation\nand weight change. Spherical WFR distance is a projected version of WFR\ndistance for probability measures so that the space of Radon measures equipped\nwith WFR can be viewed as metric cone over the space of probability measures\nwith spherical WFR. Compared to the case for Wasserstein distance, the\nunderstanding of geodesics under the spherical WFR is less clear and still an\nongoing research focus. In this paper, we develop a deep learning framework to\ncompute the geodesics under the spherical WFR metric, and the learned geodesics\ncan be adopted to generate weighted samples. Our approach is based on a\nBenamou-Brenier type dynamic formulation for spherical WFR. To overcome the\ndifficulty in enforcing the boundary constraint brought by the weight change, a\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term based on the inverse map is introduced\ninto the cost function. Moreover, a new regularization term using the particle\nvelocity is introduced as a substitute for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the\npotential in dynamic formula.

These AS-OCT images are often acquired by different imaging\ndevices/conditions, which results in a vast change of underlying data\ndistributions (called \"data domains\"). Moreover, due to practical labeling\ndifficulties, some domains (e.g., devices) may not have any data labels. As a\nresult, deep models trained on one specific domain (e.g., a specific device)\nare difficult to adapt to and thus may perform poorly on other domains (e.g.,\nother devices). To address this issue, we present a multi-target domain\nadaptation paradigm to transfer a model trained on one labeled source domain to\nmultiple unlabeled target domains. Specifically, we propose a novel Multi-scale\nMulti-target Domain Adversarial Network (M2DAN) for angle closure\nclassification. M2DAN conducts multi-domain adversarial learning for extracting\ndomain-invariant features and develops a multi-scale module for capturing local\nand global information of AS-OCT images. Based on these domain-invariant\nfeatures at different scales, the deep model trained on the source domain is\nable to classify angle closure on multiple target domains even without any\nannotations in these domains.

The prevailing adaptive VDC approach requires tuning of\n13n adaptation gains along with 26n upper and lower parameter bounds, where n\nis the number of rigid bodies. Therefore, utilizing the VDC scheme to control\nhigh DoF robots like the 7-DoF upper-limb exoskeleton can be an arduous task.\nIn this paper, a new adaptation function, so-called natural adaptation law\n(NAL), is employed to eliminate these burdens from VDC, which results in\nreducing all 13n gains to one and removing dependency on upper and lower\nbounds. In doing so, VDC-based dynamic equations are restructured, and inertial\nparameter vectors are made compatible with NAL. Then, the NAL adaptation\nfunction is exploited to design a new adaptive VDC scheme. This novel adaptive\nVDC approach ensures physical consistency conditions for estimated parameters\nwith no need for upper and lower bounds. Finally, the asymptotic stability of\nthe algorithm is proved with the virtual stability concept and the accompanying\nfunction.

In\nthese applications, the target function may represent a desired quantity of\ninterest of a parameterized Partial Differential Equation (PDE). Due to the\nlarge cost of solving such problems, where each sample is computed by solving a\nPDE, sample efficiency is a key concerning these applications. Recently, there\nhas been increasing focus on the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Deep\nLearning (DL) for learning such functions from data. In this work, we propose\nan adaptive sampling strategy, CAS4DL (Christoffel Adaptive Sampling for Deep\nLearning) to increase the sample efficiency of DL for multivariate function\napproximation. Our novel approach is based on interpreting the second to last\nlayer of a DNN as a dictionary of functions defined by the nodes on that layer.\nWith this viewpoint, we then define an adaptive sampling strategy motivated by\nadaptive sampling schemes recently proposed for linear approximation schemes,\nwherein samples are drawn randomly with respect to the Christoffel function of\nthe subspace spanned by this dictionary. We present numerical experiments\ncomparing CAS4DL with standard Monte Carlo (MC) sampling.

    "title": "Turning Mathematics Problems into Games: Reinforcement Learning and  Gr\u00f6bner bases together solve Integer Feasibility Problems",
    "abstract": "Can agents be trained to answer difficult mathematical questions by playing a\ngame? We consider the integer feasibility problem, a challenge of deciding\nwhether a system of linear equations and inequalities has a solution with\ninteger values. This is a famous NP-complete problem with applications in many\nareas of Mathematics and Computer Science. Our paper describes a novel\nalgebraic reinforcement learning framework that allows an agent to play a game\nequivalent to the integer feasibility problem. We explain how to transform the\ninteger feasibility problem into a game over a set of arrays with fixed margin\nsums. The game starts with an initial state (an array), and by applying a legal\nmove that leaves the margins unchanged, we aim to eventually reach a winning\nstate with zeros in specific positions. To win the game the player must find a\npath between the initial state and a final terminal winning state if one\nexists. Finding such a winning state is equivalent to solving the integer\nfeasibility problem. The key algebraic ingredient is a Gr\\\"obner basis of the\ntoric ideal for the underlying axial transportation polyhedron. The Gr\\\"obner\nbasis can be seen as a set of connecting moves (actions) of the game. We then\npropose a novel RL approach that trains an agent to predict moves in continuous\nspace to cope with the large size of action space. The continuous move is then\nprojected onto the set of legal moves so that the path always leads to valid\nstates. As a proof of concept we demonstrate in experiments that our agent can\nplay well the simplest version of our game for 2-way tables. Our work\nhighlights the potential to train agents to solve non-trivial mathematical\nqueries through contemporary machine learning methods used to train agents to\nplay games.",

The AMA safety code regulates how\nAMA flyers operate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for limited recreational\npurposes.

In this paper,\nwe leverage Answer Set Programming to encode the AMA safety code and automate\ncompliance checks. To check compliance, we use the s(CASP) which is a\ngoal-directed ASP engine. By using s(CASP) the operators can easily check for\nviolations and obtain a justification tree explaining the cause of the\nviolations in human-readable natural language. Further, we implement an\nalgorithm to help the operators obtain the minimal set of conditions that need\nto be satisfied in order to pass the compliance check. We develop a front-end\nquestionnaire interface that accepts various conditions and use the backend\ns(CASP) engine to evaluate whether the conditions adhere to the regulations.

In\nthis work, we explore cross-modal learning in an attempt to bridge audio and\nlanguage in the music domain.

Our experiments show that our method performs\nsignificantly better than the baselines at retrieving audio that matches a\ntextual description and, conversely, text that matches an audio query.

An expressive class of graphical models,\n\\textit{relational causal models}, can represent and reason about complex\ndynamic systems exhibiting such cycles or feedback loops. Existing cyclic\ncausal discovery algorithms for learning causal models from observational data\nassume that the data instances are independent and identically distributed\nwhich makes them unsuitable for relational causal models.

In\nthis work, we examine the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a\nconstraint-based relational causal discovery algorithm is sound and complete\nfor \\textit{cyclic relational causal models}. We introduce \\textit{relational\nacyclification}, an operation specifically designed for relational models that\nenables reasoning about the identifiability of cyclic relational causal models.\nWe show that under the assumptions of relational acyclification and\n$\\sigma$-faithfulness, the relational causal discovery algorithm RCD (Maier et\nal. 2013) is sound and complete for cyclic models.

However, these approaches fail to\nremain fair with changes in the task or demographic distribution. To ensure\nfairness in the wild, it is important for a system to adapt to such changes as\nit accesses new data in an incremental fashion.

To this end, we present Fairness-aware\nIncremental Representation Learning (FaIRL), a representation learning system\nthat can sustain fairness while incrementally learning new tasks.

ORide is one of the early RHS proposals published at\nUSENIX Security Symposium 2017. In the ORide protocol, riders and drivers,\noperating in a zone, encrypt their locations using a Somewhat Homomorphic\nEncryption scheme (SHE) and forward them to the Service Provider (SP). SP\nhomomorphically computes the squared Euclidean distance between riders and\navailable drivers. Rider receives the encrypted distances and selects the\noptimal rider after decryption. In order to prevent a triangulation attack, SP\nrandomly permutes the distances before sending them to the rider. In this work,\nwe use propose a passive attack that uses triangulation to determine\ncoordinates of all participating drivers whose permuted distances are available\nfrom the points of view of multiple honest-but-curious adversary riders. An\nattack on ORide was published at SAC 2021. The same paper proposes a\ncountermeasure using noisy Euclidean distances to thwart their attack. We\nextend our attack to determine locations of drivers when given their permuted\nand noisy Euclidean distances from multiple points of reference, where the\nnoise perturbation comes from a uniform distribution. We conduct experiments\nwith different number of drivers and for different perturbation values.

    "abstract": "Multi-objective optimization problems whose objectives have different\nevaluation costs are commonly seen in the real world. Such problems are now\nknown as multi-objective optimization problems with heterogeneous objectives\n(HE-MOPs). So far, however, only a few studies have been reported to address\nHE-MOPs, and most of them focus on bi-objective problems with one fast\nobjective and one slow objective. In this work, we aim to deal with HE-MOPs\nhaving more than two black-box and heterogeneous objectives. To this end, we\ndevelop a multi-objective Bayesian evolutionary optimization approach to\nHE-MOPs by exploiting the different data sets on the cheap and expensive\nobjectives in HE-MOPs to alleviate the search bias caused by the heterogeneous\nevaluation costs for evaluating different objectives. To make the best use of\ntwo different training data sets, one with solutions evaluated on all\nobjectives and the other with those only evaluated on the fast objectives, two\nseparate Gaussian process models are constructed. In addition, a new\nacquisition function that mitigates search bias towards the fast objectives is\nsuggested, thereby achieving a balance between convergence and diversity.

    "abstract": "Business Process Simulation (BPS) is a common technique to estimate the\nimpact of business process changes, e.g. what would be the cycle time of a\nprocess if the number of traces increases? The starting point of BPS is a\nbusiness process model annotated with simulation parameters (a BPS model).\nSeveral studies have proposed methods to automatically discover BPS models from\nevent logs -- extracted from enterprise information systems -- via process\nmining techniques. These approaches model the processing time of each activity\nbased on the start and end timestamps recorded in the event log. In practice,\nhowever, it is common that the recorded start times do not precisely reflect\nthe actual start of the activities. For example, a resource starts working on\nan activity, but its start time is not recorded until she/he interacts with the\nsystem. If not corrected, these situations induce waiting times in which the\nresource is considered to be free, while she/he is actually working. To address\nthis limitation, this article proposes a technique to identify the waiting time\nprevious to each activity instance in which the resource is actually working on\nthem, and repair their start time so that they reflect the actual processing\ntime. The idea of the proposed technique is that, as far as simulation is\nconcerned, an activity instance may start once it is enabled and the\ncorresponding resource is available. Accordingly, for each activity instance,\nthe proposed technique estimates the activity enablement and the resource\navailability time based on the information available in the event log, and\nrepairs the start time to include the non-recorded processing time. An\nempirical evaluation involving eight real-life event logs shows that the\nproposed approach leads to BPS models that closely reflect the temporal\ndynamics of the process.",

    "title": "Towards A Complete Multi-Agent Pathfinding Algorithm For Large Agents",
    "abstract": "Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a challenging problem which is hard to\nsolve optimally even when simplifying assumptions are adopted, e.g. planar\ngraphs (typically -- grids), discretized time, uniform duration of move and\nwait actions etc. On the other hand, MAPF under such restrictive assumptions\n(also known as the Classical MAPF) is equivalent to the so-called pebble motion\nproblem for which non-optimal polynomial time algorithms do exist. Recently, a\nbody of works emerged that investigated MAPF beyond the basic setting and, in\nparticular, considered agents of arbitrary size and shape. Still, to the best\nof our knowledge no complete algorithms for such MAPF variant exists. In this\nwork we attempt to narrow this gap by considering MAPF for large agents and\nsuggesting how this problem can be reduced to pebble motion on (general)\ngraphs. The crux of this reduction is the procedure that moves away the agents\naway from the edge which is needed to perform a move action of the current\nagent. We consider different variants of how this procedure can be implemented\nand present a variant of the pebble motion algorithm which incorporates this\nprocedure. Unfortunately, the algorithm is still incomplete, but empirically we\nshow that it is able to solve much more MAPF instances (under the strict time\nlimit) with large agents on arbitrary non-planar graphs (roadmaps) compared to\nthe state-of-the-art MAPF solver -- Continous Conflict-Based Search (CCBS).",

    "abstract": "Affect modeling is viewed, traditionally, as the process of mapping\nmeasurable affect manifestations from multiple modalities of user input to\naffect labels. That mapping is usually inferred through end-to-end\n(manifestation-to-affect) machine learning processes. What if, instead, one\ntrains general, subject-invariant representations that consider affect\ninformation and then uses such representations to model affect? In this paper\nwe assume that affect labels form an integral part, and not just the training\nsignal, of an affect representation and we explore how the recent paradigm of\ncontrastive learning can be employed to discover general high-level\naffect-infused representations for the purpose of modeling affect. We introduce\nthree different supervised contrastive learning approaches for training\nrepresentations that consider affect information. In this initial study we test\nthe proposed methods for arousal prediction in the RECOLA dataset based on user\ninformation from multiple modalities. Results demonstrate the representation\ncapacity of contrastive learning and its efficiency in boosting the accuracy of\naffect models. Beyond their evidenced higher performance compared to end-to-end\narousal classification, the resulting representations are general-purpose and\nsubject-agnostic, as training is guided though general affect information\navailable in any multimodal corpus.",

    "abstract": "Large text-to-image models achieved a remarkable leap in the evolution of AI,\nenabling high-quality and diverse synthesis of images from a given text prompt.\nHowever, these models lack the ability to mimic the appearance of subjects in a\ngiven reference set and synthesize novel renditions of them in different\ncontexts. In this work, we present a new approach for \"personalization\" of\ntext-to-image diffusion models (specializing them to users' needs). Given as\ninput just a few images of a subject, we fine-tune a pretrained text-to-image\nmodel (Imagen, although our method is not limited to a specific model) such\nthat it learns to bind a unique identifier with that specific subject. Once the\nsubject is embedded in the output domain of the model, the unique identifier\ncan then be used to synthesize fully-novel photorealistic images of the subject\ncontextualized in different scenes. By leveraging the semantic prior embedded\nin the model with a new autogenous class-specific prior preservation loss, our\ntechnique enables synthesizing the subject in diverse scenes, poses, views, and\nlighting conditions that do not appear in the reference images. We apply our\ntechnique to several previously-unassailable tasks, including subject\nrecontextualization, text-guided view synthesis, appearance modification, and\nartistic rendering (all while preserving the subject's key features).

    "abstract": "We propose a hybrid machine learning architecture that simultaneously employs\nmultiple deep learning models analyzing contextual and behavioral\ncharacteristics of Windows portable executable, producing a final prediction\nbased on a decision from the meta-model. The detection heuristic in\ncontemporary machine learning Windows malware classifiers is typically based on\nthe static properties of the sample since dynamic analysis through\nvirtualization is challenging for vast quantities of samples. To surpass this\nlimitation, we employ a Windows kernel emulation that allows the acquisition of\nbehavioral patterns across large corpora with minimal temporal and\ncomputational costs. We partner with a security vendor for a collection of more\nthan 100k int-the-wild samples that resemble the contemporary threat landscape,\ncontaining raw PE files and filepaths of applications at the moment of\nexecution. The acquired dataset is at least ten folds larger than reported in\nrelated works on behavioral malware analysis. Files in the training dataset are\nlabeled by a professional threat intelligence team, utilizing manual and\nautomated reverse engineering tools. We estimate the hybrid classifier's\noperational utility by collecting an out-of-sample test set three months later\nfrom the acquisition of the training set. We report an improved detection rate,\nabove the capabilities of the current state-of-the-art model, especially under\nlow false-positive requirements. Additionally, we uncover a meta-model's\nability to identify malicious activity in validation and test sets even if none\nof the individual models express enough confidence to mark the sample as\nmalevolent. We conclude that the meta-model can learn patterns typical to\nmalicious samples from representation combinations produced by different\nanalysis techniques.

This paper\npresents Grasp'D, an approach for grasp synthesis with a differentiable contact\nsimulation from both known models as well as visual inputs. We use\ngradient-based methods as an alternative to sampling-based grasp synthesis,\nwhich fails without simplifying assumptions, such as pre-specified contact\nlocations and eigengrasps. Such assumptions limit grasp discovery and, in\nparticular, exclude high-contact power grasps.

We identify and address challenges in making grasp simulation\namenable to gradient-based optimization, such as non-smooth object surface\ngeometry, contact sparsity, and a rugged optimization landscape. Grasp-D\ncompares favorably to analytic grasp synthesis on human and robotic hand\nmodels, and resultant grasps achieve over 4x denser contact, leading to\nsignificantly higher grasp stability.

    "abstract": "The Global Positioning System (GPS) has become a part of our daily life with\nthe primary goal of providing geopositioning service. For an unmanned aerial\nsystem (UAS), geolocalization ability is an extremely important necessity which\nis achieved using Inertial Navigation System (INS) with the GPS at its heart.\nWithout geopositioning service, UAS is unable to fly to its destination or come\nback home. Unfortunately, GPS signals can be jammed and suffer from a multipath\nproblem in urban canyons. Our goal is to propose an alternative approach to\ngeolocalize a UAS when GPS signal is degraded or denied. Considering UAS has a\ndownward-looking camera on its platform that can acquire real-time images as\nthe platform flies, we apply modern deep learning techniques to achieve\ngeolocalization. In particular, we perform image matching to establish latent\nfeature conjugates between UAS acquired imagery and satellite orthophotos. A\ntypical application of feature matching suffers from high-rise buildings and\nnew constructions in the field that introduce uncertainties into homography\nestimation, hence results in poor geolocalization performance. Instead, we\nextract GIS information from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to semantically segment\nmatched features into building and terrain classes. The GIS mask works as a\nfilter in selecting semantically matched features that enhance coplanarity\nconditions and the UAS geolocalization accuracy.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the potential of distilling knowledge from pre-trained\nmodels, especially Masked Autoencoders. Our approach is simple: in addition to\noptimizing the pixel reconstruction loss on masked inputs, we minimize the\ndistance between the intermediate feature map of the teacher model and that of\nthe student model. This design leads to a computationally efficient knowledge\ndistillation framework, given 1) only a small visible subset of patches is\nused, and 2) the (cumbersome) teacher model only needs to be partially\nexecuted, \\ie, forward propagate inputs through the first few layers, for\nobtaining intermediate feature maps. Compared to directly distilling fine-tuned\nmodels, distilling pre-trained models substantially improves downstream\nperformance. For example, by distilling the knowledge from an MAE pre-trained\nViT-L into a ViT-B, our method achieves 84.0% ImageNet top-1 accuracy,\noutperforming the baseline of directly distilling a fine-tuned ViT-L by 1.2%.\nMore intriguingly, our method can robustly distill knowledge from teacher\nmodels even with extremely high masking ratios: e.g., with 95% masking ratio\nwhere merely TEN patches are visible during distillation, our ViT-B\ncompetitively attains a top-1 ImageNet accuracy of 83.6%; surprisingly, it can\nstill secure 82.4% top-1 ImageNet accuracy by aggressively training with just\nFOUR visible patches (98% masking ratio).

Benefiting from the self-attention mechanism, these\nmodels show stronger ability of modeling long-range dependencies compared to\nCNN-based models. However, significant computation overheads, resulted from the\nquadratic complexity of self-attention on top of a tremendous number of tokens,\nlimit the use of existing video transformers in applications with limited\nresources like mobile devices. In this paper, we extend Mobile-Former to Video\nMobile-Former, which decouples the video architecture into a lightweight\n3D-CNNs for local context modeling and a Transformer modules for global\ninteraction modeling in a parallel fashion. To avoid significant computational\ncost incurred by computing self-attention between the large number of local\npatches in videos, we propose to use very few global tokens (e.g., 6) for a\nwhole video in Transformers to exchange information with 3D-CNNs with a\ncross-attention mechanism. Through efficient global spatial-temporal modeling,\nVideo Mobile-Former significantly improves the video recognition performance of\nalternative lightweight baselines, and outperforms other efficient CNN-based\nmodels at the low FLOP regime from 500M to 6G total FLOPs on various video\nrecognition tasks.

    "abstract": "For software interacting directly with real-world end-users, it is common\npractice to script scenario tests validating the system's compliance with a\nnumber of its features. However, these do not accommodate the replication of\nthe type of end-user activity to which the system is required to respond in a\nlive instance. It is especially true as compliance might also break in\nscenarios of interactions with external events or processes, such as other\nusers. State-of-the-art approaches aim at inducing the software into runtime\nerrors by generating tests that maximize some target metrics, such as code\ncoverage. As a result, they suffer from targeting an infinitely large search\nspace, are severely limited in recognizing error states that do not result in\nruntime errors, and the test cases they generate are often challenging to\ninterpret. Other forms of testing, such as Record-Replay, instead fail to\ncapture the end-users' decision-making process, hence producing largely\nscripted test scenarios. Therefore, it is impossible to test a software's\ncompliance with unknown but otherwise plausible states. This paper introduces\n\"Synthetic End-User Testing,\" a novel testing strategy for complex systems in\nwhich real-world users are synthesized into reusable agents and employed to\ntest and validate the software in a simulation environment. Hence, it discusses\nhow end-user behavioral examples can be obtained and used to create agents that\noperate the target software in a reduced search space of likely action\nsequences. The notion of action expectation, which allows agents to assert the\nlearned compliance of the system, is also introduced. Finally, a prototype\nasserting the feasibility of such a strategy is presented.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by problems where jumps across lower dimensional subsets and sharp\ntransitions across interfaces are of interest, this paper studies the\nproperties of fractional bounded variation ($BV$)-type spaces.\nTwo different natural fractional analogs of classical $BV$ are considered:\n$BV^\\alpha$, a space induced from the Riesz-fractional gradient that has been\nrecently studied by Comi-Stefani; and $bv^\\alpha$, induced by the\nGagliardo-type fractional gradient often used in Dirichlet forms and\nPeridynamics - this one is naturally related to the\nCaffarelli-Roquejoffre-Savin fractional perimeter. Our main theoretical result\nis that the latter $bv^\\alpha$ actually corresponds to the\nGagliardo-Slobodeckij space $W^{\\alpha,1}$. As an application, using the\nproperties of these spaces, novel image denoising models are introduced and\ntheir corresponding Fenchel pre-dual formulations are derived. The latter\nrequires density of smooth functions with compact support. We establish this\ndensity property for convex domains.",

Quantifying the uncertainty of such a decomposition based on\na finite sample estimate is essential to reasoning under uncertainty when\nemploying such models. This paper tackles the challenge of computing confidence\nbounds on the individual entries of eigenvectors of a covariance matrix of\nfixed dimension. Moreover, we derive a method to bound the entries of the\ninverse covariance matrix, the so-called precision matrix. The assumptions\nbehind our method are minimal and require that the covariance matrix exists,\nand its empirical estimator converges to the true covariance. We make use of\nthe theory of U-statistics to bound the $L_2$ perturbation of the empirical\ncovariance matrix. From this result, we obtain bounds on the eigenvectors using\nWeyl's theorem and the eigenvalue-eigenvector identity and we derive confidence\nintervals on the entries of the precision matrix using matrix inversion\nperturbation bounds. As an application of these results, we demonstrate a new\nstatistical test, which allows us to test for non-zero values of the precision\nmatrix.

    "title": "Control Barrier Functions-based Semi-Definite Programs (CBF-SDPs):  Robust Safe Control For Dynamic Systems with Relative Degree Two Safety  Indices",
    "abstract": "In this draft article, we consider the problem of achieving safe control of a\ndynamic system for which the safety index or (control barrier function\n(loosely)) has relative degree equal to two. We consider parameter affine\nnonlinear dynamic systems and assume that the parametric uncertainty is uniform\nand known a-priori or being updated online through an estimator/parameter\nadaptation law. Under this uncertainty, the usual CBF-QP safe control approach\ntakes the form of a robust optimization problem. Both the right hand side and\nleft hand side of the inequality constraints depend on the unknown parameter.\nWith the given representation of uncertainty, the CBF-QP safe control ends up\nbeing a convex semi-infinite problem. Using two different philosophies, one\nbased on weak duality and another based on the Lossless s-procedure, we arrive\nat identical SDP formulations of this robust CBF-QP problem. Thus we show that\nthe problem of computing safe controls with known parametric uncertainty can be\nposed as a tractable convex problem and be solved online. (This is work in\nprogress).",
