    "abstract": "Existing literature on digital signage is growing but has not always\nemphasized the cognitive processes of the audience. This research aims to\naddress this gap by studying how young women in Singapore cognize commercial\ndigital signage in shopping malls and what cause them to do so. Using cognitive\nethnography and taking the situated action approach, our findings suggest a\ncomprehensive list of factors, both external and internal, that influence young\nwomen's cognition of commercial digital signage in both positive and negative\nways. The research's practical implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been shown to be susceptible to Trojan\nattacks. Neural Trojan is a type of targeted poisoning attack that embeds the\nbackdoor into the victim and is activated by the trigger in the input space.\nThe increasing deployment of DNNs in critical systems and the surge of\noutsourcing DNN training (which makes Trojan attack easier) makes the detection\nof Trojan attacks necessary. While Neural Trojan detection has been studied in\nthe image domain, there is a lack of solutions in the NLP domain. In this\npaper, we propose a model-level Trojan detection framework by analyzing the\ndeviation of the model output when we introduce a specially crafted\nperturbation to the input. Particularly, we extract the model's responses to\nperturbed inputs as the `signature' of the model and train a meta-classifier to\ndetermine if a model is Trojaned based on its signature. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method on both a dataset of NLP models we create\nand a public dataset of Trojaned NLP models from TrojAI. Furthermore, we\npropose a lightweight variant of our detection method that reduces the\ndetection time while preserving the detection rates.",

We develop an annotated dataset that includes\ndiverse reaches performed while in a sitting posture by different infants in\nunconstrained environments (e.g., in home settings, etc.).

Optics is a promising contender for\nproviding lower power computation since light propagation through a\nnon-absorbing medium is a lossless operation. However, to carry out useful and\nefficient computations with light, generating and controlling nonlinearity\noptically is a necessity that is still elusive. Multimode fibers (MMF) have\nbeen shown that they can provide nonlinear effects with microwatts of average\npower while maintaining parallelism and low loss.

    "abstract": "The human brain is capable of learning tasks sequentially mostly without\nforgetting. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting when learning one task after another. We address this challenge\nconsidering a class-incremental learning scenario where the DNN sees test data\nwithout knowing the task from which this data originates. During training,\nContinual-Prune-and-Select (CP&S) finds a subnetwork within the DNN that is\nresponsible for solving a given task. Then, during inference, CP&S selects the\ncorrect subnetwork to make predictions for that task. A new task is learned by\ntraining available neuronal connections of the DNN (previously untrained) to\ncreate a new subnetwork by pruning, which can include previously trained\nconnections belonging to other subnetwork(s) because it does not update shared\nconnections. This enables to eliminate catastrophic forgetting by creating\nspecialized regions in the DNN that do not conflict with each other while still\nallowing knowledge transfer across them. The CP&S strategy is implemented with\ndifferent subnetwork selection strategies, revealing superior performance to\nstate-of-the-art continual learning methods tested on various datasets\n(CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1000).

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this\nrepresents an improvement in accuracy above 20% when compared to the best\nalternative method.",

    "abstract": "Real time accurate solutions of large scale complex dynamical systems are in\ncritical need for control, optimization, uncertainty quantification, and\ndecision-making in practical engineering and science applications. This paper\ncontributes in this direction a model constrained tangent manifold learning\n(mcTangent) approach. At the heart of mcTangent is the synergy of several\ndesirable strategies: i) a tangent manifold learning to take advantage of the\nneural network speed and the time accurate nature of the method of lines; ii) a\nmodel constrained approach to encode the neural network tangent with the\nunderlying governing equations; iii) sequential learning strategies to promote\nlong time stability and accuracy; and iv) data randomization approach to\nimplicitly enforce the smoothness of the neural network tangent and its\nlikeliness to the truth tangent up second order derivatives in order to further\nenhance the stability and accuracy of mcTangent solutions. Both semi heuristic\nand rigorous arguments are provided to analyze and justify the proposed\napproach. Several numerical results for transport equation, viscous Burgers\nequation, and Navier Stokes equation are presented to study and demonstrate the\ncapability of the proposed mcTangent learning approach.",

    "abstract": "Unencrypted DNS traffic between users and DNS resolvers can lead to privacy\nand security concerns. In response to these privacy risks, many browser vendors\nhave deployed DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) to encrypt queries between users and DNS\nresolvers. Today, many client-side deployments of DoH, particularly in\nbrowsers, select between only a few resolvers, despite the fact that many more\nencrypted DNS resolvers are deployed in practice. Unfortunately, if users only\nhave a few choices of encrypted resolver, and only a few perform well from any\nparticular vantage point, then the privacy problems that DoH was deployed to\nhelp address merely shift to a different set of third parties. It is thus\nimportant to assess the performance characteristics of more encrypted DNS\nresolvers, to determine how many options for encrypted DNS resolvers users tend\nto have in practice. In this paper, we explore the performance of a large group\nof encrypted DNS resolvers supporting DoH by measuring DNS query response times\nfrom global vantage points in North America, Europe, and Asia. Our results show\nthat many non-mainstream resolvers have higher response times than mainstream\nresolvers, particularly for non-mainstream resolvers that are queried from more\ndistant vantage points -- suggesting that most encrypted DNS resolvers are not\nreplicated or anycast. In some cases, however, certain non-mainstream resolvers\nperform at least as well as mainstream resolvers, suggesting that users may be\nable to use a broader set of encrypted DNS resolvers than those that are\navailable in current browser configurations.",

An approach is proposed to assist systems\nengineers in the automatic generation of systems diagrams from unstructured\nnatural language text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used to\nextract entities and their relationships from textual resources (e.g.,\nspecifications, manuals, technical reports, maintenance reports) available\nwithin an organisation, and convert them into Systems Modelling Language\n(SysML) diagrams, with particular focus on structure and requirement diagrams.\nThe intention is to provide the users with a more standardised, comprehensive\nand automated starting point onto which subsequently refine and adapt the\ndiagrams according to their needs. The proposed approach is flexible and\nopen-domain. It consists of six steps which leverage open-access tools, and it\nleads to an automatic generation of SysML diagrams without intermediate\nmodelling requirement, but through the specification of a set of parameters by\nthe user.

User\nre-identification and other sensitive inferences are major privacy threats when\ngeolocated data are shared with cloud-assisted applications. Significantly,\nfour spatio-temporal points are enough to uniquely identify 95\\% of the\nindividuals, which exacerbates personal information leakages. To tackle\nmalicious purposes such as user re-identification, we propose an LSTM-based\nadversarial mechanism with representation learning to attain a\nprivacy-preserving feature representation of the original geolocated data\n(i.e., mobility data) for a sharing purpose. These representations aim to\nmaximally reduce the chance of user re-identification and full data\nreconstruction with a minimal utility budget (i.e., loss). We train the\nmechanism by quantifying privacy-utility trade-off of mobility datasets in\nterms of trajectory reconstruction risk, user re-identification risk, and\nmobility predictability. We report an exploratory analysis that enables the\nuser to assess this trade-off with a specific loss function and its weight\nparameters. The extensive comparison results on four representative mobility\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed architecture in mobility\nprivacy protection and the efficiency of the proposed privacy-preserving\nfeatures extractor.

However, most work in DVL for\nchildren relies on a more formal educational context (i.e., a teacher-led\napproach) that limits children's engagement with data to classroom-based\nenvironments and, consequently, children's ability to ask questions about and\nexplore data on topics they find personally meaningful. We explore how a\ncuriosity-driven, child-led approach can provide more agency to children when\nthey are authoring data visualizations. This paper explores how informal\nlearning with crafting physicalizations through play and curiosity may foster\nincreased literacy and engagement with data. Employing a constructionist\napproach, we designed a do-it-yourself toolkit made out of everyday materials\n(e.g., paper, cardboard, mirrors) that enables children to create, customize,\nand personalize three different interactive visualizations (bar, line, pie). We\nused the toolkit as a design probe in a series of in-person workshops with 5\nchildren (6 to 11-year-olds) and interviews with 5 educators. Our observations\nreveal that the toolkit helped children creatively engage and interact with\nvisualizations. Children with prior knowledge of data visualization reported\nthe toolkit serving as more of an authoring tool that they envision using in\ntheir daily lives, while children with little to no experience found the\ntoolkit as an engaging introduction to data visualization. Our study\ndemonstrates the potential of using the constructionist approach to cultivate\nchildren's DVL through curiosity and play.",

    "abstract": "Vision-based human activity recognition has emerged as one of the essential\nresearch areas in video analytics domain. Over the last decade, numerous\nadvanced deep learning algorithms have been introduced to recognize complex\nhuman actions from video streams. These deep learning algorithms have shown\nimpressive performance for the human activity recognition task. However, these\nnewly introduced methods either exclusively focus on model performance or the\neffectiveness of these models in terms of computational efficiency and\nrobustness, resulting in a biased tradeoff in their proposals to deal with\nchallenging human activity recognition problem. To overcome the limitations of\ncontemporary deep learning models for human activity recognition, this paper\npresents a computationally efficient yet generic spatial-temporal cascaded\nframework that exploits the deep discriminative spatial and temporal features\nfor human activity recognition. For efficient representation of human actions,\nwe have proposed an efficient dual attentional convolutional neural network\n(CNN) architecture that leverages a unified channel-spatial attention mechanism\nto extract human-centric salient features in video frames. The dual\nchannel-spatial attention layers together with the convolutional layers learn\nto be more attentive in the spatial receptive fields having objects over the\nnumber of feature maps. The extracted discriminative salient features are then\nforwarded to stacked bi-directional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) for long-term\ntemporal modeling and recognition of human actions using both forward and\nbackward pass gradient learning.

Edge\ncomponents, such as vehicles in next-generation intelligent transport systems,\nuse well-trained semantic models to encode and decode semantic information\nextracted from raw and sensor data. However, the limitation in computing\nresources makes it difficult to support the training process of accurate\nsemantic models on edge devices. As such, edge devices can buy the pretrained\nsemantic models from semantic model providers, which is called \"semantic model\ntrading\". Upon collecting semantic information with the semantic models, the\nedge devices can then sell the extracted semantic information, e.g.,\ninformation about urban road conditions or traffic signs, to the interested\nbuyers for profit, which is called \"semantic information trading\". To\nfacilitate both types of the trades, effective incentive mechanisms should be\ndesigned. Thus, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical trading system to\nsupport both semantic model trading and semantic information trading jointly.\nThe proposed incentive mechanism helps to maximize the revenue of semantic\nmodel providers in the semantic model trading, and effectively incentivizes\nmodel providers to participate in the development of semantic communication\nsystems.

    "title": "Model-Free Generative Replay for Lifelong Reinforcement Learning:  Application to Starcraft-2",
    "abstract": "One approach to meet the challenges of deep lifelong reinforcement learning\n(LRL) is careful management of the agent's learning experiences, in order to\nlearn (without forgetting) and build internal meta-models (of the tasks,\nenvironments, agents, and world). Generative replay (GR) is a\nbiologically-inspired replay mechanism that augments learning experiences with\nself-labelled examples drawn from an internal generative model that is updated\nover time. In this paper, we present a version of GR for LRL that satisfies two\ndesiderata: (a) Introspective density modelling of the latent representations\nof policies learned using deep RL, and (b) Model-free end-to-end learning. In\nthis work, we study three deep learning architectures for model-free GR. We\nevaluate our proposed algorithms on three different scenarios comprising tasks\nfrom the StarCraft2 and Minigrid domains. We report several key findings\nshowing the impact of the design choices on quantitative metrics that include\ntransfer learning, generalization to unseen tasks, fast adaptation after task\nchange, performance comparable to a task expert, and minimizing catastrophic\nforgetting. We observe that our GR prevents drift in the features-to-action\nmapping from the latent vector space of a deep actor-critic agent. We also show\nimprovements in established lifelong learning metrics. We find that the\nintroduction of a small random replay buffer is needed to significantly\nincrease the stability of training, when used in conjunction with the replay\nbuffer and the generated replay buffer. Overall, we find that \"hidden replay\"\n(a well-known architecture for class-incremental classification) is the most\npromising approach that pushes the state-of-the-art in GR for LRL.",

    "abstract": "Physical human-robot collaboration requires strict safety guarantees since\nrobots and humans work in a shared workspace. This letter presents a novel\ncontrol framework to handle safety-critical position-based constraints for\nhuman-robot physical interaction. The proposed methodology is based on\nadmittance control, exponential control barrier functions (ECBFs) and quadratic\nprogram (QP) to achieve compliance during the force interaction between human\nand robot, while simultaneously guaranteeing safety constraints. In particular,\nthe formulation of admittance control is rewritten as a second-order nonlinear\ncontrol system, and the interaction forces between humans and robots are\nregarded as the control input. A virtual force feedback for admittance control\nis provided in real-time by using the ECBFs-QP framework as a compensator of\nthe external human forces. A safe trajectory is therefore derived from the\nproposed adaptive admittance control scheme for a low-level controller to\ntrack. The innovation of the proposed approach is that the proposed controller\nwill enable the robot to comply with human forces with natural fluidity without\nviolation of any safety constraints even in cases where human external forces\nincidentally force the robot to violate constraints. The effectiveness of our\napproach is demonstrated in simulation studies on a two-link planar robot\nmanipulator.",

Common\nexamples of this scenario include using level set functions to represent\nmaterial interfaces in multimaterial configurations, and evolving geometries in\nshape and topology optimization. The proposed method formulates the mesh\noptimization problem as a variational minimization of the sum of a chosen\nmesh-quality metric using the Target-Matrix Optimization Paradigm (TMOP) and a\npenalty term that weakly forces the selected faces of the mesh to align with\nthe target surface. The distinct features of the method are use of a source\nmesh to represent the level set function with sufficient accuracy, and adaptive\nstrategies for setting the penalization weight and selecting the faces of the\nmesh to be fit to the target isocontour of the level set field.

The proposed\nmethod combines the benefits of compliance to external forces of admittance\ncontrol and high robustness to uncertainties of integral sliding mode control\n(ISMC), such that the system can collaborate with a human partner in an\nuncertain environment effectively. Firstly, a fixed-time sliding surface is\napplied in the ISMC to make the tracking error of the system converge within a\nfixed-time regardless of the initial condition. Then, a fixed-time backstepping\ncontroller (BSP) is integrated into the ISMC as the nominal controller to\nrealize global fixed-time convergence. Furthermore, to overcome the singularity\nproblem, a non-singular fixed-time sliding surface is designed and integrated\ninto the controller, which is useful for practical application. Finally, the\nproposed controller is validated for a two-link robot manipulator with\nuncertainties and external human forces. The results show that the proposed\ncontroller is superior in the sense of both tracking error and convergence\ntime, and at the same time, can comply with human motion in a shared workspace.",

    "abstract": "Visual neuroprostheses (bionic eyes) have the potential to treat degenerative\neye diseases that often result in low vision or complete blindness. These\ndevices rely on an external camera to capture the visual scene, which is then\ntranslated frame-by-frame into an electrical stimulation pattern that is sent\nto the implant in the eye. To highlight more meaningful information in the\nscene, recent studies have tested the effectiveness of deep-learning based\ncomputer vision techniques, such as depth estimation to highlight nearby\nobstacles (DepthOnly mode) and semantic edge detection to outline important\nobjects in the scene (EdgesOnly mode). However, nobody has attempted to combine\nthe two, either by presenting them together (EdgesAndDepth) or by giving the\nuser the ability to flexibly switch between them (EdgesOrDepth). Here, we used\na neurobiologically inspired model of simulated prosthetic vision (SPV) in an\nimmersive virtual reality (VR) environment to test the relative importance of\nsemantic edges and relative depth cues to support the ability to avoid\nobstacles and identify objects. We found that participants were significantly\nbetter at avoiding obstacles using depth-based cues as opposed to relying on\nedge information alone, and that roughly half the participants preferred the\nflexibility to switch between modes (EdgesOrDepth). This study highlights the\nrelative importance of depth cues for SPV mobility and is an important first\nstep towards a visual neuroprosthesis that uses computer vision to improve a\nuser's scene understanding.",

The\nfundamental idea of hybrid prototyping is to simulate a design with multiple\ncores by creating an emulation kernel in software on top of a single physical\ninstance of the core. However, so far hybrid prototyping has been limited to\nhomogeneous multicores running at the same clock frequency. Moreover, hybrid\nprototyping has not yet been demonstrated for efficient design space\nexploration.

Our\nexperiments using industrial strength applications such as JPEG, MP3 and Packet\nProcessing, demonstrate the high accuracy of our hybrid prototypes, and over\ntwo orders of magnitude improvement over software simulation speed.

    "title": "How can Email Interventions Increase Students' Completion of Online  Homework? A Case Study Using A/B Comparisons",
    "abstract": "Email communication between instructors and students is ubiquitous, and it\ncould be valuable to explore ways of testing out how to make email messages\nmore impactful. This paper explores the design space of using emails to get\nstudents to plan and reflect on starting weekly homework earlier. We deployed a\nseries of email reminders using randomized A/B comparisons to test alternative\nfactors in the design of these emails, providing examples of an experimental\nparadigm and metrics for a broader range of interventions. We also surveyed and\ninterviewed instructors and students to compare their predictions about the\neffectiveness of the reminders with their actual impact. We present our results\non which seemingly obvious predictions about effective emails are not borne\nout, despite there being evidence for further exploring these interventions, as\nthey can sometimes motivate students to attempt their homework more often. We\nalso present qualitative evidence about student opinions and behaviours after\nreceiving the emails, to guide further interventions. These findings provide\ninsight into how to use randomized A/B comparisons in everyday channels such as\nemails, to provide empirical evidence to test our beliefs about the\neffectiveness of alternative design choices.",

    "abstract": "The number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices being deployed into networks\nis growing at a phenomenal level, which makes IoT networks more vulnerable in\nthe wireless medium. Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is malicious to most of\nthe network facilities and the available attack data for training the machine\nlearning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is limited when compared to the\nnormal traffic. Therefore, it is quite challenging to enhance the detection\nperformance in order to mitigate the influence of APT. Therefore, Prior\nKnowledge Input (PKI) models are proposed and tested using the SCVIC-APT- 2021\ndataset. To obtain prior knowledge, the proposed PKI model pre-classifies the\noriginal dataset with unsupervised clustering method. Then, the obtained prior\nknowledge is incorporated into the supervised model to decrease training\ncomplexity and assist the supervised model in determining the optimal mapping\nbetween the raw data and true labels. The experimental findings indicate that\nthe PKI model outperforms the supervised baseline, with the best macro average\nF1-score of 81.37%, which is 10.47% higher than the baseline.",

    "title": "Increasing Students' Engagement to Reminder Emails Through Multi-Armed  Bandits",
    "abstract": "Conducting randomized experiments in education settings raises the question\nof how we can use machine learning techniques to improve educational\ninterventions. Using Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) algorithms like Thompson\nSampling (TS) in adaptive experiments can increase students' chances of\nobtaining better outcomes by increasing the probability of assignment to the\nmost optimal condition (arm), even before an intervention completes. This is an\nadvantage over traditional A/B testing, which may allocate an equal number of\nstudents to both optimal and non-optimal conditions. The problem is the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off. Even though adaptive policies aim to\ncollect enough information to allocate more students to better arms reliably,\npast work shows that this may not be enough exploration to draw reliable\nconclusions about whether arms differ. Hence, it is of interest to provide\nadditional uniform random (UR) exploration throughout the experiment. This\npaper shows a real-world adaptive experiment on how students engage with\ninstructors' weekly email reminders to build their time management habits. Our\nmetric of interest is open email rates which tracks the arms represented by\ndifferent subject lines. These are delivered following different allocation\nalgorithms: UR, TS, and what we identified as TS{\\dag} - which combines both TS\nand UR rewards to update its priors. We highlight problems with these adaptive\nalgorithms - such as possible exploitation of an arm when there is no\nsignificant difference - and address their causes and consequences. Future\ndirections includes studying situations where the early choice of the optimal\narm is not ideal and how adaptive algorithms can address them.",

    "abstract": "This study implements a novel Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) framework for\naddressing large complex socio-ecological problems. These are characterized as\nqualitative, dominated by uncertainty, human involvement with different and\nvague perceptions/expectations, and complex systems dynamics due to feedback\nrelations. The FCM framework provides a participatory soft computing approach\nto develop consensus solutions. We demonstrate its implementation in a case\nstudy: a national-scale acute water scarcity crisis. The model has eight steps\nstarting from collecting data from stakeholders in the form of FCMs\n(bi-directional graphs) represented by nodes and imprecise connections. All\nsubsequent steps operate within a new fuzzy 2-tuple framework that overcomes\nprevious FCM limitations through advanced processing methods, where large FCMs\nare fuzzified and analyzed, condensed, and aggregated using graph-theoretic\nmeasures. FCMs are simulated as Auto-Associative Neural Networks (AANN) to\nassess policy solutions to address the problem. In this study, very large\ncognitive maps were developed through interviews capturing perceptions of five\ndifferent stakeholder groups taking into consideration the causes, consequences\nand challenges of the acute water scarcity problem in Jordan. The complex FCMs\ncontaining 186 variables comprehensively covered all aspects of water scarcity.\nFCMs were condensed into smaller maps in two levels. They were also combined\ninto five stakeholder group FCMs and one whole system FCM (total 123 FCMs).\nAANN simulations of policy scenarios were conducted on the whole system FCM,\nfirst at the most condensed level and then moved top-down through the next two\nlevels of granularity to explore potential solutions. These were ranked by a\nnovel fuzzy Appropriateness criterion to provide a number of high level and\neffective strategies to mitigate the water crisis.",

    "abstract": "Instance segmentation on 3D point clouds has been attracting increasing\nattention due to its wide applications, especially in scene understanding\nareas. However, most existing methods require training data to be fully\nannotated. Manually preparing ground-truth labels at point-level is very\ncumbersome and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nweakly supervised method RWSeg that only requires labeling one object with one\npoint. With these sparse weak labels, we introduce a unified framework with two\nbranches to propagate semantic and instance information respectively to unknown\nregions, using self-attention and random walk. Furthermore, we propose a\nCross-graph Competing Random Walks (CGCRW) algorithm which encourages\ncompetition among different instance graphs to resolve ambiguities in closely\nplaced objects and improve the performance on instance assignment. RWSeg can\ngenerate qualitative instance-level pseudo labels. Experimental results on\nScanNet-v2 and S3DIS datasets show that our approach achieves comparable\nperformance with fully-supervised methods and outperforms previous\nweakly-supervised methods by large margins.

    "abstract": "Objective: Classifier transfers usually come with dataset shifts. To overcome\nthem, online strategies have to be applied. For practical applications,\nlimitations in the computational resources for the adaptation of batch learning\nalgorithms, like the SVM, have to be considered.\nApproach: We review and compare several strategies for online learning with\nSVMs. We focus on data selection strategies which limit the size of the stored\ntraining data [...]\nMain Results: For different data shifts, different criteria are appropriate.\nFor the synthetic data, adding all samples to the pool of considered samples\nperforms often significantly worse than other criteria. Especially, adding only\nmisclassified samples performed astoundingly well. Here, balancing criteria\nwere very important when the other criteria were not well chosen. For the\ntransfer setups, the results show that the best strategy depends on the\nintensity of the drift during the transfer. Adding all and removing the oldest\nsamples results in the best performance, whereas for smaller drifts, it can be\nsufficient to only add potential new support vectors of the SVM which reduces\nprocessing resources.\nSignificance: For BCIs based on EEG models, trained on data from a\ncalibration session, a previous recording session, or even from a recording\nsession with one or several other subjects, are used. This transfer of the\nlearned model usually decreases the performance and can therefore benefit from\nonline learning which adapts the classifier like the established SVM. We show\nthat by using the right combination of data selection criteria, it is possible\nto adapt the classifier and largely increase the performance. Furthermore, in\nsome cases it is possible to speed up the processing and save computational by\nupdating with a subset of special samples and keeping a small subset of samples\nfor training the classifier.",

    "abstract": "High dynamic range (HDR) deghosting algorithms aim to generate ghost-free HDR\nimages with realistic details. Restricted by the locality of the receptive\nfield, existing CNN-based methods are typically prone to producing ghosting\nartifacts and intensity distortions in the presence of large motion and severe\nsaturation. In this paper, we propose a novel Context-Aware Vision Transformer\n(CA-ViT) for ghost-free high dynamic range imaging. The CA-ViT is designed as a\ndual-branch architecture, which can jointly capture both global and local\ndependencies. Specifically, the global branch employs a window-based\nTransformer encoder to model long-range object movements and intensity\nvariations to solve ghosting. For the local branch, we design a local context\nextractor (LCE) to capture short-range image features and use the channel\nattention mechanism to select informative local details across the extracted\nfeatures to complement the global branch. By incorporating the CA-ViT as basic\ncomponents, we further build the HDR-Transformer, a hierarchical network to\nreconstruct high-quality ghost-free HDR images. Extensive experiments on three\nbenchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nqualitatively and quantitatively with considerably reduced computational\nbudgets.

A user can detect the presence of bias against a\ngroup, say females, or a subgroup, say black females, by identifying unfair\ncausal relationships in the causal network and using an array of fairness\nmetrics. Thereafter, the user can mitigate bias by acting on the unfair causal\nedges. For each interaction, say weakening/deleting a biased causal edge, the\nsystem uses a novel method to simulate a new (debiased) dataset based on the\ncurrent causal model. Users can visually assess the impact of their\ninteractions on different fairness metrics, utility metrics, data distortion,\nand the underlying data distribution. Once satisfied, they can download the\ndebiased dataset and use it for any downstream application for fairer\npredictions. We evaluate D-BIAS by conducting experiments on 3 datasets and\nalso a formal user study. We found that D-BIAS helps reduce bias significantly\ncompared to the baseline debiasing approach across different fairness metrics\nwhile incurring little data distortion and a small loss in utility. Moreover,\nour human-in-the-loop based approach significantly outperforms an automated\napproach on trust, interpretability and accountability.",

    "abstract": "The goal of robust reinforcement learning (RL) is to learn a policy that is\nrobust against the uncertainty in model parameters. Parameter uncertainty\ncommonly occurs in many real-world RL applications due to simulator modeling\nerrors, changes in the real-world system dynamics over time, and adversarial\ndisturbances. Robust RL is typically formulated as a max-min problem, where the\nobjective is to learn the policy that maximizes the value against the worst\npossible models that lie in an uncertainty set. In this work, we propose a\nrobust RL algorithm called Robust Fitted Q-Iteration (RFQI), which uses only an\noffline dataset to learn the optimal robust policy. Robust RL with offline data\nis significantly more challenging than its non-robust counterpart because of\nthe minimization over all models present in the robust Bellman operator. This\nposes challenges in offline data collection, optimization over the models, and\nunbiased estimation. In this work, we propose a systematic approach to overcome\nthese challenges, resulting in our RFQI algorithm. We prove that RFQI learns a\nnear-optimal robust policy under standard assumptions and demonstrate its\nsuperior performance on standard benchmark problems.",

Since videos with longer duration tend to have longer watch\ntime, there exists a kind of duration bias, making longer videos tend to be\nrecommended more against short videos. In this paper, we empirically show that\ncommonly-used metrics are vulnerable to duration bias, making them NOT suitable\nfor evaluating micro-video recommendation. To address it, we further propose an\nunbiased evaluation metric, called WTG (short for Watch Time Gain). Empirical\nresults reveal that WTG can alleviate duration bias and better measure\nrecommendation performance. Moreover, we design a simple yet effective model\nnamed DVR (short for Debiased Video Recommendation) that can provide unbiased\nrecommendation of micro-videos with varying duration, and learn unbiased user\npreferences via adversarial learning. Extensive experiments based on two\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that DVR successfully eliminates duration bias\nand significantly improves recommendation performance with over 30% relative\nprogress.

    "abstract": "In this work, we describe in detail how Deep Learning and Computer Vision can\nhelp to detect fault events of the AirTender system, an aftermarket motorcycle\ndamping system component. One of the most effective ways to monitor the\nAirTender functioning is to look for oil stains on its surface. Starting from\nreal-time images, AirTender is first detected in the motorbike suspension\nsystem and then a binary classifier determines whether AirTender is spilling\noil or not. The detection is made with the help of the Yolo5 architecture,\nwhereas the classification is carried out with the help of a suitably designed\nConvolutional Neural Network, OilNet40. In order to detect oil leaks more\nclearly, we dilute the oil in AirTender with a fluorescent dye with excitation\nwavelength peak of approximately 390 nm. AirTender is then illuminated with\nsuitable UV LEDs. The whole system is an attempt to design a low-cost detection\nsetup. An on-board device, such as a mini-computer, is placed near the\nsuspension system and connected to a full hd camera framing AirTender. The\non-board device, through our Neural Network algorithm, is then able to localize\nand classify AirTender as normally functioning (non-leak image) or anomaly\n(leak image).",

In a system\nwith $N_t$ transmit antennas employing $M$-ary modulation, the ML-MIMO detector\nrequires $M^{N_t}$ cost function (CF) evaluations followed by a search\noperation for detecting the symbol with the minimum CF value. However, a\npractical system needs the bit-error ratio (BER) to be application-dependent\nwhich could be sub-optimal. This implies that it may not be necessary to have\nthe minimal CF solution all the time. Rather it is desirable to search for a\nsolution that meets the required sub-optimal BER.

In this paper, we propose ModularHI, a\nmodular approach in the construction of HI for a system without historical\ndata. With ModularHI, the operator chooses which sensor inputs are available,\nand then ModularHI will compute a baseline model based on data collected during\na burn-in state.

    "abstract": "Capturing an event from multiple camera angles can give a viewer the most\ncomplete and interesting picture of that event. To be suitable for\nbroadcasting, a human director needs to decide what to show at each point in\ntime. This can become cumbersome with an increasing number of camera angles.\nThe introduction of omnidirectional or wide-angle cameras has allowed for\nevents to be captured more completely, making it even more difficult for the\ndirector to pick a good shot. In this paper, a system is presented that, given\nmultiple ultra-high resolution video streams of an event, can generate a\nvisually pleasing sequence of shots that manages to follow the relevant action\nof an event. Due to the algorithm being general purpose, it can be applied to\nmost scenarios that feature humans. The proposed method allows for online\nprocessing when real-time broadcasting is required, as well as offline\nprocessing when the quality of the camera operation is the priority. Object\ndetection is used to detect humans and other objects of interest in the input\nstreams. Detected persons of interest, along with a set of rules based on\ncinematic conventions, are used to determine which video stream to show and\nwhat part of that stream is virtually framed. The user can provide a number of\nsettings that determine how these rules are interpreted. The system is able to\nhandle input from different wide-angle video streams by removing lens\ndistortions. Using a user study it is shown, for a number of different\nscenarios, that the proposed automated director is able to capture an event\nwith aesthetically pleasing video compositions and human-like shot switching\nbehavior.",

In a point cloud sequence, 3D\nobject tracking aims to predict the location and orientation of an object in\nconsecutive frames given an object template. Motivated by the success of\ntransformers, we propose Point Tracking TRansformer (PTTR), which efficiently\npredicts high-quality 3D tracking results in a coarse-to-fine manner with the\nhelp of transformer operations. PTTR consists of three novel designs. 1)\nInstead of random sampling, we design Relation-Aware Sampling to preserve\nrelevant points to the given template during subsampling. 2) We propose a Point\nRelation Transformer for effective feature aggregation and feature matching\nbetween the template and search region. 3) Based on the coarse tracking\nresults, we employ a novel Prediction Refinement Module to obtain the final\nrefined prediction through local feature pooling. In addition, motivated by the\nfavorable properties of the Bird's-Eye View (BEV) of point clouds in capturing\nobject motion, we further design a more advanced framework named PTTR++, which\nincorporates both the point-wise view and BEV representation to exploit their\ncomplementary effect in generating high-quality tracking results.

As a result,\ndealing with the words not occurring during training (a.k.a. out-of-vocabulary\n(OOV) words) have long been a fundamental challenge for NMT systems. The\npredominant method to tackle this problem is Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) which\nsplits words, including OOV words, into sub-word segments. BPE has achieved\nimpressive results for a wide range of translation tasks in terms of automatic\nevaluation metrics. While it is often assumed that by using BPE, NMT systems\nare capable of handling OOV words, the effectiveness of BPE in translating OOV\nwords has not been explicitly measured. In this paper, we study to what extent\nBPE is successful in translating OOV words at the word-level. We analyze the\ntranslation quality of OOV words based on word type, number of segments,\ncross-attention weights, and the frequency of segment n-grams in the training\ndata. Our experiments show that while careful BPE settings seem to be fairly\nuseful in translating OOV words across datasets, a considerable percentage of\nOOV words are translated incorrectly. Furthermore, we highlight the slightly\nhigher effectiveness of BPE in translating OOV words for special cases, such as\nnamed-entities and when the languages involved are linguistically close to each\nother.",

    "abstract": "We present a framework for the structure-preserving approximation of partial\ndifferential equations on mapped multipatch domains, extending the classical\ntheory of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) to discrete de Rham sequences\nwhich are broken, i.e., fully discontinuous across the patch interfaces.\nFollowing the Conforming/Nonconforming Galerkin (CONGA) schemes developed in\n[this http URL, arXiv:2109.02553, our approach is based\non: (i) the identification of a conforming discrete de Rham sequence with\nstable commuting projection operators, (ii) the relaxation of the continuity\nconstraints between patches, and (iii) the construction of conforming\nprojections mapping back to the conforming subspaces, allowing to define\ndiscrete differentials on the broken sequence.\nThis framework combines the advantages of conforming FEEC discretizations\n(e.g. commuting projections, discrete duality and Hodge-Helmholtz\ndecompositions) with the data locality and implementation simplicity of\ninterior penalty methods for discontinuous Galerkin discretizations. We apply\nit to several initial- and boundary-value problems, as well as eigenvalue\nproblems arising in electromagnetics. In each case our formulations are shown\nto be well posed thanks to an appropriate stabilization of the jumps across the\ninterfaces, and the solutions are extremely robust with respect to the\nstabilization parameter.\nFinally we describe a construction using tensor-product splines on mapped\ncartesian patches, and we detail the associated matrix operators. Our numerical\nexperiments confirm the accuracy and stability of this discrete framework, and\nthey allow us to verify that expected structure-preserving properties such as\ndivergence or harmonic constraints are respected to floating-point accuracy.",

    "title": "Learning Degradation Representations for Image Deblurring",
    "abstract": "In various learning-based image restoration tasks, such as image denoising\nand image super-resolution, the degradation representations were widely used to\nmodel the degradation process and handle complicated degradation patterns.\nHowever, they are less explored in learning-based image deblurring as blur\nkernel estimation cannot perform well in real-world challenging cases. We argue\nthat it is particularly necessary for image deblurring to model degradation\nrepresentations since blurry patterns typically show much larger variations\nthan noisy patterns or high-frequency textures.In this paper, we propose a\nframework to learn spatially adaptive degradation representations of blurry\nimages. A novel joint image reblurring and deblurring learning process is\npresented to improve the expressiveness of degradation representations. To make\nlearned degradation representations effective in reblurring and deblurring, we\npropose a Multi-Scale Degradation Injection Network (MSDI-Net) to integrate\nthem into the neural networks. With the integration, MSDI-Net can handle\nvarious and complicated blurry patterns adaptively. Experiments on the GoPro\nand RealBlur datasets demonstrate that our proposed deblurring framework with\nthe learned degradation representations outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nwith appealing improvements.

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based crowd counting methods have achieved\npromising results in the past few years. However, the scale variation problem\nis still a huge challenge for accurate count estimation. In this paper, we\npropose a multi-scale feature aggregation network (MSFANet) that can alleviate\nthis problem to some extent. Specifically, our approach consists of two feature\naggregation modules: the short aggregation (ShortAgg) and the skip aggregation\n(SkipAgg). The ShortAgg module aggregates the features of the adjacent\nconvolution blocks. Its purpose is to make features with different receptive\nfields fused gradually from the bottom to the top of the network. The SkipAgg\nmodule directly propagates features with small receptive fields to features\nwith much larger receptive fields. Its purpose is to promote the fusion of\nfeatures with small and large receptive fields. Especially, the SkipAgg module\nintroduces the local self-attention features from the Swin Transformer blocks\nto incorporate rich spatial information. Furthermore, we present a\nlocal-and-global based counting loss by considering the non-uniform crowd\ndistribution. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets (ShanghaiTech\ndataset, UCF_CC_50 dataset, UCF-QNRF Dataset, WorldExpo'10 dataset) demonstrate\nthe proposed easy-to-implement MSFANet can achieve promising results when\ncompared with the previous state-of-the-art approaches.",

A sensor array is called low-redundancy\nif the ratio $R=N(N-1)/(2L)$ is approaching the Leech's bound $1.217\\leq\nR_{opt}\\leq 1.332$, where $N$ is the physical sensor number and $L$ is the\nmaximum inter-sensor spacing of the sensor array.

The new array preserves all the good properties of existing\nsparse arrays, namely, the different co-array is hole-free, and the sensor\nlocations are uniquely determined by a closed-form expression as a function of\nthe number of sensors. Notably, compared to existing sparse arrays, the\nproposed array can significantly reduce the effects of mutual coupling between\nsensors, by decreasing the number of sensor pairs with minimum inter-spacing to\nthe lowest number 1.

    "abstract": "Virtualized Radio Access Networks (vRANs) are fully configurable and can be\nimplemented at low cost over commodity platforms offering unprecedented network\nmanagement flexibility. In this paper, a novel deep Reinforcement Learning\n(RL)-based framework is proposed that jointly reconfigures the functional\nsplits of the Base Stations (BSs), resources and locations of the virtualized\nCentral Units (vCUs) and Distributed Units (vDUs), and the routing for each BS\ndata flow. The objective is to minimize the long-term total network operation\ncost while adapting to the possibly-varying traffic demands and resource\navailability. Testbed measurements are performed to study the relations between\ntraffic demands and computing resource utilization, which reveal that their\nrelations have high variance and dependence on platform and platform load.\nHence, acquiring the perfect model of the underlying vRAN system is highly\nnon-trivial. A comprehensive cost function is formulated that considers\nresource overprovisioning, instantiation and reconfiguration and the declined\ndemands, where such impacts urge to perform the reconfigurations prudently.\nMotivated by these insights, our solution framework is developed using\nmodel-free multi-agent RL, where each agent controls the configurations of each\nBS. However, each agent has a multi-dimensional discrete action space due to\nthe joint configuration decision of the BS. To overcome the curse of\ndimensionality, incorporation of Dueling Double Q-network with action branching\nis applied at each agent. Further, the agent learns its optimal policy to\nselect an action that reconfigures the BS independently. Simulations are\nperformed using O-RAN compliant model. Our results show that the framework\nsuccessfully learns the optimal policy, can be readily applied to different\nvRAN systems via transfer learning, and achieves significant cost savings of\nthe benchmarks.",

    "title": "Adaptive Learning Rates for Faster Stochastic Gradient Methods",
    "abstract": "In this work, we propose new adaptive step size strategies that improve\nseveral stochastic gradient methods. Our first method (StoPS) is based on the\nclassical Polyak step size (Polyak, 1987) and is an extension of the recent\ndevelopment of this method for the stochastic optimization-SPS (Loizou et al.,\n2021), and our second method, denoted GraDS, rescales step size by \"diversity\nof stochastic gradients\". We provide a theoretical analysis of these methods\nfor strongly convex smooth functions and show they enjoy deterministic-like\nrates despite stochastic gradients. Furthermore, we demonstrate the theoretical\nsuperiority of our adaptive methods on quadratic objectives. Unfortunately,\nboth StoPS and GraDS depend on unknown quantities, which are only practical for\nthe overparametrized models. To remedy this, we drop this undesired dependence\nand redefine StoPS and GraDS to StoP and GraD, respectively. We show that these\nnew methods converge linearly to the neighbourhood of the optimal solution\nunder the same assumptions. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical claims by\nexperimental validation, which reveals that GraD is particularly useful for\ndeep learning optimization.",

    "abstract": "Traditional computers with von Neumann architecture are unable to meet the\nlatency and scalability challenges of Deep Neural Network (DNN) workloads.\nVarious DNN accelerators based on Conventional compute Hardware Accelerator\n(CHA), Near-Data-Processing (NDP) and Processing-in-Memory (PIM) paradigms have\nbeen proposed to meet these challenges. Our goal in this work is to perform a\nrigorous comparison among the state-of-the-art accelerators from DNN\naccelerator paradigms, we have used unique layers from MobileNet, ResNet, BERT,\nand DLRM of MLPerf Inference benchmark for our analysis. The detailed models\nare based on hardware-realized state-of-the art designs. We observe that for\nmemory-intensive Fully Connected Layer (FCL) DNNs, NDP based accelerator is\n10.6x faster than the state-of-the-art CHA and 39.9x faster than PIM based\naccelerator for inferencing. For compute-intensive image classification and\nobject detection DNNs, the state-of-the-art CHA is ~10x faster than NDP and\n~2000x faster than the PIM-based accelerator for inferencing. PIM-based\naccelerators are suitable for DNN applications where energy is a constraint\n(~2.7x and ~21x lower energy for CNN and FCL applications, respectively, than\nconventional ASIC systems). Further, we identify architectural changes (such as\nincreasing memory bandwidth, buffer reorganization) that can increase\nthroughput (up to linear increase) and lower energy (up to linear decrease) for\nML applications with a detailed sensitivity analysis of relevant components in\nCHA, NDP and PIM based accelerators.",

    "abstract": "Improvements in the performance of computing systems, driven by Moore's Law,\nhave transformed society. As such hardware-driven gains slow down, it becomes\neven more important for software developers to focus on performance and\nefficiency during development. While several studies have demonstrated the\npotential from such improved code efficiency (e.g., 2x better generational\nimprovements compared to hardware), unlocking these gains in practice has been\nchallenging. Reasoning about algorithmic complexity and the interaction of\ncoding patterns on hardware can be challenging for the average programmer,\nespecially when combined with pragmatic constraints around development velocity\nand multi-person development.\nThis paper seeks to address this problem. We analyze a large competitive\nprogramming dataset from the Google Code Jam competition and find that\nefficient code is indeed rare, with a 2x runtime difference between the median\nand the 90th percentile of solutions. We propose using machine learning to\nautomatically provide prescriptive feedback in the form of hints, to guide\nprogrammers towards writing high-performance code. To automatically learn these\nhints from the dataset, we propose a novel discrete variational auto-encoder,\nwhere each discrete latent variable represents a different learned category of\ncode-edit that increases performance. We show that this method represents the\nmulti-modal space of code efficiency edits better than a sequence-to-sequence\nbaseline and generates a distribution of more efficient solutions.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the potential of the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)\nin realizing multi-user concurrent communication and localization, using the\nsame time-frequency resources. Specifically, we propose an IRS-enabled\nmulti-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework, where a\ndistributed semi-passive IRS assists the uplink data transmission from multiple\nusers to the base station (BS) and conducts multi-user localization,\nsimultaneously. We first design an ISAC transmission protocol, where the whole\ntransmission period consists of two periods, i.e., the ISAC period for\nsimultaneous uplink communication and multi-user localization, and the pure\ncommunication (PC) period for only uplink data transmission. For the ISAC\nperiod, we propose a multi-user location sensing algorithm, which utilizes the\nuplink communication signals unknown to the IRS, thus removing the requirement\nof dedicated positioning reference signals in conventional location sensing\nmethods. Based on the sensed users' locations, we propose two novel beamforming\nalgorithms for the ISAC period and PC period, respectively, which can work with\ndiscrete phase shifts and require no channel state information (CSI)\nacquisition. Numerical results show that the proposed multi-user location\nsensing algorithm can achieve up to millimeter-level positioning accuracy,\nindicating the advantage of the IRS-enabled ISAC framework. Moreover, the\nproposed beamforming algorithms with sensed location information and discrete\nphase shifts can achieve comparable performance to the benchmark considering\nperfect CSI acquisition and continuous phase shifts, demonstrating how the\nlocation information can ensure the communication performance.",

In contrast to\nmesh-based methods, where mesh distortion may pose numerical challenges,\nmeshless methods are more suitable for large deformation modelling since they\nuse enriched shape functions for the approximation of displacements. However,\nthis comes at the expense of extra computational overhead and higher-order\nquadrature is required to obtain accurate results. In this work, the novel\nmeshless method FPM was used to derive an explicit total Lagrangian algorithm\nfor finite deformation. FPM uses simple one-point integration for exact\nintegration of the Galerkin weak form since it employs simple discontinuous\npolynomials as trial and test functions, leading to accurate results even with\nsingle-point quadrature. The proposed method was evaluated by comparing it with\nFEM in several case studies considering both the extension and compression of a\nhyperelastic material. It was demonstrated that FPM maintained good accuracy\neven for large deformations where FEM failed to converge.",

Previous work has been limited in several ways: it often\nresorts to artificial settings where the problem is amplified, it disregards\nsome (common) types of hallucinations, and it does not validate adequacy of\ndetection heuristics. In this paper, we set foundations for the study of NMT\nhallucinations. First, we work in a natural setting, i.e., in-domain data\nwithout artificial noise neither in training nor in inference. Next, we\nannotate a dataset of over 3.4k sentences indicating different kinds of\ncritical errors and hallucinations. Then, we turn to detection methods and both\nrevisit methods used previously and propose using glass-box uncertainty-based\ndetectors. Overall, we show that for preventive settings, (i) previously used\nmethods are largely inadequate, (ii) sequence log-probability works best and\nperforms on par with reference-based methods. Finally, we propose\nDeHallucinator, a simple method for alleviating hallucinations at test time\nthat significantly reduces the hallucinatory rate.

    "abstract": "Skeleton-based action recognition has drawn a lot of attention for its\ncomputation efficiency and robustness to lighting conditions. Existing\nskeleton-based action recognition methods are typically formulated as a one-hot\nclassification task without fully utilizing the semantic relations between\nactions. For example, \"make victory sign\" and \"thumb up\" are two actions of\nhand gestures, whose major difference lies in the movement of hands. This\ninformation is agnostic from the categorical one-hot encoding of action classes\nbut could be unveiled in the language description of actions. Therefore,\nutilizing action language descriptions in training could potentially benefit\nrepresentation learning. In this work, we propose a Language Supervised\nTraining (LST) approach for skeleton-based action recognition. More\nspecifically, we employ a large-scale language model as the knowledge engine to\nprovide text descriptions for body parts movements of actions, and propose a\nmulti-modal training scheme by utilizing the text encoder to generate feature\nvectors for different body parts and supervise the skeleton encoder for action\nrepresentation learning. Experiments show that our proposed LST method achieves\nnoticeable improvements over various baseline models without extra computation\ncost at inference.

However, to\nbe effective, these systems need to collect and analyze large volumes of\npersonal data (e.g., location check-ins, movie ratings, click rates .. etc.),\nwhich exposes users to numerous privacy threats. In this context, recommender\nsystems based on Federated Learning (FL) appear to be a promising solution for\nenforcing privacy as they compute accurate recommendations while keeping\npersonal data on the users' devices.

In this paper, we consider an IRS-aided NO-ISAC system, where\na distributed IRS is deployed to assist concurrent communication and location\nsensing for a blind-zone user, occupying non-orthogonal/overlapped\ntime-frequency resources.

In addition, by exploiting the modified CRLB, we propose a joint\nactive and passive beamforming design algorithm that achieves a good\ncommunication and location sensing trade-off. Through numerical results, we\ndemonstrate the superiority of the IRS-aided NO-ISAC systems over the IRS-aided\nTD-ISAC systems, in terms of both communication and localization performances.\nBesides, it is shown that the IRS-aided NO-ISAC system with random\ncommunication signals can achieve comparable localization performance to the\nIRS-aided localization system with dedicated positioning reference signals.\nMoreover, we investigate the trade-off between communication performance and\nlocalization performance and show how the performance of the NO-ISAC system can\nbe significantly boosted by increasing the number of the IRS elements.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven programming feedback systems can help novices to program in the\nabsence of a human tutor. Prior evaluations showed that these systems improve\nlearning in terms of test scores, or task completion efficiency. However,\ncrucial aspects which can impact learning or reveal insights important for\nfuture improvement of such systems are ignored in these evaluations. These\naspects include inherent fallibility of current state-of-the-art, students'\nprogramming behavior in response to correct/incorrect feedback, and\neffective/ineffective system components. Consequently, a great deal of\nknowledge is yet to be discovered about such systems. In this paper, we apply a\nmulti-criteria evaluation with 5 criteria on a data-driven feedback system\nintegrated within a block-based novice programming environment. Each criterion\nin the evaluation reveals a unique pivotal aspect of the system: 1) How\naccurate the feedback system is; 2) How it guides students throughout\nprogramming tasks; 3) How it helps students in task completion; 4) What happens\nwhen it goes wrong; and 5) How students respond generally to the system. Our\nevaluation results showed that the system was helpful to students due to its\neffective design and feedback representation despite being fallible. However,\nnovices can be negatively impacted by this fallibility due to high reliance and\nlack of self-evaluation. The negative impacts include increased working time,\nimplementation, or submission of incorrect/partially correct solutions. The\nevaluation results reinforced the necessity of multi-criteria system\nevaluations while revealing important insights helpful to ensuring proper usage\nof data-driven feedback systems, designing fallibility mitigation steps, and\ndriving research for future improvement.",

Production systems need to\nidentify the items rapidly from very large catalogues which can be efficiently\nsolved using maximum inner product search technology. Offline optimisation of\nmaximum inner product search can be achieved by a relaxation of the discrete\nproblem resulting in policy learning or reinforce style learning algorithms.\nUnfortunately this relaxation step requires computing a sum over the entire\ncatalogue making the complexity of the evaluation of the gradient (and hence\neach stochastic gradient descent iterations) linear in the catalogue size. This\ncalculation is untenable in many real world examples such as large catalogue\nrecommender systems severely limiting the usefulness of this method in\npractice. In this paper we show how it is possible to produce an excellent\napproximation of these policy learning algorithms that scale logarithmically\nwith the catalogue size. Our contribution is based upon combining three novel\nideas: a new Monte Carlo estimate of the gradient of a policy, the self\nnormalised importance sampling estimator and the use of fast maximum inner\nproduct search at training time. Extensive experiments show our algorithm is an\norder of magnitude faster than naive approaches yet produces equally good\npolicies.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a global epidemic causing at least 2.8 million deaths per year.\nThis complex disease is associated with significant socioeconomic burden,\nreduced work productivity, unemployment, and other social determinants of\nHealth (SDoH) disparities. Objective: The objective of this study was to\ninvestigate the effects of SDoH on obesity prevalence among adults in Shelby\nCounty, Tennessee, USA using a geospatial machine-learning approach. Obesity\nprevalence was obtained from publicly available CDC 500 cities database while\nSDoH indicators were extracted from the U.S. Census and USDA. We examined the\ngeographic distributions of obesity prevalence patterns using Getis-Ord Gi*\nstatistics and calibrated multiple models to study the association between SDoH\nand adult obesity. Also, unsupervised machine learning was used to conduct\ngrouping analysis to investigate the distribution of obesity prevalence and\nassociated SDoH indicators. Results depicted a high percentage of neighborhoods\nexperiencing high adult obesity prevalence within Shelby County. In the census\ntract, median household income, as well as the percentage of individuals who\nwere black, home renters, living below the poverty level, fifty-five years or\nolder, unmarried, and uninsured, had a significant association with adult\nobesity prevalence. The grouping analysis revealed disparities in obesity\nprevalence amongst disadvantaged neighborhoods. More research is needed that\nexamines linkages between geographical location, SDoH, and chronic diseases.\nThese findings, which depict a significantly higher prevalence of obesity\nwithin disadvantaged neighborhoods, and other geospatial information can be\nleveraged to offer valuable insights informing health decision-making and\ninterventions that mitigate risk factors for increasing obesity prevalence.",

Existing methods on this topic have explored utilizing\nutterance-level style labels to perform style transfer via either global or\nlocal scale style representations. However, audiobook datasets are typically\ncharacterized by both the local prosody and global genre, and are rarely\naccompanied by utterance-level style labels.

Moreover, by\ndisentangling speaker timbre and style with the proposed switchable adversarial\nclassifiers, the extracted reading style is made adaptable to the timbre of\ndifferent speakers.

These spatiotemporal datasets create opportunities for new\nvisualizations to engage experts from different domains to study the dynamic\nbehavior of urban spaces in this under explored dimension. However, designing\n3D spatiotemporal urban visualizations is challenging, as it requires visual\nstrategies to support analysis of time-varying data referent to the city\ngeometry. Although different visual strategies have been used in 3D urban\nvisual analytics, the question of how effective these visual designs are at\nsupporting spatiotemporal analysis on building surfaces remains open. To\ninvestigate this, in this paper we first contribute a series of analytical\ntasks elicited after interviews with practitioners from three urban domains. We\nalso contribute a quantitative user study comparing the effectiveness of four\nrepresentative visual designs used to visualize 3D spatiotemporal urban data:\nspatial juxtaposition, temporal juxtaposition, linked view, and embedded view.\nParticipants performed a series of tasks that required them to identify extreme\nvalues on building surfaces over time. Tasks varied in granularity for both\nspace and time dimensions. Our results demonstrate that participants were more\naccurate using plot-based visualizations (linked view, embedded view) but\nfaster using color-coded visualizations (spatial juxtaposition, temporal\njuxtaposition). Our results also show that, with increasing task complexity,\nplot-based visualizations perform better in preserving efficiency (time,\naccuracy) compared to color-coded visualizations. Based on our findings, we\npresent a set of takeaways with design recommendations for 3D spatiotemporal\nurban visualizations for researchers and practitioners.",

    "abstract": "The importance of research teams' diversity for the progress of science is\nhighlighted extensively. Despite the seemingly hegemonic role of hypothesis\ntesting in modern quantitative research, little attention has been devoted to\nthe diversity of quantitative methods, epitomized by the linear model framework\nof analysis. Using bibliometric data from the Web of Science, we conduct a\nlarge-scale and cross-disciplinary assessment of the prevalence of\nlinear-model-based research from 1990 to 2022. In absolute terms, linear models\nare widely used across all fields of science. In relative terms, three patterns\nsuggest linear models are hegemonic among Social Sciences. First, there is a\nhigh and growing prevalence of linear-model-based research. Second, global\npatterns of linear-model-based research prevalence align with global\ninequalities in knowledge production. Third, there was a citation premium to\nlinear-model-based research until 2012 for articles' number of citations and\nfor the entire period in terms of having at least one citation. Previous\nresearch suggests that the confluence of these patterns may be detrimental to\nthe Social Sciences as it potentially marginalizes theories incompatible with\nthe linear models' framework, lowers the diversity of narratives about social\nphenomena, and prevents innovative and path-breaking research, limiting the\nbreadth of research.",

To realize this\ncharacteristic, we proposed a vision-based system to monitor the subject's\nmovement and automatically update the scan trajectory thus seamlessly obtaining\na complete 3D image of the target anatomy. The motion monitoring module is\ndeveloped using the segmented object masks from RGB images. Once the subject is\nmoved, the robot will stop and recompute a suitable trajectory by registering\nthe surface point clouds of the object obtained before and after the movement\nusing the iterative closest point algorithm.

The\nmemory of ATLAS is imperfect, with some off-target effects during continual\nlearning, but it is well-behaved and predictable. An efficient implementation\nof ATLAS is provided.

Given\na sequence of nested failure domains of increasing size, the rare event\nprobability is expressed as a product of conditional probabilities. The\nproposed new estimator uses different model resolutions and varying numbers of\nsamples across the hierarchy of nested failure sets. In order to dramatically\nreduce the computational cost, we construct the intermediate failure sets such\nthat only a small number of expensive high-resolution model evaluations are\nneeded, whilst the majority of samples can be taken from inexpensive\nlow-resolution simulations. A key idea in our new estimator is the use of a\nposteriori error estimators combined with a selective mesh refinement strategy\nto guarantee the critical subset property that may be violated when changing\nmodel resolution from one failure set to the next. The efficiency gains and the\nstatistical properties of the estimator are investigated both theoretically via\nshaking transformations, as well as numerically.

Previous works show competitive ratios of\n$1/(10e)$ (Babaioff et al.), $1/8.06$ (Kesselheim et al.; STOC 2014), and\n$1/6.65$ (Albers, Khan, and Ladewig; APPROX 2019) for the general problem but\nno definitive answers for the achievable competitive ratio; the best known\nimpossibility remains $1/e$ as inherited from the classic secretary problem. In\nan effort to make more qualitative progress, we take an orthogonal approach and\ngive definitive answers for special cases.\nOur main result is on the $1$-$2$-knapsack secretary problem, the special\ncase in which $B=2$ and all items have sizes $1$ or $2$, arguably the simplest\nmeaningful generalization of the secretary problem towards the knapsack\nsecretary problem. Our algorithm is simple: It $\\textit{boosts}$ the value of\nsize-$1$ items by a factor $\\alpha>1$ and then uses the size-oblivious approach\nby Albers, Khan, and Ladewig.

However, due to anatomical and physiological\nvariations between patients and relative movement of anatomical substructures,\nit is challenging to robustly generate optimal trajectories to examine the\nanatomies of interest, in particular, when they comprise articulated joints. To\naddress this challenge, this paper proposes a vision-based approach allowing\nautonomous robotic US limb scanning. To this end, an atlas MRI template of a\nhuman arm with annotated vascular structures is used to generate trajectories\nand register and project them onto patients' skin surfaces for robotic US\nacquisition. To effectively segment and accurately reconstruct the targeted 3D\nvessel, we make use of spatial continuity in consecutive US frames by\nincorporating channel attention modules into a U-Net-type neural network. The\nautomatic trajectory generation method is evaluated on six volunteers with\nvarious articulated joint angles. In all cases, the system can successfully\nacquire the planned vascular structure on volunteers' limbs. For one volunteer\nthe MRI scan was also available, which allows the evaluation of the average\nradius of the scanned artery from US images, resulting in a radius estimation\n($1.2\\pm0.05~mm$) comparable to the MRI ground truth ($1.2\\pm0.04~mm$).",

    "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) and face forgery detection play vital roles in\nsecuring face biometric systems from presentation attacks (PAs) and vicious\ndigital manipulation (e.g., deepfakes). Despite promising performance upon\nlarge-scale data and powerful deep models, the generalization problem of\nexisting approaches is still an open issue. Most of recent approaches focus on\n1) unimodal visual appearance or physiological (i.e., remote\nphotoplethysmography (rPPG)) cues; and 2) separated feature representation for\nFAS or face forgery detection. On one side, unimodal appearance and rPPG\nfeatures are respectively vulnerable to high-fidelity face 3D mask and video\nreplay attacks, inspiring us to design reliable multi-modal fusion mechanisms\nfor generalized face attack detection. On the other side, there are rich common\nfeatures across FAS and face forgery detection tasks (e.g., periodic rPPG\nrhythms and vanilla appearance for bonafides), providing solid evidence to\ndesign a joint FAS and face forgery detection system in a multi-task learning\nfashion. In this paper, we establish the first joint face spoofing and forgery\ndetection benchmark using both visual appearance and physiological rPPG cues.\nTo enhance the rPPG periodicity discrimination, we design a two-branch\nphysiological network using both facial spatio-temporal rPPG signal map and its\ncontinuous wavelet transformed counterpart as inputs. To mitigate the modality\nbias and improve the fusion efficacy, we conduct a weighted batch and layer\nnormalization for both appearance and rPPG features before multi-modal fusion.\nWe find that the generalization capacities of both unimodal (appearance or\nrPPG) and multi-modal (appearance+rPPG) models can be obviously improved via\njoint training on these two tasks. We hope this new benchmark will facilitate\nthe future research of both FAS and deepfake detection communities.",

The probability measures of these processes have\nrandom parameters that must be estimated. Specifically, they share a parameter\n$\\theta$ common to all probability measures. Additionally, each process\n$i\\in\\{1, \\dots, K\\}$ has a private parameter $\\alpha_i$. The objective is to\ndesign an active sampling algorithm for sequentially estimating these\nparameters in order to form reliable estimates for all shared and private\nparameters with the fewest number of samples. This sampling algorithm has three\nkey components: (i)~data-driven sampling decisions, which dynamically over time\nspecifies which of the $K$ processes should be selected for sampling;\n(ii)~stopping time for the process, which specifies when the accumulated data\nis sufficient to form reliable estimates and terminate the sampling process;\nand (iii)~estimators for all shared and private parameters. Owing to the\nsequential estimation being known to be analytically intractable, this paper\nadopts \\emph {conditional} estimation cost functions, leading to a sequential\nestimation approach that was recently shown to render tractable analysis.\nAsymptotically optimal decision rules (sampling, stopping, and estimation) are\ndelineated, and numerical experiments are provided to compare the efficacy and\nquality of the proposed procedure with those of the relevant approaches.",

    "abstract": "Aggregating messages is a key component for the communication of multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (Comm-MARL). Recently, it has witnessed the prevalence\nof graph attention networks (GAT) in Comm-MARL, where agents can be represented\nas nodes and messages can be aggregated via the weighted passing. While\nsuccessful, GAT can lead to homogeneity in the strategies of message\naggregation, and the \"core\" agent may excessively influence other agents'\nbehaviors, which can severely limit the multi-agent coordination. To address\nthis challenge, we first study the adjacency tensor of the communication graph\nand show that the homogeneity of message aggregation could be measured by the\nnormalized tensor rank. Since the rank optimization problem is known to be\nNP-hard, we define a new nuclear norm to replace the rank, a convex surrogate\nof normalized tensor rank. Leveraging the norm, we further propose a\nplug-and-play regularizer on the adjacency tensor, named Normalized Tensor\nNuclear Norm Regularization (NTNNR), to enrich the diversity of message\naggregation actively. We extensively evaluate GAT with the proposed regularizer\nin both cooperative and mixed cooperative-competitive scenarios. The results\ndemonstrate that aggregating messages using NTNNR-enhanced GAT can improve the\nefficiency of the training and achieve higher asymptotic performance than\nexisting message aggregation methods. When NTNNR is applied to existing\ngraph-attention Comm-MARL methods, we also observe significant performance\nimprovements on the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmarks.",

For example, QUIC's connection migration\nfeature provides mobility at L4.\nIn this paper we present a reflection around these changes, and attempt to\nformalize them by adding two additional protocol headers to the TCP/IP stack:\none for security, and another for new functionalities. We must note that we are\nnot presenting a new architecture, but trying to draw up what it's already out\nthere. In addition, we elaborate on the forces that have brought us here, and\nwe enumerate current proposals that are shaping these new headers.

Conventional ultra-reliable and low-latency\ncommunications (URLLC) can satisfy the vast majority of objective service KPIs,\nbut it is difficult to offer users a personalized experience in Metaverse\nservices. Since increasing the quality of experience (QoE) can be regarded as\nan imperative KPI, the URLLC is evolved towards the next generation URLLC\n(xURLLC) to support Metaverse services based on graphical technology. By\nallocating more resources to virtual objects in which users are more\ninterested, a higher QoE can be achieved. In this paper, we study the\ninteraction between the Metaverse service provider (MSP) and the network\ninfrastructure provider (InP) to deploy Metaverse xURLLC services. An optimal\ncontract design framework is provided. Specifically, the utility of the MSP,\ndefined as a function of Metaverse users' QoE, is to be maximized, while\nensuring the incentives of the InP. To model the QoE of Metaverse xURLLC\nservices, we propose a novel metric named Meta-Immersion that incorporates both\nthe objective network KPIs and subjective feelings of Metaverse users. Using a\nuser-object-attention level (UOAL) dataset, we develop and validate an\nattention-aware rendering capacity allocation scheme to improve QoE. It is\nshown that an average of 20.1% QoE improvement is achieved by the xURLLC\ncompared to the conventional URLLC with the uniform allocation scheme.

    "abstract": "The Rank Decoding problem (RD) is at the core of rank-based cryptography.\nThis problem can also be seen as a structured version of MinRank, which is\nubiquitous in multivariate cryptography. Recently, \\cite{BBBGNRT20,BBCGPSTV20}\nproposed attacks based on two new algebraic modelings, namely the MaxMinors\nmodeling which is specific to RD and the Support-Minors modeling which applies\nto MinRank in general. Both improved significantly the complexity of algebraic\nattacks on these two problems. In the case of RD and contrarily to what was\nbelieved up to now, these new attacks were shown to be able to outperform\ncombinatorial attacks and this even for very small field sizes.\nHowever, we prove here that the analysis performed in \\cite{BBCGPSTV20} for\none of these attacks which consists in mixing the MaxMinors modeling with the\nSupport-Minors modeling to solve RD is too optimistic and leads to\nunderestimate the overall complexity. This is done by exhibiting linear\ndependencies between these equations and by considering an $\\fqm$ version of\nthese modelings which turns out to be instrumental for getting a better\nunderstanding of both systems. Moreover, by working over $\\Fqm$ rather than\nover $\\ff{q}$, we are able to drastically reduce the number of variables in the\nsystem and we (i) still keep enough algebraic equations to be able to solve the\nsystem, (ii) are able to analyze rigorously the complexity of our approach.\nThis new approach may improve the older MaxMinors approach on RD from\n\\cite{BBBGNRT20,BBCGPSTV20} for certain parameters. We also introduce a new\nhybrid approach on the Support-Minors system whose impact is much more general\nsince it applies to any MinRank problem. This technique improves significantly\nthe complexity of the Support-Minors approach for small to moderate field\nsizes.",

    "abstract": "Due to their extreme long-range modeling capability, vision transformer-based\nnetworks have become increasingly popular in deformable image registration. We\nbelieve, however, that the receptive field of a 5-layer convolutional U-Net is\nsufficient to capture accurate deformations without needing long-range\ndependencies. The purpose of this study is therefore to investigate whether\nU-Net-based methods are outdated compared to modern transformer-based\napproaches when applied to medical image registration. For this, we propose a\nlarge kernel U-Net (LKU-Net) by embedding a parallel convolutional block to a\nvanilla U-Net in order to enhance the effective receptive field. On the public\n3D IXI brain dataset for atlas-based registration, we show that the performance\nof the vanilla U-Net is already comparable with that of state-of-the-art\ntransformer-based networks (such as TransMorph), and that the proposed LKU-Net\noutperforms TransMorph by using only 1.12% of its parameters and 10.8% of its\nmult-adds operations. We further evaluate LKU-Net on a MICCAI Learn2Reg 2021\nchallenge dataset for inter-subject registration, our LKU-Net also outperforms\nTransMorph on this dataset and ranks first on the public leaderboard as of the\nsubmission of this work. With only modest modifications to the vanilla U-Net,\nwe show that U-Net can outperform transformer-based architectures on\ninter-subject and atlas-based 3D medical image registration.

We explore the inherent spatial relationship between LA\nand LA scars. By introducing a Sobel fusion module between the two segmentation\nbranches, the spatial information of LA boundaries can be propagated from the\nLA branch to the scar branch. Thus, LA scar segmentation can be performed\ncondition on the LA boundaries regions.

On a carefully curated SARS-CoV-2 dataset, the\nproposed MATIC model shows advantages comparing with traditional method in\nscreening effective compounds in vivo. Next, we explored the model\ninterpretability and found that the learned features for target inhibition (in\nvitro) or cell active (in vivo) tasks are different with molecular property\ncorrelations and atom functional attentions.

Machine learning has the potential to\nprovide a complexity-friendly LB solution with near-optimal network\nperformance, at the cost of a training process. The state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nlearning-aided LB methods, however, need retraining when the network\nenvironment (especially the number of users) changes, significantly limiting\nits practicability. In this paper, a novel deep neural network (DNN) structure\nnamed adaptive target-condition neural network (A-TCNN) is proposed, which\nconducts AP selection for one target user upon the condition of other users.\nAlso, an adaptive mechanism is developed to map a smaller number of users to a\nlarger number through splitting their data rate requirements, without affecting\nthe AP selection result for the target user. This enables the proposed method\nto handle different numbers of users without the need for retraining. Results\nshow that A-TCNN achieves a network throughput very close to that of the\ntesting dataset, with a gap less than 3%. It is also proven that A-TCNN can\nobtain a network throughput comparable to two SOTA benchmarks, while reducing\nthe runtime by up to three orders of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Reverberations are unavoidable in enclosures, resulting in reduced\nintelligibility for hearing impaired and non native listeners and even for the\nnormal hearing listeners in noisy circumstances. It also degrades the\nperformance of machine listening applications. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel approach of binaural dereverberation of a single speech source, using the\ndifferences in the interaural cues of the direct path signal and the\nreverberations. Two beamformers, spaced at an interaural distance, are used to\nextract the reverberations from the reverberant speech. The interaural cues\ngenerated by these reverberations and those generated by the direct path signal\nact as a two class dataset, used for the training of U-Net (a deep\nconvolutional neural network). After its training, the beamformers are removed\nand the trained U-Net along with the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)\nalgorithm is used to discriminate between the direct path cues from the\nreverberation cues, when the system is exposed to the interaural spectrogram of\nthe reverberant speech signal. Our proposed model has outperformed the\nclassical signal processing dereverberation model weighted prediction error in\nterms of cepstral distance (CEP), frequency weighted segmental signal to noise\nratio (FWSEGSNR) and signal to reverberation modulation energy ratio (SRMR) by\n1.4 points, 8 dB and 0.6dB. It has achieved better performance than the deep\nlearning based dereverberation model by gaining 1.3 points improvement in CEP\nwith comparable FWSEGSNR, using training dataset which is almost 8 times\nsmaller than required for that model. The proposed model also sustained its\nperformance under relatively similar unseen acoustic conditions and at\npositions in the vicinity of its training position.",

    "abstract": "Motion is a typical reaction among animals and humans trying to reach better\nconditions in a changing world. This aspect has been studied intensively in\nsocial dilemmas where competing players' individual and collective interests\nare in conflict. Starting from the traditional public goods game model, where\nplayers are locally fixed and unconditional cooperators or defectors are\npresent, we introduce two additional strategies through which agents can change\ntheir positions of dependence on the local cooperation level. More importantly,\nthese so-called sophisticated players should bear an extra cost to maintain\ntheir permanent capacity to evaluate their neighborhood and react accordingly.\nHence, four strategies compete, and the most successful one can be imitated by\nits neighbors. Crucially, the introduction of costly movement has a highly\nbiased consequence on the competing main strategies. In the majority of\nparameter space, it is harmful to defectors and provides a significantly higher\ncooperation level when the population is rare. At an intermediate population\ndensity, which would be otherwise optimal for a system of immobile players, the\npresence of mobile actors could be detrimental if the interaction pattern\nchanges slightly, thereby blocking the optimal percolation of information flow.\nIn this parameter space, sophisticated cooperators can also show the co-called\nMoor effect by first avoiding the harmful vicinity of defectors; they\nsubsequentially transform into an immobile cooperator state. Hence,\nparadoxically, the additional cost of movement could be advantageous to reach a\nhigher general income, especially for a rare population when subgroups would be\nisolated otherwise.",

Moreover, as per the Peukert effect, we consider\npragmatic non-linear battery discharge for the battery of the UAV. Thus, we\nformulate the problem in a novel manner that represents the maximization of a\nfairness-based energy efficiency metric and is named fair energy efficiency\n(FEE). The FEE metric defines a system that lays importance on both the\nper-user service fairness and the energy efficiency of the PAP. The formulated\nproblem takes the form of a non-convex problem with non-tractable constraints.\nTo obtain a solution, we represent the problem as a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP) with continuous state and action spaces. Considering the complexity of\nthe solution space, we use the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient\n(TD3) actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to learn a\npolicy that maximizes the FEE of the system. We perform two types of RL\ntraining to exhibit the effectiveness of our approach: the first (offline)\napproach keeps the positions of the GNs the same throughout the training phase;\nthe second approach generalizes the learned policy to any arrangement of GNs by\nchanging the positions of GNs after each training episode. Numerical\nevaluations show that neglecting the Peukert effect overestimates the air-time\nof the PAP and can be addressed by optimally selecting the PAP's flying speed.\nMoreover, the user fairness, energy efficiency, and hence the FEE value of the\nsystem can be improved by efficiently moving the PAP above the GNs. As such, we\nnotice massive FEE improvements over baseline scenarios of up to 88.31%,\n272.34%, and 318.13% for suburban, urban, and dense urban environments,\nrespectively.",

Medical imaging supports multiple modalities of data that\nenable a thorough and quick look inside a human body. However, interpreting\nimaging data is often time-consuming and requires a great deal of human\nexpertise. Deep learning models can expedite interpretation and alleviate the\nwork of human experts. However, these models are data-intensive and require\nsignificant labeled images for training. During novel disease outbreaks such as\nCovid-19, we often do not have the required labeled imaging data, especially at\nthe start of the epidemic. Deep Transfer Learning addresses this problem by\nusing a pretrained model in the public domain, e.g. any variant of either\nVGGNet, ResNet, Inception, DenseNet, etc., as a feature learner to quickly\nadapt the target task from fewer samples. Most pretrained models are deep with\ncomplex architectures. They are trained with large multi-class datasets such as\nImageNet, with significant human efforts in architecture design and hyper\nparameters tuning. We presented 1 a simpler generative source model, pretrained\non a single but related concept, can perform as effectively as existing larger\npretrained models. We demonstrate the usefulness of generative transfer\nlearning that requires less compute and training data, for Few Shot Learning\n(FSL) with a Covid-19 binary classification use case.

Systematic diversification protocols\nare needed. Here we propose to use an unsupervised machine learning model known\nas the Potts model to discover new, useful sequences with controllable sequence\ndiversity. We start by training a Potts model using the maximum entropy\nprinciple on a small set of empirically identified sequences unified by a\ncommon feature. To generate new candidate sequences with a controllable degree\nof diversity, we take advantage of the model's spectral feature: an energy\nbandgap separating sequences that are similar to the training set from those\nthat are distinct. By controlling the Potts energy range that is sampled, we\ngenerate sequences that are distinct from the training set yet still likely to\nhave the encoded features.

One of the most successful methods is contrastive self-supervised\nmethods, which require negative sampling: sampling alternative samples to\ncontrast with the current sample (anchor). However, it is hard to ensure if all\nthe negative samples belong to classes different from the anchor class without\nlabels. This paper applies a non-contrastive self-supervised learning method on\nan unlabeled speech corpus to learn utterance-level embeddings. We used\nDIstillation with NO labels (DINO), proposed in computer vision, and adapted it\nto the speech domain. Unlike the contrastive methods, DINO does not require\nnegative sampling. These embeddings were evaluated on speaker verification and\nemotion recognition. In speaker verification, the unsupervised DINO embedding\nwith cosine scoring provided 4.38% EER on the VoxCeleb1 test trial. This\noutperforms the best contrastive self-supervised method by 40% relative in EER.\nAn iterative pseudo-labeling training pipeline, not requiring speaker labels,\nfurther improved the EER to 1.89%.

    "title": "Detecting COVID-19 from digitized ECG printouts using 1D convolutional  neural networks",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of healthcare services\nworldwide, raising the need to develop novel tools to provide rapid and\ncost-effective screening and diagnosis. Clinical reports indicated that\nCOVID-19 infection may cause cardiac injury, and electrocardiograms (ECG) may\nserve as a diagnostic biomarker for COVID-19. This study aims to utilize ECG\nsignals to detect COVID-19 automatically. We propose a novel method to extract\nECG signals from ECG paper records, which are then fed into a one-dimensional\nconvolution neural network (1D-CNN) to learn and diagnose the disease. To\nevaluate the quality of digitized signals, R peaks in the paper-based ECG\nimages are labeled. Afterward, RR intervals calculated from each image are\ncompared to RR intervals of the corresponding digitized signal. Experiments on\nthe COVID-19 ECG images dataset demonstrate that the proposed digitization\nmethod is able to capture correctly the original signals, with a mean absolute\nerror of 28.11 ms. Our proposed 1D-CNN model, which is trained on the digitized\nECG signals, allows identifying individuals with COVID-19 and other subjects\naccurately, with classification accuracies of 98.42%, 95.63%, and 98.50% for\nclassifying COVID-19 vs. Normal, COVID-19 vs. Abnormal Heartbeats, and COVID-19\nvs. other classes, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method also achieves\na high-level of performance for the multi-classification task. Our findings\nindicate that a deep learning system trained on digitized ECG signals can serve\nas a potential tool for diagnosing COVID-19.",

    "title": "Rapid Exploration of a 32.5M Compound Chemical Space with Active  Learning to Discover Density Functional Approximation Insensitive and  Synthetically Accessible Transitional Metal Chromophores",
    "abstract": "Two outstanding challenges for machine learning (ML) accelerated chemical\ndiscovery are the synthesizability of candidate molecules or materials and the\nfidelity of the data used in ML model training. To address the first challenge,\nwe construct a hypothetical design space of 32.5M transition metal complexes\n(TMCs), in which all of the constituent fragments (i.e., metals and ligands)\nand ligand symmetries are synthetically accessible. To address the second\nchallenge, we search for consensus in predictions among 23 density functional\napproximations across multiple rungs of Jacob's ladder. To accelerate the\nscreening of these 32.5M TMCs, we use efficient global optimization to sample\ncandidate low-spin chromophores that simultaneously have low absorption\nenergies and low static correlation. Despite the scarcity (i.e., $<$ 0.01\\%) of\npotential chromophores in this large chemical space, we identify transition\nmetal chromophores with high likelihood (i.e., $>$ 10\\%) as the ML models\nimprove during active learning. This represents a 1,000 fold acceleration in\ndiscovery corresponding to discoveries in days instead of years. Analyses of\ncandidate chromophores reveal a preference for Co(III) and large, strong-field\nligands with more bond saturation. We compute the absorption spectra of\npromising chromophores on the Pareto front by time-dependent density functional\ntheory calculations and verify that two thirds of them have desired excited\nstate properties. Although these complexes have never been experimentally\nexplored, their constituent ligands demonstrated interesting optical properties\nin literature, exemplifying the effectiveness of our construction of realistic\nTMC design space and active learning approach.",

    "title": "Non-Contrastive Self-supervised Learning for Utterance-Level Information  Extraction from Speech",
    "abstract": "In recent studies, self-supervised pre-trained models tend to outperform\nsupervised pre-trained models in transfer learning. In particular,\nself-supervised learning (SSL) of utterance-level speech representation can be\nused in speech applications that require discriminative representation of\nconsistent attributes within an utterance: speaker, language, emotion, and age.\nExisting frame-level self-supervised speech representation, e.g., wav2vec, can\nbe used as utterance-level representation with pooling, but the models are\nusually large. There are also SSL techniques to learn utterance-level\nrepresentation. One of the most successful is a contrastive method, which\nrequires negative sampling: selecting alternative samples to contrast with the\ncurrent sample (anchor). However, this does not ensure that all the negative\nsamples belong to classes different from the anchor class without labels. This\npaper applies a non-contrastive self-supervised method to learn utterance-level\nembeddings. We adapted DIstillation with NO labels (DINO) from computer vision\nto speech. Unlike contrastive methods, DINO does not require negative sampling.\nWe compared DINO to x-vector trained in a supervised manner. When transferred\nto down-stream tasks (speaker verification, speech emotion recognition (SER),\nand Alzheimer's disease detection), DINO outperformed x-vector. We studied the\ninfluence of several aspects during transfer learning such as dividing the\nfine-tuning process into steps, chunk lengths, or augmentation. During\nfine-tuning, tuning the last affine layers first and then the whole network\nsurpassed fine-tuning all at once. Using shorter chunk lengths, although they\ngenerate more diverse inputs, did not necessarily improve performance, implying\nspeech segments at least with a specific length are required for better\nperformance per application. Augmentation was helpful in SER.",

    "abstract": "We propose statistically robust and computationally efficient linear learning\nmethods in the high-dimensional batch setting, where the number of features $d$\nmay exceed the sample size $n$. We employ, in a generic learning setting, two\nalgorithms depending on whether the considered loss function is\ngradient-Lipschitz or not. Then, we instantiate our framework on several\napplications including vanilla sparse, group-sparse and low-rank matrix\nrecovery. This leads, for each application, to efficient and robust learning\nalgorithms, that reach near-optimal estimation rates under heavy-tailed\ndistributions and the presence of outliers. For vanilla $s$-sparsity, we are\nable to reach the $s\\log (d)/n$ rate under heavy-tails and $\\eta$-corruption,\nat a computational cost comparable to that of non-robust analogs. We provide an\nefficient implementation of our algorithms in an open-source $\\mathtt{Python}$\nlibrary called $\\mathtt{linlearn}$, by means of which we carry out numerical\nexperiments which confirm our theoretical findings together with a comparison\nto other recent approaches proposed in the literature.",
