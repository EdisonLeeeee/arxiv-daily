    "title": "Augmenting Reinforcement Learning with Transformer-based Scene  Representation Learning for Decision-making of Autonomous Driving",
    "abstract": "Decision-making for urban autonomous driving is challenging due to the\nstochastic nature of interactive traffic participants and the complexity of\nroad structures. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based decision-making\nscheme is promising to handle urban driving scenarios, it suffers from low\nsample efficiency and poor adaptability. In this paper, we propose Scene-Rep\nTransformer to improve the RL decision-making capabilities with better scene\nrepresentation encoding and sequential predictive latent distillation.\nSpecifically, a multi-stage Transformer (MST) encoder is constructed to model\nnot only the interaction awareness between the ego vehicle and its neighbors\nbut also intention awareness between the agents and their candidate routes. A\nsequential latent Transformer (SLT) with self-supervised learning objectives is\nemployed to distill the future predictive information into the latent scene\nrepresentation, in order to reduce the exploration space and speed up training.\nThe final decision-making module based on soft actor-critic (SAC) takes as\ninput the refined latent scene representation from the Scene-Rep Transformer\nand outputs driving actions. The framework is validated in five challenging\nsimulated urban scenarios with dense traffic, and its performance is manifested\nquantitatively by the substantial improvements in data efficiency and\nperformance in terms of success rate, safety, and efficiency. The qualitative\nresults reveal that our framework is able to extract the intentions of neighbor\nagents to help make decisions and deliver more diversified driving behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Log and square root transformations of target variable are routinely used in\nforecasting models to predict future sales. These transformations often lead to\nbetter performing models. However, they also introduce a systematic negative\nbias (under-forecasting). In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of this\nbias, dive deep into its root cause and introduce two methods to correct for\nthe bias. We conclude that the proposed bias correction methods improve model\nperformance (by up to 50%) and make a case for incorporating bias correction in\nmodeling workflow.\nWe also experiment with `Tweedie' family of cost functions which circumvents\nthe transformation bias issue by modeling directly on sales. We conclude that\nTweedie regression gives the best performance so far when modeling on sales\nmaking it a strong alternative to working with a transformed target variable.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has enabled global model training on decentralized\ndata in a privacy-preserving way by aggregating model updates. However, for\nmany natural language processing (NLP) tasks that utilize pre-trained language\nmodels (PLMs) with large numbers of parameters, there are considerable\ncommunication costs associated with FL. Recently, prompt tuning, which tunes\nsome soft prompts without modifying PLMs, has achieved excellent performance as\na new learning paradigm. Therefore we want to combine the two methods and\nexplore the effect of prompt tuning under FL. In this paper, we propose\n\"FedPrompt\" as the first work study prompt tuning in a model split learning way\nusing FL, and prove that split learning greatly reduces the communication cost,\nonly 0.01% of the PLMs' parameters, with little decrease on accuracy both on\nIID and Non-IID data distribution. This improves the efficiency of FL method\nwhile also protecting the data privacy in prompt tuning.In addition, like PLMs,\nprompts are uploaded and downloaded between public platforms and personal\nusers, so we try to figure out whether there is still a backdoor threat using\nonly soft prompt in FL scenarios. We further conduct backdoor attacks by data\npoisoning on FedPrompt. Our experiments show that normal backdoor attack can\nnot achieve a high attack success rate, proving the robustness of FedPrompt.We\nhope this work can promote the application of prompt in FL and raise the\nawareness of the possible security threats.",

To further improve the robustness, we\nintroduce a periodicity proposal module to search and use multiple candidate\nperiodicities in our pipeline.

    "abstract": "Inverter-based resources (IBR) have been widely studied for their advantages\non the current power systems. This increase in the penetration of renewable\nenergy has raised some concerns about the stability of the existing grid.\nHistorically, power systems are dominated by synchronous generators that can\neasily react to system instability due to high inertia and damping\ncharacteristics. However, with IBR, the control of the inverter plays a crucial\nrole in contributing to the system stability and enhancing the functionality of\nthe inverters. One of these novel control methods is droop control. Droop\ncharacteristics are used to control voltage, frequency, and active and reactive\npower. This paper presents the impact of frequency droop damping on system\nfrequency, real power, and the rate of change of frequency with distributed\nenergy resources. Also, battery sizing is suggested based on the results. The\nresults also show the need for optimal selection for the frequency droop\ndamping to fulfill the appropriate battery size in terms of cost and\nperformance.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems (RS) mediate human experience online. Most RS act to\noptimize metrics that are imperfectly aligned with the best-interest of users\nbut are easy to measure, like ad-clicks and user engagement. This has resulted\nin a host of hard-to-measure side-effects: political polarization, addiction,\nfake news. RS design faces a recommender alignment problem: that of aligning\nrecommendations with the goals of users, system designers, and society as a\nwhole. But how do we test and compare potential solutions to align RS? Their\nmassive scale makes them costly and risky to test in deployment. We synthesized\na simple abstract modelling framework to guide future work.\nTo illustrate it, we construct a toy experiment where we ask: \"How can we\nevaluate the consequences of using user retention as a reward function?\" To\nanswer the question, we learn recommender policies that optimize reward\nfunctions by controlling graph dynamics on a toy environment. Based on the\neffects that trained recommenders have on their environment, we conclude that\nengagement maximizers generally lead to worse outcomes than aligned\nrecommenders but not always. After learning, we examine competition between RS\nas a potential solution to RS alignment. We find that it generally makes our\ntoy-society better-off than it would be under the absence of recommendation or\nengagement maximizers.\nIn this work, we aimed for a broad scope, touching superficially on many\ndifferent points to shed light on how an end-to-end study of reward functions\nfor recommender systems might be done. Recommender alignment is a pressing and\nimportant problem.

    "abstract": "Image editing and compositing have become ubiquitous in entertainment, from\ndigital art to AR and VR experiences. To produce beautiful composites, the\ncamera needs to be geometrically calibrated, which can be tedious and requires\na physical calibration target. In place of the traditional multi-images\ncalibration process, we propose to infer the camera calibration parameters such\nas pitch, roll, field of view, and lens distortion directly from a single image\nusing a deep convolutional neural network. We train this network using\nautomatically generated samples from a large-scale panorama dataset, yielding\ncompetitive accuracy in terms of standard l2 error. However, we argue that\nminimizing such standard error metrics might not be optimal for many\napplications. In this work, we investigate human sensitivity to inaccuracies in\ngeometric camera calibration. To this end, we conduct a large-scale human\nperception study where we ask participants to judge the realism of 3D objects\ncomposited with correct and biased camera calibration parameters. Based on this\nstudy, we develop a new perceptual measure for camera calibration and\ndemonstrate that our deep calibration network outperforms previous single-image\nbased calibration methods both on standard metrics as well as on this novel\nperceptual measure. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our calibration network\nfor several applications, including virtual object insertion, image retrieval,\nand compositing.

    "abstract": "Most data analytical pipelines often encounter the problem of querying\ninconsistent data that violate pre-determined integrity constraints. Data\ncleaning is an extensively studied paradigm that singles out a consistent\nrepair of the inconsistent data. Consistent query answering (CQA) is an\nalternative approach to data cleaning that asks for all tuples guaranteed to be\nreturned by a given query on all (in most cases, exponentially many) repairs of\nthe inconsistent data. This paper identifies a class of acyclic\nselect-project-join (SPJ) queries for which CQA can be solved via SQL rewriting\nwith a linear time guarantee. Our rewriting method can be viewed as a\ngeneralization of Yannakakis's algorithm for acyclic joins to the inconsistent\nsetting. We present LinCQA, a system that can output rewritings in both SQL and\nnon-recursive Datalog rules for every query in this class. We show that LinCQA\noften outperforms the existing CQA systems on both synthetic and real-world\nworkloads, and in some cases, by orders of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Flying and ground-based cars require various services such as autonomous\ndriving, remote pilot, infotainment, and remote diagnosis. Each service\nrequires specific Quality of Service (QoS) and network features. Therefore,\nnetwork slicing can be a solution to fulfill the requirements of various\nservices. Some services, such as infotainment, may have similar requirements to\nserve flying and ground-based cars. Therefore, some slices can serve both kinds\nof cars. However, when network slice resource sharing is too aggressive, slices\ncan not meet QoS requirements, where resource under-provisioning causes the\nviolation of QoS, and resource over-provisioning causes resource\nunder-utilization. We propose two closed loops for managing RAN slice resources\nfor cars to address these challenges. First, we present an auction mechanism\nfor allocating Resource Block (RB) to the tenants who provide services to the\ncars using slices. Second, we design one closed loop that maps slices and\nservices of tenants to virtual Open Distributed Units (vO-DUs) and assigns RB\nto vO-DUs for management purposes. Third, we design another closed loop for\nintra-slices RB scheduling to serve cars. Fourth, we present a reward function\nthat interconnects these two closed loops to satisfy the time-varying demands\nof cars at each slice while meeting QoS requirements in terms of delay.\nFinally, we design distributed deep reinforcement learning approach to maximize\nthe formulated reward function. The simulation results show that our approach\nsatisfies more than 90% vO-DUs resource constraints and network slice\nrequirements.",

As opposed to third-party cookies, outright first-party\ncookie blocking is not practical because it would result in major breakage of\nlegitimate website functionality.\nWe propose CookieGraph, a machine learning approach that can accurately and\nrobustly detect first-party tracking cookies. CookieGraph detects first-party\ntracking cookies with 91.06% accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art\nCookieBlock approach by 10.28%. We show that CookieGraph is fully robust\nagainst cookie name manipulation while CookieBlock's accuracy drops by 15.68%.\nWe also show that CookieGraph does not cause any major breakage while\nCookieBlock causes major breakage on 8% of the websites with SSO logins. Our\ndeployment of CookieGraph shows that first-party tracking cookies are used on\n93.43% of the 10K websites. We also find that the most prevalent first-party\ntracking cookies are set by major advertising entities such as Google as well\nas many specialized entities such as Criteo.",

Usually, it is\nformulated as a metric learning problem. The core issue of few-shot\nclassification is how to learn (1) consistent representations for images in\nboth support and query sets and (2) effective metric learning for images\nbetween support and query sets. In this paper, we show that the two challenges\ncan be well modeled simultaneously via a unified Query-Support TransFormer\n(QSFormer) model. To be specific,the proposed QSFormer involves global\nquery-support sample Transformer (sampleFormer) branch and local patch\nTransformer (patchFormer) learning branch. sampleFormer aims to capture the\ndependence of samples in support and query sets for image representation. It\nadopts the Encoder, Decoder and Cross-Attention to respectively model the\nSupport, Query (image) representation and Metric learning for few-shot\nclassification task. Also, as a complementary to global learning branch, we\nadopt a local patch Transformer to extract structural representation for each\nimage sample by capturing the long-range dependence of local image patches. In\naddition, a novel Cross-scale Interactive Feature Extractor (CIFE) is proposed\nto extract and fuse multi-scale CNN features as an effective backbone module\nfor the proposed few-shot learning method.

    "abstract": "Simulation is the key to scaling up validation and verification for robotic\nsystems such as autonomous vehicles. Despite advances in high-fidelity physics\nand sensor simulation, a critical gap remains in simulating realistic behaviors\nof road users. This is because, unlike simulating physics and graphics,\ndevising first principle models for human-like behaviors is generally\ninfeasible. In this work, we take a data-driven approach and propose a method\nthat can learn to generate traffic behaviors from real-world driving logs. The\nmethod achieves high sample efficiency and behavior diversity by exploiting the\nbi-level hierarchy of driving behaviors by decoupling the traffic simulation\nproblem into high-level intent inference and low-level driving behavior\nimitation. The method also incorporates a planning module to obtain stable\nlong-horizon behaviors. We empirically validate our method, named Bi-level\nImitation for Traffic Simulation (BITS), with scenarios from two large-scale\ndriving datasets and show that BITS achieves balanced traffic simulation\nperformance in realism, diversity, and long-horizon stability. We also explore\nways to evaluate behavior realism and introduce a suite of evaluation metrics\nfor traffic simulation. Finally, as part of our core contributions, we develop\nand open source a software tool that unifies data formats across different\ndriving datasets and converts scenes from existing datasets into interactive\nsimulation environments.

    "abstract": "Latent space exploration is a technique that discovers interpretable latent\ndirections and manipulates latent codes to edit various attributes in images\ngenerated by generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, in previous work,\nspatial control is limited to simple transformations (e.g., translation and\nrotation), and it is laborious to identify appropriate latent directions and\nadjust their parameters. In this paper, we tackle the problem of editing the\nStyleGAN image layout by annotating the image directly. To do so, we propose an\ninteractive framework for manipulating latent codes in accordance with the user\ninputs. In our framework, the user annotates a StyleGAN image with locations\nthey want to move or not and specifies a movement direction by mouse dragging.\nFrom these user inputs and initial latent codes, our latent transformer based\non a transformer encoder-decoder architecture estimates the output latent\ncodes, which are fed to the StyleGAN generator to obtain a result image. To\ntrain our latent transformer, we utilize synthetic data and pseudo-user inputs\ngenerated by off-the-shelf StyleGAN and optical flow models, without manual\nsupervision. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method over existing methods.",

    "title": "Leveraging Symmetrical Convolutional Transformer Networks for Speech to  Singing Voice Style Transfer",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a model to perform style transfer of speech to\nsinging voice. Contrary to the previous signal processing-based methods, which\nrequire high-quality singing templates or phoneme synchronization, we explore a\ndata-driven approach for the problem of converting natural speech to singing\nvoice. We develop a novel neural network architecture, called SymNet, which\nmodels the alignment of the input speech with the target melody while\npreserving the speaker identity and naturalness. The proposed SymNet model is\ncomprised of symmetrical stack of three types of layers - convolutional,\ntransformer, and self-attention layers. The paper also explores novel data\naugmentation and generative loss annealing methods to facilitate the model\ntraining. Experiments are performed on the\nNUS and NHSS datasets which consist of parallel data of speech and singing\nvoice. In these experiments, we show that the proposed SymNet model improves\nthe objective reconstruction quality significantly over the previously\npublished methods and baseline architectures. Further, a subjective listening\ntest confirms the improved quality of the audio obtained using the proposed\napproach (absolute improvement of 0.37 in mean opinion score measure over the\nbaseline system).",

    "abstract": "Arbitrary shape text detection is a challenging task due to the significantly\nvaried sizes and aspect ratios, arbitrary orientations or shapes, inaccurate\nannotations, etc. Due to the scalability of pixel-level prediction,\nsegmentation-based methods can adapt to various shape texts and hence attracted\nconsiderable attention recently. However, accurate pixel-level annotations of\ntexts are formidable, and the existing datasets for scene text detection only\nprovide coarse-grained boundary annotations. Consequently, numerous\nmisclassified text pixels or background pixels inside annotations always exist,\ndegrading the performance of segmentation-based text detection methods.\nGenerally speaking, whether a pixel belongs to text or not is highly related to\nthe distance with the adjacent annotation boundary. With this observation, in\nthis paper, we propose an innovative and robust segmentation-based detection\nmethod via probability maps for accurately detecting text instances. To be\nconcrete, we adopt a Sigmoid Alpha Function (SAF) to transfer the distances\nbetween boundaries and their inside pixels to a probability map. However, one\nprobability map can not cover complex probability distributions well because of\nthe uncertainty of coarse-grained text boundary annotations. Therefore, we\nadopt a group of probability maps computed by a series of Sigmoid Alpha\nFunctions to describe the possible probability distributions. In addition, we\npropose an iterative model to learn to predict and assimilate probability maps\nfor providing enough information to reconstruct text instances. Finally, simple\nregion growth algorithms are adopted to aggregate probability maps to complete\ntext instances. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in terms of detection accuracy on several\nbenchmarks.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that the success of graph neural networks (GNNs) highly\nrelies on abundant human-annotated data, which is laborious to obtain and not\nalways available in practice. When only few labeled nodes are available, how to\ndevelop highly effective GNNs remains understudied. Though self-training has\nbeen shown to be powerful for semi-supervised learning, its application on\ngraph-structured data may fail because (1) larger receptive fields are not\nleveraged to capture long-range node interactions, which exacerbates the\ndifficulty of propagating feature-label patterns from labeled nodes to\nunlabeled nodes; and (2) limited labeled data makes it challenging to learn\nwell-separated decision boundaries for different node classes without\nexplicitly capturing the underlying semantic structure. To address the\nchallenges of capturing informative structural and semantic knowledge, we\npropose a new graph data augmentation framework, AGST (Augmented Graph\nSelf-Training), which is built with two new (i.e., structural and semantic)\naugmentation modules on top of a decoupled GST backbone.

This is especially seen in medical domains\nwhere dense pixel-level annotations are expensive to obtain. In this paper, we\npropose Regularized Prototypical Neural Ordinary Differential Equation\n(R-PNODE), a method that leverages intrinsic properties of Neural-ODEs,\nassisted and enhanced by additional cluster and consistency losses to perform\nFew-Shot Segmentation (FSS) of organs.

We further demonstrate that while many\nexisting Deep CNN based methods tend to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks, R-PNODE exhibits increased adversarial robustness for a wide array of\nthese attacks. We experiment with three publicly available multi-organ\nsegmentation datasets in both in-domain and cross-domain FSS settings to\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our method.

    "abstract": "Imbalanced learning is a fundamental challenge in data mining, where there is\na disproportionate ratio of training samples in each class. Over-sampling is an\neffective technique to tackle imbalanced learning through generating synthetic\nsamples for the minority class. While numerous over-sampling algorithms have\nbeen proposed, they heavily rely on heuristics, which could be sub-optimal\nsince we may need different sampling strategies for different datasets and base\nclassifiers, and they cannot directly optimize the performance metric.\nMotivated by this, we investigate developing a learning-based over-sampling\nalgorithm to optimize the classification performance, which is a challenging\ntask because of the huge and hierarchical decision space. At the high level, we\nneed to decide how many synthetic samples to generate. At the low level, we\nneed to determine where the synthetic samples should be located, which depends\non the high-level decision since the optimal locations of the samples may\ndiffer for different numbers of samples. To address the challenges, we propose\nAutoSMOTE, an automated over-sampling algorithm that can jointly optimize\ndifferent levels of decisions. Motivated by the success of\nSMOTE~\\cite{chawla2002smote} and its extensions, we formulate the generation\nprocess as a Markov decision process (MDP) consisting of three levels of\npolicies to generate synthetic samples within the SMOTE search space.

However, an inescapable problem of high utility\nitemset mining is that its discovered results hide the quantities of patterns,\nwhich causes poor interpretability. The results only reflect the shopping\ntrends of customers, which cannot help decision makers quantify collected\ninformation. In linguistic terms, computers use mathematical or programming\nlanguages that are precisely formalized, but the language used by humans is\nalways ambiguous. In this paper, we propose a novel one-phase temporal fuzzy\nutility itemset mining approach called TFUM. It revises temporal fuzzy-lists to\nmaintain less but major information about potential high temporal fuzzy utility\nitemsets in memory, and then discovers a complete set of real interesting\npatterns in a short time. In particular, the remaining measure is the first\nadopted in the temporal fuzzy utility itemset mining domain in this paper. The\nremaining maximal temporal fuzzy utility is a tighter and stronger upper bound\nthan that of previous studies adopted. Hence, it plays an important role in\npruning the search space in TFUM. Finally, we also evaluate the efficiency and\neffectiveness of TFUM on various datasets.

Previous works target logistics and delivery-related solutions\nwherein a homogeneous fleet of commercial EVs have to return to the initial\npoint after making multiple stops. On the opposing front, we solve a personal\nelectric vehicle routing problem and provide an optimal route for a single\nvehicle in a long origin-destination (OD) trip.

In addition, we incorporate external and real-life elements like\ntraffic at charging stations, detour distances for reaching a charging station,\nand variable costs of electricity at different charging stations into the\nproblem formulation. In particular, we define a multi-objective mixed integer\nnon-linear programming (MINLP) problem and obtain a feasible solution using the\n$\\epsilon$-constraint algorithm.

    "abstract": "In 3D action recognition, there exists rich complementary information between\nskeleton modalities. Nevertheless, how to model and utilize this information\nremains a challenging problem for self-supervised 3D action representation\nlearning.

Different from classic\ndistillation solutions that transfer the knowledge of a fixed and pre-trained\nteacher to the student, in this work, the knowledge is continuously updated and\nbidirectionally distilled between modalities. To this end, we propose a new\nCross-modal Mutual Distillation (CMD) framework with the following designs. On\nthe one hand, the neighboring similarity distribution is introduced to model\nthe knowledge learned in each modality, where the relational information is\nnaturally suitable for the contrastive frameworks. On the other hand,\nasymmetrical configurations are used for teacher and student to stabilize the\ndistillation process and to transfer high-confidence information between\nmodalities.

    "abstract": "Recently, data collaboration (DC) analysis has been developed for\nprivacy-preserving integrated analysis across multiple institutions. DC\nanalysis centralizes individually constructed dimensionality-reduced\nintermediate representations and realizes integrated analysis via collaboration\nrepresentations without sharing the original data. To construct the\ncollaboration representations, each institution generates and shares a\nshareable anchor dataset and centralizes its intermediate representation.\nAlthough, random anchor dataset functions well for DC analysis in general,\nusing an anchor dataset whose distribution is close to that of the raw dataset\nis expected to improve the recognition performance, particularly for the\ninterpretable DC analysis. Based on an extension of the synthetic minority\nover-sampling technique (SMOTE), this study proposes an anchor data\nconstruction technique to improve the recognition performance without\nincreasing the risk of data leakage. Numerical results demonstrate the\nefficiency of the proposed SMOTE-based method over the existing anchor data\nconstructions for artificial and real-world datasets. Specifically, the\nproposed method achieves 9 percentage point and 38 percentage point performance\nimprovements regarding accuracy and essential feature selection, respectively,\nover existing methods for an income dataset. The proposed method provides\nanother use of SMOTE not for imbalanced data classifications but for a key\ntechnology of privacy-preserving integrated analysis.",

    "title": "Meta Objective Guided Disambiguation for Partial Label Learning",
    "abstract": "Partial label learning (PLL) is a typical weakly supervised learning\nframework, where each training instance is associated with a candidate label\nset, among which only one label is valid. To solve PLL problems, typically\nmethods try to perform disambiguation for candidate sets by either using prior\nknowledge, such as structure information of training data, or refining model\noutputs in a self-training manner. Unfortunately, these methods often fail to\nobtain a favorable performance due to the lack of prior information or\nunreliable predictions in the early stage of model training. In this paper, we\npropose a novel framework for partial label learning with meta objective guided\ndisambiguation (MoGD), which aims to recover the ground-truth label from\ncandidate labels set by solving a meta objective on a small validation set.\nSpecifically, to alleviate the negative impact of false positive labels, we\nre-weight each candidate label based on the meta loss on the validation set.\nThen, the classifier is trained by minimizing the weighted cross entropy loss.\nThe proposed method can be easily implemented by using various deep networks\nwith the ordinary SGD optimizer. Theoretically, we prove the convergence\nproperty of meta objective and derive the estimation error bounds of the\nproposed method. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and\nreal-world PLL datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve\ncompetent performance when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the task of knowledge-based question generation\n(KBQG). Conventional KBQG works generated questions from fact triples in the\nknowledge graph, which could not express complex operations like aggregation\nand comparison in SPARQL. Moreover, due to the costly annotation of large-scale\nSPARQL-question pairs, KBQG from SPARQL under low-resource scenarios urgently\nneeds to be explored. Recently, since the generative pre-trained language\nmodels (PLMs) typically trained in natural language (NL)-to-NL paradigm have\nbeen proven effective for low-resource generation, e.g., T5 and BART, how to\neffectively utilize them to generate NL-question from non-NL SPARQL is\nchallenging. To address these challenges, AutoQGS, an auto-prompt approach for\nlow-resource KBQG from SPARQL, is proposed. Firstly, we put forward to generate\nquestions directly from SPARQL for the KBQG task to handle complex operations.\nSecondly, we propose an auto-prompter trained on large-scale unsupervised data\nto rephrase SPARQL into NL description, smoothing the low-resource\ntransformation from non-NL SPARQL to NL question with PLMs. Experimental\nresults on the WebQuestionsSP, ComlexWebQuestions 1.1, and PathQuestions show\nthat our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in\nlow-resource settings.

    "abstract": "Network alignment task, which aims to identify corresponding nodes in\ndifferent networks, is of great significance for many subsequent applications.\nWithout the need for labeled anchor links, unsupervised alignment methods have\nbeen attracting more and more attention. However, the topological consistency\nassumptions defined by existing methods are generally low-order and less\naccurate because only the edge-indiscriminative topological pattern is\nconsidered, which is especially risky in an unsupervised setting. To reposition\nthe focus of the alignment process from low-order to higher-order topological\nconsistency, in this paper, we propose a fully unsupervised network alignment\nframework named HTC. The proposed higher-order topological consistency is\nformulated based on edge orbits, which is merged into the information\naggregation process of a graph convolutional network so that the alignment\nconsistencies are transformed into the similarity of node embeddings.\nFurthermore, the encoder is trained to be multi-orbit-aware and then be refined\nto identify more trusted anchor links. Node correspondence is comprehensively\nevaluated by integrating all different orders of consistency. {In addition to\nsound theoretical analysis, the superiority of the proposed method is also\nempirically demonstrated through extensive experimental evaluation. On three\npairs of real-world datasets and two pairs of synthetic datasets, our HTC\nconsistently outperforms a wide variety of unsupervised and supervised methods\nwith the least or comparable time consumption.

To cope with the first difficulty, we apply\nobject-wise image mixing to generate new training samples for maximally\ncovering distributed patterns of objects in the target domain.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been\nused to reduce the problem to the supervised setting with the advantage that\nsupervised learning has state-of-the-art accuracy in classification tasks. In\norder to generate \\textit{pseudo}-negative observations, GANs are trained on\npositive and unlabeled observations with a modified loss. Using both positive\nand \\textit{pseudo}-negative observations leads to a supervised learning\nsetting. The generation of pseudo-negative observations that are realistic\nenough to replace missing negative class samples is a bottleneck for current\nGAN-based algorithms. By including an additional classifier into the GAN\narchitecture, we provide a novel GAN-based approach. In our suggested method,\nthe GAN discriminator instructs the generator only to produce samples that fall\ninto the unlabeled data distribution, while a second classifier (observer)\nnetwork monitors the GAN training to: (i) prevent the generated samples from\nfalling into the positive distribution; and (ii) learn the features that are\nthe key distinction between the positive and negative observations.

Most previous studies\nutilize fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) only with extensive\nfeatures to supplement the low information density of the dialogue by multiple\nspeakers. To effectively exploit inherent knowledge of PLMs without extra\nlayers and consider scattered semantic cues on the relation between the\narguments, we propose a Guiding model with RelAtional Semantics using Prompt\n(GRASP). We adopt a prompt-based fine-tuning approach and capture relational\nsemantic clues of a given dialogue with 1) an argument-aware prompt marker\nstrategy and 2) the relational clue detection task. In the experiments, GRASP\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both F1 and F1c scores on a\nDialogRE dataset even though our method only leverages PLMs without adding any\nextra layers.",

    "abstract": "The sense of touch is fundamental to human dexterity. When mimicked in\nrobotic touch, particularly by use of soft optical tactile sensors, it suffers\nfrom distortion due to motion-dependent shear. This complicates tactile tasks\nlike shape reconstruction and exploration that require information about\ncontact geometry. In this work, we pursue a semi-supervised approach to remove\nshear while preserving contact-only information. We validate our approach by\nshowing a match between the model-generated unsheared images with their\ncounterparts from vertically tapping onto the object. The model-generated\nunsheared images give faithful reconstruction of contact-geometry otherwise\nmasked by shear, along with robust estimation of object pose then used for\nsliding exploration and full reconstruction of several planar shapes. We show\nthat our semi-supervised approach achieves comparable performance to its fully\nsupervised counterpart across all validation tasks with an order of magnitude\nless supervision. The semi-supervised method is thus more computational and\nlabeled sample-efficient. We expect it will have broad applicability to wide\nrange of complex tactile exploration and manipulation tasks performed via a\nshear-sensitive sense of touch.",

Even though molecular profiling can uncover the driver\nmutation, the process is often expensive and time-consuming. Deep\nlearning-oriented image analysis offers a more economical alternative for\ndiscovering driver mutations directly from whole slide images (WSIs). In this\nwork, we used customized deep learning pipelines with weak supervision to\nidentify the morphological correlates of EGFR mutation from hematoxylin and\neosin-stained WSIs, in addition to detecting tumor and histologically subtyping\nit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline by conducting rigorous\nexperiments and ablation studies on two lung cancer datasets - TCGA and a\nprivate dataset from India.

Firstly, there is no particular advantage of using a feature\nextractor layers trained on histology, if one is going to fine-tune the feature\nextractor on the target dataset.

    "abstract": "Current methods for text-to-video retrieval (T2VR) are trained and tested on\nvideo-captioning oriented datasets such as MSVD, MSR-VTT and VATEX. A key\nproperty of these datasets is that videos are assumed to be temporally\npre-trimmed with short duration, whilst the provided captions well describe the\ngist of the video content. Consequently, for a given paired video and caption,\nthe video is supposed to be fully relevant to the caption. In reality, however,\nas queries are not known a priori, pre-trimmed video clips may not contain\nsufficient content to fully meet the query. This suggests a gap between the\nliterature and the real world. To fill the gap, we propose in this paper a\nnovel T2VR subtask termed Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR). An\nuntrimmed video is considered to be partially relevant w.r.t. a given textual\nquery if it contains a moment relevant to the query. PRVR aims to retrieve such\npartially relevant videos from a large collection of untrimmed videos. PRVR\ndiffers from single video moment retrieval and video corpus moment retrieval,\nas the latter two are to retrieve moments rather than untrimmed videos. We\nformulate PRVR as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, where a video is\nsimultaneously viewed as a bag of video clips and a bag of video frames. Clips\nand frames represent video content at different time scales. We propose a\nMulti-Scale Similarity Learning (MS-SL) network that jointly learns clip-scale\nand frame-scale similarities for PRVR. Extensive experiments on three datasets\n(TVR, ActivityNet Captions, and Charades-STA) demonstrate the viability of the\nproposed method. We also show that our method can be used for improving video\ncorpus moment retrieval.",

To better study this problem, we build a novel Bregman divergence\nperspective for AT, in which AT can be viewed as the sliding process of the\ntraining data points on the negative entropy curve. Based on this perspective,\nwe analyze the learning objectives of two typical AT methods, i.e., PGD-AT and\nTRADES, and we find that the optimization process of TRADES is easier than\nPGD-AT for that TRADES separates PGD-AT. In addition, we discuss the function\nof entropy in TRADES, and we find that models with high entropy can be better\nrobustness learners. Inspired by the above findings, we propose two methods,\ni.e., FAIT and MER, which can both not only reduce the difficulty of\noptimization under the 10-step PGD adversaries, but also provide better\nrobustness. Our work suggests that reducing the difficulty of optimization\nunder the 10-step PGD adversaries is a promising approach for enhancing the\nadversarial robustness in AT.",

    "abstract": "In computer vision, camera pose estimation from correspondences between 3D\ngeometric entities and their projections into the image has been a widely\ninvestigated problem. Although most state-of-the-art methods exploit low-level\nprimitives such as points or lines, the emergence of very effective CNN-based\nobject detectors in the recent years has paved the way to the use of\nhigher-level features carrying semantically meaningful information. Pioneering\nworks in that direction have shown that modelling 3D objects by ellipsoids and\n2D detections by ellipses offers a convenient manner to link 2D and 3D data.\nHowever, the mathematical formalism most often used in the related litterature\ndoes not enable to easily distinguish ellipsoids and ellipses from other\nquadrics and conics, leading to a loss of specificity potentially detrimental\nin some developments. Moreover, the linearization process of the projection\nequation creates an over-representation of the camera parameters, also possibly\ncausing an efficiency loss. In this paper, we therefore introduce an\nellipsoid-specific theoretical framework and demonstrate its beneficial\nproperties in the context of pose estimation. More precisely, we first show\nthat the proposed formalism enables to reduce the ellipsoid pose estimation\nproblem to a position or orientation-only estimation problem in which the\nremaining unknowns can be derived in closed-form. Then, we demonstrate that it\ncan be further reduced to a 1 Degree-of-Freedom (1DoF) problem and provide the\nanalytical expression of the pose as a function of that unique scalar unknown.\nWe illustrate our theoretical considerations by visual examples. Finally, we\nrelease this work in order to contribute towards more efficient resolutions of\nellipsoid-related pose estimation problems.",

We aim to remedy this by\ntaking advantage of the rich supervisory signal in unlabeled data for learning\nstate representations. This thesis introduces three different representation\nlearning algorithms that have access to different subsets of the data sources\nthat traditional RL algorithms use:\n(i) GRICA is inspired by independent component analysis (ICA) and trains a\ndeep neural network to output statistically independent features of the input.\nGrICA does so by minimizing the mutual information between each feature and the\nother features. Additionally, GrICA only requires an unsorted collection of\nenvironment states.\n(ii) Latent Representation Prediction (LARP) requires more context: in\naddition to requiring a state as an input, it also needs the previous state and\nan action that connects them. This method learns state representations by\npredicting the representation of the environment's next state given a current\nstate and action. The predictor is used with a graph search algorithm.\n(iii) RewPred learns a state representation by training a deep neural network\nto learn a smoothed version of the reward function. The representation is used\nfor preprocessing inputs to deep RL, while the reward predictor is used for\nreward shaping. This method needs only state-reward pairs from the environment\nfor learning the representation.\nWe discover that every method has their strengths and weaknesses, and\nconclude from our experiments that including unsupervised representation\nlearning in RL problem-solving pipelines can speed up learning.",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent developments in the field of cross-modal retrieval, there\nhas been less research focusing on low-resource languages due to the lack of\nmanually annotated datasets. In this paper, we propose a noise-robust\ncross-lingual cross-modal retrieval method for low-resource languages. To this\nend, we use Machine Translation (MT) to construct pseudo-parallel sentence\npairs for low-resource languages. However, as MT is not perfect, it tends to\nintroduce noise during translation, rendering textual embeddings corrupted and\nthereby compromising the retrieval performance. To alleviate this, we introduce\na multi-view self-distillation method to learn noise-robust target-language\nrepresentations, which employs a cross-attention module to generate soft\npseudo-targets to provide direct supervision from the similarity-based view and\nfeature-based view. Besides, inspired by the back-translation in unsupervised\nMT, we minimize the semantic discrepancies between origin sentences and\nback-translated sentences to further improve the noise robustness of the\ntextual encoder. Extensive experiments are conducted on three video-text and\nimage-text cross-modal retrieval benchmarks across different languages, and the\nresults demonstrate that our method significantly improves the overall\nperformance without using extra human-labeled data. In addition, equipped with\na pre-trained visual encoder from a recent vision-and-language pre-training\nframework, i.e., CLIP, our model achieves a significant performance gain,\nshowing that our method is compatible with popular pre-training models.

    "abstract": "The neuromorphic spike camera generates data streams with high temporal\nresolution in a bio-inspired way, which has vast potential in the real-world\napplications such as autonomous driving. In contrast to RGB streams, spike\nstreams have an inherent advantage to overcome motion blur, leading to more\naccurate depth estimation for high-velocity objects. However, training the\nspike depth estimation network in a supervised manner is almost impossible\nsince it is extremely laborious and challenging to obtain paired depth labels\nfor temporally intensive spike streams. In this paper, instead of building a\nspike stream dataset with full depth labels, we transfer knowledge from the\nopen-source RGB datasets (e.g., KITTI) and estimate spike depth in an\nunsupervised manner. The key challenges for such problem lie in the modality\ngap between RGB and spike modalities, and the domain gap between labeled source\nRGB and unlabeled target spike domains. To overcome these challenges, we\nintroduce a cross-modality cross-domain (BiCross) framework for unsupervised\nspike depth estimation. Our method narrows the enormous gap between source RGB\nand target spike by introducing the mediate simulated source spike domain. To\nbe specific, for the cross-modality phase, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine\nKnowledge Distillation (CFKD), which transfers the image and pixel level\nknowledge from source RGB to source spike. Such design leverages the abundant\nsemantic and dense temporal information of RGB and spike modalities\nrespectively. For the cross-domain phase, we introduce the Uncertainty Guided\nMean-Teacher (UGMT) to generate reliable pseudo labels with uncertainty\nestimation, alleviating the shift between the source spike and target spike\ndomains. Besides, we propose a Global-Level Feature Alignment method (GLFA) to\nalign the feature between two domains and generate more reliable pseudo labels.",

    "abstract": "The application of distributed model predictive controllers (DMPC) for\nmulti-agent systems (MASs) necessitates communication between agents, yet the\nconsequence of communication data rates is typically overlooked. This work\nfocuses on developing stability-guaranteed control methods for MASs with\nlimited data rates. Initially, a distributed optimization algorithm with\ndynamic quantization is considered for solving the DMPC problem. Due to the\nlimited data rate, the optimization process suffers from inexact iterations\ncaused by quantization noise and premature termination, leading to sub-optimal\nsolutions. In response, we propose a novel real-time DMPC framework with a\nquantization refinement scheme that updates the quantization parameters on-line\nso that both the quantization noise and the optimization sub-optimality\ndecrease asymptotically. To facilitate the stability analysis, we treat the\nsub-optimally controlled MAS, the quantization refinement scheme, and the\noptimization process as three interconnected subsystems. The cyclic-small-gain\ntheorem is used to derive sufficient conditions on the data rate for\nguaranteeing the asymptotic stability of the system. Finally, the proposed\nalgorithm and theoretical findings are demonstrated on a multi-AUV formation\ncontrol example.",

    "abstract": "A novel deep learning strategy is developed for fast and accurate gas\nproperty measurements using flame emission spectroscopy (FES). Particularly,\nthe short-gated fast FES is essential to resolve fast-evolving combustion\nbehaviors. However, as the exposure time for capturing the flame emission\nspectrum gets shorter, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases, and\ncharacteristic spectral features indicating the gas properties become\nrelatively weaker. Then, the property estimation based on the short-gated\nspectrum is difficult and inaccurate. Denoising convolutional neural networks\n(CNN) can enhance the SNR of the short-gated spectrum. A new CNN architecture\nincluding a reversible down- and up-sampling (DU) operator and a loss function\nbased on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) coefficients is proposed. For\ntraining and testing the CNN, flame chemiluminescence spectra were captured\nfrom a stable methane-air flat flame using a portable spectrometer (spectral\nrange: 250-850 nm, resolution: 0.5 nm) with varied equivalence ratio (0.8-1.2),\npressure (1-10 bar), and exposure time (0.05, 0.2, 0.4, and 2 s). The long\nexposure (2 s) spectra were used as the ground truth when training the\ndenoising CNN. A kriging model with POD is trained by the long-gated spectra\nfor calibration and then prediction of the gas properties taking the denoised\nshort-gated spectrum as the input. The measurement or property prediction\nerrors of pressure and equivalence ratio using the new technique were estimated\nto be 5.7% and 1.5% with 0.2 s exposure, which are exceptionally good and\ntypically not achievable with such low SNR spectrum signals without a signal\namplifier.",

However, there are two challenging\nproblems plaguing the community: i)how to learn robust multi-view\nrepresentation from mass unlabeled data and ii) how to balance the view\nconsistency and the view specificity. To this end, in this paper, we proposed a\nhybrid contrastive fusion algorithm to extract robust view-common\nrepresentation from unlabeled data. Specifically, we found that introducing an\nadditional representation space and aligning representations on this space\nenables the model to learn robust view-common representations. At the same\ntime, we designed an asymmetric contrastive strategy to ensure that the model\ndoes not obtain trivial solutions. Experimental results demonstrated that the\nproposed method outperforms 12 competitive multi-view methods on four\nreal-world datasets in terms of clustering and classification.

    "abstract": "Learning on high-order correlation has shown superiority in data\nrepresentation learning, where hypergraph has been widely used in recent\ndecades. The performance of hypergraph-based representation learning methods,\nsuch as hypergraph neural networks, highly depends on the quality of the\nhypergraph structure. How to generate the hypergraph structure among data is\nstill a challenging task. Missing and noisy data may lead to \"bad connections\"\nin the hypergraph structure and destroy the hypergraph-based representation\nlearning process. Therefore, revealing the high-order structure, i.e., the\nhypergraph behind the observed data, becomes an urgent but important task. To\naddress this issue, we design a general paradigm of deep hypergraph structure\nlearning, namely DeepHGSL, to optimize the hypergraph structure for\nhypergraph-based representation learning. Concretely, inspired by the\ninformation bottleneck principle for the robustness issue, we first extend it\nto the hypergraph case, named by the hypergraph information bottleneck (HIB)\nprinciple. Then, we apply this principle to guide the hypergraph structure\nlearning, where the HIB is introduced to construct the loss function to\nminimize the noisy information in the hypergraph structure. The hypergraph\nstructure can be optimized and this process can be regarded as enhancing the\ncorrect connections and weakening the wrong connections in the training phase.\nTherefore, the proposed method benefits to extract more robust representations\neven on a heavily noisy structure. Finally, we evaluate the model on four\nbenchmark datasets for representation learning. The experimental results on\nboth graph- and hypergraph-structured data demonstrate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of our method compared with other state-of-the-art methods.",

Besides, the novel\nalgorithm adopts a database projection mechanism to reduce the cost of database\nscanning. Moreover, two upper bounds and four pruning strategies are utilized\nto effectively prune the search space.

Several studies have shown that\nthese clues can be automatically extracted using machine learning and allow for\ndetermining a program's author among hundreds of programmers. This attribution\nposes a significant threat to developers of anti-censorship and\nprivacy-enhancing technologies, as they become identifiable and may be\nprosecuted. An ideal protection from this threat would be the anonymization of\nsource code. However, neither theoretical nor practical principles of such an\nanonymization have been explored so far.\nIn this paper, we tackle this problem and develop a framework for reasoning\nabout code anonymization. We prove that the task of generating a $k$-anonymous\nprogram -- a program that cannot be attributed to one of $k$ authors -- is not\ncomputable and thus a dead end for research. As a remedy, we introduce a\nrelaxed concept called $k$-uncertainty, which enables us to measure the\nprotection of developers. Based on this concept, we empirically study candidate\ntechniques for anonymization, such as code normalization, coding style\nimitation, and code obfuscation. We find that none of the techniques provides\nsufficient protection when the attacker is aware of the anonymization.

Hence the information reaching along infeasible paths in an analysis\nis spurious. This affects the precision of the conventional maximum fixed point\n(MFP) solution of the data flow analysis, because it includes the information\nreaching along all control flow paths. The existing approaches for removing\nthis imprecision are either specific to a data flow problem with no\nstraightforward generalization or involve control flow graph restructuring\nwhich may exponentially blow up the size of the CFG.\nWe lift the notion of MFP solution to define the notion of feasible path MFP\n(FPMFP) solutions that exclude the data flowing along known infeasible paths.\nThe notion of FPMFP is generic and does not involve CFG restructuring. Instead,\nit takes externally supplied information about infeasible paths and lifts any\ndata flow analysis to an analysis that maintains the distinctions between\ndifferent paths where these distinctions are beneficial, and ignores them where\nthey are not. Thus it gets the benefit of a path-sensitive analysis where it is\nuseful without performing a conventional path-sensitive analysis.\nWe evaluated the proposed feasible path MFP solutions for reaching\ndefinitions analysis and potentially uninitialized variable analysis on 30\nbenchmarks.

    "abstract": "In this paper we investigate Deep Learning Models using topological dynamical\nsystems, index theory, and computational homology. These mathematical machinery\nwas invented initially by Henri Poincare around 1900 and developed over time to\nunderstand shapes and dynamical systems whose structure and behavior is too\ncomplicated to solve for analytically but can be understood via global\nrelationships. In particular, we show how individual neurons in a neural\nnetwork can correspond to simplexes in a simplicial complex manifold\napproximation to the decision surface learned by the NN, and how these\nsimplexes can be used to compute topological invariants from algebraic topology\nfor the decision manifold with an explicit computation of homology groups by\nhand in a simple case. We also show how the gradient of the probability density\nfunction learned by the NN creates a dynamical system, which can be analyzed by\na myriad of topological tools such as Conley Index Theory, Morse Theory, and\nStable Manifolds. We solve analytically for associated the differential\nequation for a trained NN with a single hidden layer of 256 Neurons applied to\nthe MINST digit dataset, and approximately numerically that it a sink and basin\nof attraction for each of the 10 classes, but the sinks and strong attracting\nmanifolds lie in regions not corresponding to images of actual digits. Index\ntheory implies the existence of saddles. Level sets of the probability\nfunctions are 783-dimensional manifolds which can only change topology at\ncritical points of the dynamical system, and these changes in topology can be\ninvestigated with Morse Theory.",

    "abstract": "It is generally assumed that the brain uses something akin to sparse\ndistributed representations. These representations, however, are\nhigh-dimensional and consequently they affect classification performance of\ntraditional Machine Learning models due to \"the curse of dimensionality\". In\ntasks for which there is a vast amount of labeled data, Deep Networks seem to\nsolve this issue with many layers and a non-Hebbian backpropagation algorithm.\nThe brain, however, seems to be able to solve the problem with few layers. In\nthis work, we hypothesize that this happens by using Hebbian learning.\nActually, the Hebbian-like learning rule of Restricted Boltzmann Machines\nlearns the input patterns asymmetrically. It exclusively learns the correlation\nbetween non-zero values and ignores the zeros, which represent the vast\nmajority of the input dimensionality. By ignoring the zeros \"the curse of\ndimensionality\" problem can be avoided. To test our hypothesis, we generated\nseveral sparse datasets and compared the performance of a Restricted Boltzmann\nMachine classifier with some Backprop-trained networks. The experiments using\nthese codes confirm our initial intuition as the Restricted Boltzmann Machine\nshows a good generalization performance, while the Neural Networks trained with\nthe backpropagation algorithm overfit the training data.",

    "abstract": "Vehicular cloud (VC) platforms integrate heterogeneous and distributed\nresources of moving vehicles to offer timely and cost-effective computing\nservices. However, the dynamic nature of VCs (i.e., limited contact duration\namong vehicles), caused by vehicles' mobility, poses unique challenges to the\nexecution of computation-intensive applications/tasks with directed acyclic\ngraph (DAG) structure, where each task consists of multiple interdependent\ncomponents (subtasks). In this paper, we study scheduling of DAG tasks over\ndynamic VCs, where multiple subtasks of a DAG task are dispersed across\nvehicles and then processed by cooperatively utilizing vehicles' resources. We\nformulate DAG task scheduling as a 0-1 integer programming, aiming to minimize\nthe overall task completion time, while ensuring a high execution success rate,\nwhich turns out to be NP-hard. To tackle the problem, we develop a ranking and\nforesight-integrated dynamic scheduling scheme (RFID). RFID consists of (i) a\ndynamic downward ranking mechanism that sorts the scheduling priority of\ndifferent subtasks, while explicitly taking into account for the sequential\nexecution nature of DAG; (ii) a resource scarcity-based priority changing\nmechanism that overcomes possible performance degradations caused by the\nvolatility of VC resources; and (iii) a degree-based weighted earliest finish\ntime mechanism that assigns the subtask with the highest scheduling priority to\nthe vehicle which offers rapid task execution along with reliable transmission\nlinks.

    "abstract": "Although convolutional representation of multiscale sparse tensor\ndemonstrated its superior efficiency to accurately model the occupancy\nprobability for the compression of geometry component of dense object point\nclouds, its capacity for representing sparse LiDAR point cloud geometry (PCG)\nwas largely limited. This is because 1) fixed receptive field of the\nconvolution cannot characterize extremely and unevenly distributed sparse LiDAR\npoints very well; and 2) pretrained convolutions with fixed weights are\ninsufficient to dynamically capture information conditioned on the input. This\nwork therefore suggests the neighborhood point attention (NPA) to tackle them,\nwhere we first use k nearest neighbors (kNN) to construct adaptive local\nneighborhood; and then leverage the self-attention mechanism to dynamically\naggregate information within this neighborhood. Such NPA is devised as a\nNPAFormer to best exploit cross-scale and same-scale correlations for geometric\noccupancy probability estimation. Compared with the anchor using standardized\nG-PCC, our method provides >17% BD-rate gains for lossy compression, and >14%\nbitrate reduction for lossless scenario using popular LiDAR point clouds in\nSemanticKITTI and Ford datasets.

Our goal is to output a\npolicy that is socially fair with respect to different reward functions. Prior\nworks have proposed different objectives that a fair policy must optimize\nincluding minimum welfare, and generalized Gini welfare. We first take an\naxiomatic view of the problem, and propose four axioms that any such fair\nobjective must satisfy. We show that the Nash social welfare is the unique\nobjective that uniquely satisfies all four objectives, whereas prior objectives\nfail to satisfy all four axioms. We then consider the learning version of the\nproblem where the underlying model i.e. Markov decision process is unknown. We\nconsider the problem of minimizing regret with respect to the fair policies\nmaximizing three different fair objectives -- minimum welfare, generalized Gini\nwelfare, and Nash social welfare. Based on optimistic planning, we propose a\ngeneric learning algorithm and derive its regret bound with respect to the\nthree different policies. For the objective of Nash social welfare, we also\nderive a lower bound in regret that grows exponentially with $n$, the number of\nagents. Finally, we show that for the objective of minimum welfare, one can\nimprove regret by a factor of $O(H)$ for a weaker notion of regret.",

We make three contributions. First, we expose the complexity of\ncausal inference in the context of adaptive bit rate video streaming, a\nchallenging domain where the network conditions during the session act as a\nsequence of latent and confounding variables, and a change at any point in the\nsession has a cascading impact on the rest of the session. Second, we present\nVeritas, a novel framework that tackles causal reasoning for video streaming\nwithout resorting to randomised trials. Integral to Veritas is an easy to\ninterpret domain-specific ML model (an embedded Hidden Markov Model) that\nrelates the latent stochastic process (intrinsic bandwidth that the video\nsession can achieve) to actual observations (download times) while exploiting\ncontrol variables such as the TCP state (e.g., congestion window) observed at\nthe start of the download of video chunks. We show through experiments on an\nemulation testbed that Veritas can answer both counterfactual queries (e.g.,\nthe performance of a completed video session had it used a different buffer\nsize) and interventional queries (e.g., estimating the download time for every\npossible video quality choice for the next chunk in a session in progress). In\ndoing so, Veritas achieves accuracy close to an ideal oracle, while\nsignificantly outperforming both a commonly used baseline approach, and Fugu\n(an off-the-shelf neural network) neither of which account for causal effects.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge tracing (KT) is a field of study that predicts the future\nperformance of students based on prior performance datasets collected from\neducational applications such as intelligent tutoring systems, learning\nmanagement systems, and online courses. Some previous studies on KT have\nconcentrated only on the interpretability of the model, whereas others have\nfocused on enhancing the performance. Models that consider both\ninterpretability and the performance improvement have been insufficient.\nMoreover, models that focus on performance improvements have not shown an\noverwhelming performance compared with existing models. In this study, we\npropose MonaCoBERT, which achieves the best performance on most benchmark\ndatasets and has significant interpretability. MonaCoBERT uses a BERT-based\narchitecture with monotonic convolutional multihead attention, which reflects\nforgetting behavior of the students and increases the representation power of\nthe model. We can also increase the performance and interpretability using a\nclassical test-theory-based (CTT-based) embedding strategy that considers the\ndifficulty of the question. To determine why MonaCoBERT achieved the best\nperformance and interpret the results quantitatively, we conducted ablation\nstudies and additional analyses using Grad-CAM, UMAP, and various visualization\ntechniques. The analysis results demonstrate that both attention components\ncomplement one another and that CTT-based embedding represents information on\nboth global and local difficulties.

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) necessitates careful\nanalysis of its ethical implications. In addressing ethics and fairness\nimplications, it is important to examine the whole range of ethically relevant\nfeatures rather than looking at individual agents alone. This can be\naccomplished by shifting perspective to the systems in which agents are\nembedded, which is encapsulated in the macro ethics of sociotechnical systems\n(STS). Through the lens of macro ethics, the governance of systems - which is\nwhere participants try to promote outcomes and norms which reflect their values\n- is key. However, multiple-user social dilemmas arise in an STS when\nstakeholders of the STS have different value preferences or when norms in the\nSTS conflict. To develop equitable governance which meets the needs of\ndifferent stakeholders, and resolve these dilemmas in satisfactory ways with a\nhigher goal of fairness, we need to integrate a variety of normative ethical\nprinciples in reasoning. Normative ethical principles are understood as\noperationalizable rules inferred from philosophical theories. A taxonomy of\nethical principles is thus beneficial to enable practitioners to utilise them\nin reasoning.\nThis work develops a taxonomy of normative ethical principles which can be\noperationalized in the governance of STS. We identify an array of ethical\nprinciples, with 25 nodes on the taxonomy tree. We describe the ways in which\neach principle has previously been operationalized, and suggest how the\noperationalization of principles may be applied to the macro ethics of STS. We\nfurther explain potential difficulties that may arise with each principle. We\nenvision this taxonomy will facilitate the development of methodologies to\nincorporate ethical principles in reasoning capacities for governing equitable\nSTS.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a paradigm shift by viewing the task of affect modeling\nas a reinforcement learning (RL) process. According to the proposed paradigm,\nRL agents learn a policy (i.e. affective interaction) by attempting to maximize\na set of rewards (i.e. behavioral and affective patterns) via their experience\nwith their environment (i.e. context). Our hypothesis is that RL is an\neffective paradigm for interweaving affect elicitation and manifestation with\nbehavioral and affective demonstrations. Importantly, our second\nhypothesis-building on Damasio's somatic marker hypothesis-is that emotion can\nbe the facilitator of decision-making. We test our hypotheses in a racing game\nby training Go-Blend agents to model human demonstrations of arousal and\nbehavior; Go-Blend is a modified version of the Go-Explore algorithm which has\nrecently showcased supreme performance in hard exploration tasks. We first vary\nthe arousal-based reward function and observe agents that can effectively\ndisplay a palette of affect and behavioral patterns according to the specified\nreward. Then we use arousal-based state selection mechanisms in order to bias\nthe strategies that Go-Blend explores. Our findings suggest that Go-Blend not\nonly is an efficient affect modeling paradigm but, more importantly,\naffect-driven RL improves exploration and yields higher performing agents,\nvalidating Damasio's hypothesis in the domain of games.",

    "abstract": "Accurately and quickly binuclear cell (BC) detection plays a significant role\nin predicting the risk of leukemia and other malignant tumors. However, manual\nmicroscopy counting is time-consuming and lacks objectivity. Moreover, with the\nlimitation of staining quality and diversity of morphology features in BC\nmicroscopy whole slide images (WSIs), traditional image processing approaches\nare helpless. To overcome this challenge, we propose a two-stage detection\nmethod inspired by the structure prior of BC based on deep learning, which\ncascades to implement BCs coarse detection at the WSI-level and fine-grained\nclassification in patch-level. The coarse detection network is a multi-task\ndetection framework based on circular bounding boxes for cells detection, and\ncentral key points for nucleus detection. The circle representation reduces the\ndegrees of freedom, mitigates the effect of surrounding impurities compared to\nusual rectangular boxes and can be rotation invariant in WSI. Detecting key\npoints in the nucleus can assist network perception and be used for\nunsupervised color layer segmentation in later fine-grained classification. The\nfine classification network consists of a background region suppression module\nbased on color layer mask supervision and a key region selection module based\non a transformer due to its global modeling capability. Additionally, an\nunsupervised and unpaired cytoplasm generator network is firstly proposed to\nexpand the long-tailed distribution dataset. Finally, experiments are performed\non BC multicenter datasets. The proposed BC fine detection method outperforms\nother benchmarks in almost all the evaluation criteria, providing clarification\nand support for tasks such as cancer screenings.",

The first step\ntowards full autonomy is reliable obstacle avoidance, which has proven to be\ntechnically challenging by itself in a generic indoor environment. Current\napproaches utilize vision-based or 1-dimensional sensors to support nano-drone\nperception algorithms. This work presents a lightweight obstacle avoidance\nsystem based on a novel millimeter form factor 64 pixels multi-zone\nTime-of-Flight (ToF) sensor and a generalized model-free control policy.\nReported in-field tests are based on the Crazyflie 2.1, extended by a custom\nmulti-zone ToF deck, featuring a total flight mass of 35g.

Traditional serial time-marching schemes can be a\nsignificant bottleneck, as many types of simulations require large numbers of\ntime-steps which must be computed sequentially. Parallel in Time schemes, such\nas the Multigrid Reduction in Time (MGRIT) method, remedy this by parallelizing\nacross time-steps, and have shown promising results for parabolic problems.\nHowever, chaotic problems have proved more difficult, since chaotic initial\nvalue problems (IVPs) are inherently ill-conditioned. MGRIT relies on a\nhierarchy of successively coarser time-grids to iteratively correct the\nsolution on the finest time-grid, but due to the nature of chaotic systems,\nsmall inaccuracies on the coarser levels can be greatly magnified and lead to\npoor coarse-grid corrections. Here we introduce a modified MGRIT algorithm\nbased on an existing quadratically converging nonlinear extension to the\nmultigrid Full Approximation Scheme (FAS), as well as a novel time-coarsening\nscheme. Together, these approaches better capture long-term chaotic behavior on\ncoarse-grids and greatly improve convergence of MGRIT for chaotic IVPs.\nFurther, we introduce a novel low memory variant of the algorithm for solving\nchaotic PDEs with MGRIT which not only solves the IVP, but also provides\nestimates for the unstable Lyapunov vectors of the system. We provide\nsupporting numerical results for the Lorenz system and demonstrate parallel\nspeedup for the chaotic Kuramoto- Sivashinsky partial differential equation\nover a significantly longer time-domain than in previous works.",

To alleviate this, we propose an edge-based\nfiltering stage that removes privacy-sensitive attributes before the sensor\ndata are transmitted to the cloud. We use state-of-the-art image manipulation\ntechniques that leverage disentangled representations to achieve privacy\nfiltering. We define opt-in and opt-out filter operations and evaluate their\neffectiveness for filtering private attributes from face images. Additionally,\nwe examine the effect of naturally occurring correlations and residual\ninformation on filtering. We find the results promising and believe this\nelicits further research on how image manipulation can be used for privacy\npreservation.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of crop yield before harvest is of great importance for\ncrop logistics, market planning, and food distribution around the world. Yield\nprediction requires monitoring of phenological and climatic characteristics\nover extended time periods to model the complex relations involved in crop\ndevelopment. Remote sensing satellite images provided by various satellites\ncircumnavigating the world are a cheap and reliable way to obtain data for\nyield prediction. The field of yield prediction is currently dominated by Deep\nLearning approaches. While the accuracies reached with those approaches are\npromising, the needed amounts of data and the ``black-box'' nature can restrict\nthe application of Deep Learning methods. The limitations can be overcome by\nproposing a pipeline to process remote sensing images into feature-based\nrepresentations that allow the employment of Extreme Gradient Boosting\n(XGBoost) for yield prediction. A comparative evaluation of soybean yield\nprediction within the United States shows promising prediction accuracies\ncompared to state-of-the-art yield prediction systems based on Deep Learning.\nFeature importances expose the near-infrared spectrum of light as an important\nfeature within our models. The reported results hint at the capabilities of\nXGBoost for yield prediction and encourage future experiments with XGBoost for\nyield prediction on other crops in regions all around the world.",

    "abstract": "The ever growing abundance of learning traces in the online learning\nplatforms promises unique insights into the learner knowledge assessment (LKA),\na fundamental personalized-tutoring technique for enabling various further\nadaptive tutoring services in these platforms. Precise assessment of learner\nknowledge requires the fine-grained Q-matrix, which is generally designed by\nexperts to map the items to skills in the domain. Due to the subjective\ntendency, some misspecifications may degrade the performance of LKA. Some\nefforts have been made to refine the small-scale Q-matrix, however, it is\ndifficult to extend the scalability and apply these methods to the large-scale\nonline learning context with numerous items and massive skills. Moreover, the\nexisting LKA models employ flexible deep learning models that excel at this\ntask, but the adequacy of LKA is still challenged by the representation\ncapability of the models on the quite sparse item-skill graph and the learners'\nexercise data. To overcome these issues, in this paper we propose a\nprerequisite-driven Q-matrix refinement framework for learner knowledge\nassessment (PQRLKA) in online context. We infer the prerequisites from\nlearners' response data and use it to refine the expert-defined Q-matrix, which\nenables the interpretability and the scalability to apply it to the large-scale\nonline learning context. Based on the refined Q-matrix, we propose a\nMetapath2Vec enhanced convolutional representation method to obtain the\ncomprehensive representations of the items with rich information, and feed them\nto the PQRLKA model to finally assess the learners' knowledge. Experiments\nconducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the capability of our model\nto infer the prerequisites for Q-matrix refinement, and also its superiority\nfor the LKA task.",

    "abstract": "It is a common practice to think of a video as a sequence of images (frames),\nand re-use deep neural network models that are trained only on images for\nsimilar analytics tasks on videos. In this paper, we show that this leap of\nfaith that deep learning models that work well on images will also work well on\nvideos is actually flawed. We show that even when a video camera is viewing a\nscene that is not changing in any human-perceptible way, and we control for\nexternal factors like video compression and environment (lighting), the\naccuracy of video analytics application fluctuates noticeably. These\nfluctuations occur because successive frames produced by the video camera may\nlook similar visually, but these frames are perceived quite differently by the\nvideo analytics applications. We observed that the root cause for these\nfluctuations is the dynamic camera parameter changes that a video camera\nautomatically makes in order to capture and produce a visually pleasing video.\nThe camera inadvertently acts as an unintentional adversary because these\nslight changes in the image pixel values in consecutive frames, as we show,\nhave a noticeably adverse impact on the accuracy of insights from video\nanalytics tasks that re-use image-trained deep learning models. To address this\ninadvertent adversarial effect from the camera, we explore the use of transfer\nlearning techniques to improve learning in video analytics tasks through the\ntransfer of knowledge from learning on image analytics tasks. In particular, we\nshow that our newly trained Yolov5 model reduces fluctuation in object\ndetection across frames, which leads to better tracking of objects(40% fewer\nmistakes in tracking). Our paper also provides new directions and techniques to\nmitigate the camera's adversarial effect on deep learning models used for video\nanalytics applications.",

    "abstract": "The European Union is likely to introduce among the first, most stringent,\nand most comprehensive AI regulatory regimes of the world's major\njurisdictions. In this report, we ask whether the EU's upcoming regulation for\nAI will diffuse globally, producing a so-called \"Brussels Effect\". Building on\nand extending Anu Bradford's work, we outline the mechanisms by which such\nregulatory diffusion may occur. We consider both the possibility that the EU's\nAI regulation will incentivise changes in products offered in non-EU countries\n(a de facto Brussels Effect) and the possibility it will influence regulation\nadopted by other jurisdictions (a de jure Brussels Effect). Focusing on the\nproposed EU AI Act, we tentatively conclude that both de facto and de jure\nBrussels effects are likely for parts of the EU regulatory regime. A de facto\neffect is particularly likely to arise in large US tech companies with AI\nsystems that the AI Act terms \"high-risk\". We argue that the upcoming\nregulation might be particularly important in offering the first and most\ninfluential operationalisation of what it means to develop and deploy\ntrustworthy or human-centred AI.

    "abstract": "Depth estimation is essential for various important real-world applications\nsuch as autonomous driving. However, it suffers from severe performance\ndegradation in high-velocity scenario since traditional cameras can only\ncapture blurred images. To deal with this problem, the spike camera is designed\nto capture the pixel-wise luminance intensity at high frame rate. However,\ndepth estimation with spike camera remains very challenging using traditional\nmonocular or stereo depth estimation algorithms, which are based on the\nphotometric consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Guided\nDepth Fusion (UGDF) framework to fuse the predictions of monocular and stereo\ndepth estimation networks for spike camera. Our framework is motivated by the\nfact that stereo spike depth estimation achieves better results at close range\nwhile monocular spike depth estimation obtains better results at long range.\nTherefore, we introduce a dual-task depth estimation architecture with a joint\ntraining strategy and estimate the distributed uncertainty to fuse the\nmonocular and stereo results. In order to demonstrate the advantage of spike\ndepth estimation over traditional camera depth estimation, we contribute a\nspike-depth dataset named CitySpike20K, which contains 20K paired samples, for\nspike depth estimation. UGDF achieves state-of-the-art results on CitySpike20K,\nsurpassing all monocular or stereo spike depth estimation baselines. We conduct\nextensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of our\nmethod on CitySpike20K. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the\nfirst dual-task fusion framework for spike camera depth estimation. Code and\ndataset will be released.",

    "abstract": "Programs are a kind of communication to both computers and people, hence as\nstudents are trained to write programs they need to learn to write\nwell-designed, readable code rather than code that simply functions correctly.\nThe difficulty in teaching good design practices that promote readability is\nthe labor intensiveness of assessing student programs. Typically assessing\ndesign quality involves a careful reading of student programs in order to give\npersonalized feedback which naturally is time consuming for instructors. We\npropose a rule-based system that assesses student programs for quality of\ndesign of and provides personalized, precise feedback on how to improve their\nwork. To study its effectiveness, we made the system available to students by\ndeploying it online, allowing students to receive feedback and make corrections\nbefore turning in their assignments. The students benefited from the system and\nthe rate of design quality flaws dropped 47.84\\% on average over 4 different\nassignments, 2 in Python and 2 in Java, in comparison to the previous 2 to 3\nyears of student submissions.",

    "abstract": "The past few years have witnessed the burst of drone-based applications where\ncomputer vision plays an essential role. However, most public drone-based\nvision datasets focus on detection and tracking. On the other hand, the\nperformance of most existing image super-resolution methods is sensitive to the\ndataset, specifically, the degradation model between high-resolution and\nlow-resolution images. In this thesis, we propose the first image\nsuper-resolution dataset for drone vision. Image pairs are captured by two\ncameras on the drone with different focal lengths. We collect data at different\naltitudes and then propose pre-processing steps to align image pairs. Extensive\nempirical studies show domain gaps exist among images captured at different\naltitudes. Meanwhile, the performance of pretrained image super-resolution\nnetworks also suffers a drop on our dataset and varies among altitudes.\nFinally, we propose two methods to build a robust image super-resolution\nnetwork at different altitudes. The first feeds altitude information into the\nnetwork through altitude-aware layers. The second uses one-shot learning to\nquickly adapt the super-resolution model to unknown altitudes. Our results\nreveal that the proposed methods can efficiently improve the performance of\nsuper-resolution networks at varying altitudes.",

    "abstract": "End-to-end (E2E) models have become the default choice for state-of-the-art\nspeech recognition systems. Such models are trained on large amounts of\nlabelled data, which are often not available for low-resource languages.\nTechniques such as self-supervised learning and transfer learning hold promise,\nbut have not yet been effective in training accurate models. On the other hand,\ncollecting labelled datasets on a diverse set of domains and speakers is very\nexpensive. In this work, we demonstrate an inexpensive and effective\nalternative to these approaches by ``mining'' text and audio pairs for Indian\nlanguages from public sources, specifically from the public archives of All\nIndia Radio. As a key component, we adapt the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to\nalign sentences with corresponding audio segments given a long audio and a PDF\nof its transcript, while being robust to errors due to OCR, extraneous text,\nand non-transcribed speech. We thus create Shrutilipi, a dataset which contains\nover 6,400 hours of labelled audio across 12 Indian languages totalling to\n4.95M sentences. On average, Shrutilipi results in a 2.3x increase over\npublicly available labelled data. We establish the quality of Shrutilipi with\n21 human evaluators across the 12 languages. We also establish the diversity of\nShrutilipi in terms of represented regions, speakers, and mentioned named\nentities. Significantly, we show that adding Shrutilipi to the training set of\nWav2Vec models leads to an average decrease in WER of 5.8\\% for 7 languages on\nthe IndicSUPERB benchmark. For Hindi, which has the most benchmarks (7), the\naverage WER falls from 18.8% to 13.5%. This improvement extends to efficient\nmodels: We show a 2.3% drop in WER for a Conformer model (10x smaller than\nWav2Vec). Finally, we demonstrate the diversity of Shrutilipi by showing that\nthe model trained with it is more robust to noisy input.",

    "abstract": "Detecting actions in videos have been widely applied in on-device\napplications. Practical on-device videos are always untrimmed with both action\nand background. It is desirable for a model to both recognize the class of\naction and localize the temporal position where the action happens. Such a task\nis called temporal action location (TAL), which is always trained on the cloud\nwhere multiple untrimmed videos are collected and labeled. It is desirable for\na TAL model to continuously and locally learn from new data, which can directly\nimprove the action detection precision while protecting customers' privacy.\nHowever, it is non-trivial to train a TAL model, since tremendous video samples\nwith temporal annotations are required. However, annotating videos frame by\nframe is exorbitantly time-consuming and expensive. Although weakly-supervised\nTAL (W-TAL) has been proposed to learn from untrimmed videos with only\nvideo-level labels, such an approach is also not suitable for on-device\nlearning scenarios. In practical on-device learning applications, data are\ncollected in streaming. Dividing such a long video stream into multiple video\nsegments requires lots of human effort, which hinders the exploration of\napplying the TAL tasks to realistic on-device learning applications. To enable\nW-TAL models to learn from a long, untrimmed streaming video, we propose an\nefficient video learning approach that can directly adapt to new environments.\nWe first propose a self-adaptive video dividing approach with a contrast\nscore-based segment merging approach to convert the video stream into multiple\nsegments. Then, we explore different sampling strategies on the TAL tasks to\nrequest as few labels as possible. To the best of our knowledge, we are the\nfirst attempt to directly learn from the on-device, long video stream.",

    "abstract": "Modern video games are rapidly growing in size and scale, and to create rich\nand interesting environments, a large amount of content is needed. As a\nconsequence, often several thousands of detailed 3D assets are used to create a\nsingle scene. As each asset's polygon mesh can contain millions of polygons,\nthe number of polygons that need to be drawn every frame may exceed several\nbillions. Therefore, the computational resources often limit how many detailed\nobjects that can be displayed in a scene. To push this limit and to optimize\nperformance one can reduce the polygon count of the assets when possible.\nBasically, the idea is that an object at farther distance from the capturing\ncamera, consequently with relatively smaller screen size, its polygon count may\nbe reduced without affecting the perceived quality. Level of Detail (LOD)\nrefers to the complexity level of a 3D model representation. The process of\nremoving complexity is often called LOD reduction and can be done automatically\nwith an algorithm or by hand by artists. However, this process may lead to\ndeterioration of the visual quality if the different LODs differ significantly,\nor if LOD reduction transition is not seamless. Today the validation of these\nresults is mainly done manually requiring an expert to visually inspect the\nresults. However, this process is slow, mundane, and therefore prone to error.\nHerein we propose a method to automate this process based on the use of deep\nconvolutional networks. We report promising results and envision that this\nmethod can be used to automate the process of LOD reduction testing and\nvalidation.",

    "abstract": "Few-shot learning models learn representations with limited human\nannotations, and such a learning paradigm demonstrates practicability in\nvarious tasks, e.g., image classification, object detection, etc. However,\nfew-shot object detection methods suffer from an intrinsic defect that the\nlimited training data makes the model cannot sufficiently explore semantic\ninformation. To tackle this, we introduce knowledge distillation to the\nfew-shot object detection learning paradigm. We further run a motivating\nexperiment, which demonstrates that in the process of knowledge distillation\nthe empirical error of the teacher model degenerates the prediction performance\nof the few-shot object detection model, as the student. To understand the\nreasons behind this phenomenon, we revisit the learning paradigm of knowledge\ndistillation on the few-shot object detection task from the causal theoretic\nstandpoint, and accordingly, develop a Structural Causal Model. Following the\ntheoretical guidance, we propose a backdoor adjustment-based knowledge\ndistillation method for the few-shot object detection task, namely Disentangle\nand Remerge (D&R), to perform conditional causal intervention toward the\ncorresponding Structural Causal Model. Theoretically, we provide an extended\ndefinition, i.e., general backdoor path, for the backdoor criterion, which can\nexpand the theoretical application boundary of the backdoor criterion in\nspecific cases. Empirically, the experiments on multiple benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that D&R can yield significant performance boosts in few-shot\nobject detection.",

    "abstract": "With the tremendous success of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), they have\nbeen widely applied to recommender systems and have shown promising\nperformance. However, most GCN-based methods rigorously stick to a common GCN\nlearning paradigm and suffer from two limitations: (1) the limited scalability\ndue to the high computational cost and slow training convergence; (2) the\nnotorious over-smoothing issue which reduces performance as stacking graph\nconvolution layers. We argue that the above limitations are due to the lack of\na deep understanding of GCN-based methods. To this end, we first investigate\nwhat design makes GCN effective for recommendation. By simplifying LightGCN, we\nshow the close connection between GCN-based and low-rank methods such as\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Matrix Factorization (MF), where\nstacking graph convolution layers is to learn a low-rank representation by\nemphasizing (suppressing) components with larger (smaller) singular values.\nBased on this observation, we replace the core design of GCN-based methods with\na flexible truncated SVD and propose a simplified GCN learning paradigm dubbed\nSVD-GCN, which only exploits $K$-largest singular vectors for recommendation.\nTo alleviate the over-smoothing issue, we propose a renormalization trick to\nadjust the singular value gap, resulting in significant improvement. Extensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets show that our proposed SVD-GCN not\nonly significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts but also achieves over 100x\nand 10x speedups over LightGCN and MF, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Neural surface reconstruction aims to reconstruct accurate 3D surfaces based\non multi-view images. Previous methods based on neural volume rendering mostly\ntrain a fully implicit model, and they require hours of training for a single\nscene. Recent efforts explore the explicit volumetric representation, which\nsubstantially accelerates the optimization process by memorizing significant\ninformation in learnable voxel grids. However, these voxel-based methods often\nstruggle in reconstructing fine-grained geometry. Through empirical studies, we\nfound that high-quality surface reconstruction hinges on two key factors: the\ncapability of constructing a coherent shape and the precise modeling of\ncolor-geometry dependency. In particular, the latter is the key to the accurate\nreconstruction of fine details. Inspired by these findings, we develop Voxurf,\na voxel-based approach for efficient and accurate neural surface\nreconstruction, which consists of two stages: 1) leverage a learnable feature\ngrid to construct the color field and obtain a coherent coarse shape, and 2)\nrefine detailed geometry with a dual color network that captures precise\ncolor-geometry dependency. We further introduce a hierarchical geometry feature\nto enable information sharing across voxels. Our experiments show that Voxurf\nachieves high efficiency and high quality at the same time.

    "abstract": "The use of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) to solve inverse\nproblems such as slice-to-volume registration and 3D reconstruction is\nwell-studied in preoperative settings. In intraoperative imaging, the utility\nof DRRs is limited by the challenges in generating them in real-time and\nsupporting optimization procedures that rely on repeated DRR synthesis. While\nimmense progress has been made in accelerating the generation of DRRs through\nalgorithmic refinements and GPU implementations, DRR-based optimization remains\nslow because most DRR generators do not offer a straightforward way to obtain\ngradients with respect to the imaging parameters. To make DRRs interoperable\nwith gradient-based optimization and deep learning frameworks, we have\nreformulated Siddon's method, the most popular ray-tracing algorithm used in\nDRR generation, as a series of vectorized tensor operations. We implemented\nthis vectorized version of Siddon's method in PyTorch, taking advantage of the\nlibrary's strong automatic differentiation engine to make this DRR generator\nfully differentiable with respect to its parameters. Additionally, using\nGPU-accelerated tensor computation enables our vectorized implementation to\nachieve rendering speeds equivalent to state-of-the-art DRR generators\nimplemented in CUDA and C++. We illustrate the resulting method in the context\nof slice-to-volume registration. Moreover, our simulations suggest that the\nloss landscapes for the slice-to-volume registration problem are convex in the\nneighborhood of the optimal solution, and gradient-based registration promises\na much faster solution than prevailing gradient-free optimization strategies.\nThe proposed DRR generator enables fast computer vision algorithms to support\nimage guidance in minimally invasive procedures.

A significant portion of production clusters is now\ndedicated to long-running applications (LRAs), which are typically in the form\nof microservices and executed in the order of hours or even months. It is\ntherefore practically important to plan ahead the placement of LRAs in a shared\ncluster so that the number of compute nodes required by them can be minimized\nto reduce carbon footprint and lower operational costs. Existing works on LRA\nscheduling are often application-agnostic, without particularly addressing the\nconstraining requirements imposed by LRAs, such as co-location affinity\nconstraints and time-varying resource requirements. In this paper, we present\nan affinity-aware resource provisioning approach for deploying large-scale LRAs\nin a shared cluster subject to multiple constraints, with the objective of\nminimizing the number of compute nodes in use.

RPC is widely applied\nin industry for building large-scale distributed systems, such as\nMicroservices. Modern RPC frameworks include for example Thrift, gRPC, SOFARPC\nand Dubbo. Testing such systems using RPC communications is very challenging,\ndue to the complexity of distributed systems and various RPC frameworks the\nsystem could employ. To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist any\ntool or solution that could enable automated testing of modern RPC-based\nservices. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose the first approach in the\nliterature, together with an open-source tool, for white-box fuzzing modern\nRPC-based APIs with search. To assess our novel approach, we conducted an\nempirical study with two artificial and four industrial web services selected\nby our industrial partner. The tool has been integrated into a real industrial\npipeline, and could be applied to real industrial development process for\nfuzzing RPC-based APIs. To further demonstrate its effectiveness and\napplication in industrial settings, we also report results of employing our\ntool for fuzzing another 30 industrial APIs autonomously conducted by our\nindustrial partner in their testing processes. Results show that our novel\napproach is capable of enabling automated test case generation for industrial\nRPC-based APIs (i.e., two artificial and 34 industrial). We also compared with\na simple grey-box technique and existing manually written tests. Our white-box\nsolution achieves significant improvements on code coverage.

However, on recursive constrained data-structures\n(e.g., sorted lists, binary search trees, quadtrees), and, more generally, when\nthe structures are highly constrained, generating uniformly distributed inputs\nis difficult. In this paper, we present Testify: a framework in which users can\ndefine algebraic data-types decorated with high-level constraints. These\nconstraints are interpreted as membership predicates that restrict the set of\ninhabitants of the type. From these definitions, Testify automatically\nsynthesises a partial specification of the program so that no function produces\na value that violates the constraints (e.g. a binary search tree where nodes\nare improperly inserted). Our framework augments the original program with\ntests that check such properties. To achieve that, we automatically produce\nuniform random samplers that generate values which satisfy the constraints, and\nverifies the validity of the outputs of the tested functions. By generating the\nshape of a recursive data-structure using Boltzmann sampling and generating\nevenly distributed finite domain variable values using constraint solving, our\nframework guarantees size-constrained uniform sampling of test cases.

State-of-the-art text-to-image\ngeneration models are mainly designed for center-object generation, e.g.,\nflowers and birds. Unlike center-placed objects with similar shapes and\norientation, person image generation is a more challenging task, for which we\nobserve the followings: 1) the generated images for the same person exhibit\nvisual details with identity-consistency, e.g., identity-related\ntextures/clothes/shoes across the images, and 2) those images should be\ndiscriminant for being robust against the inter-person variations caused by\nvisual ambiguities. To address the above challenges, we develop an effective\ngenerative model to produce person images with two novel mechanisms. In\nparticular, our first mechanism (called T-Person-GAN-ID) is to integrate the\none-stream generator with an identity-preserving network such that the\nrepresentations of generated data are regularized in their feature space to\nensure the identity-consistency. The second mechanism (called\nT-Person-GAN-ID-MM) is based on the manifold mix-up to produce mixed images via\nthe linear interpolation across generated images from different manifold\nidentities, and we further enforce such interpolated images to be linearly\nclassified in the feature space. This amounts to learning a linear\nclassification boundary that can perfectly separate images from two identities.\nOur proposed method is empirically validated to achieve a remarkable\nimprovement in text-to-person image generation. Our architecture is orthogonal\nto StackGAN++ , and focuses on person image generation, with all of them\ntogether to enrich the spectrum of GANs for the image generation task.

Currently, the Edge\nIntelligence System (EIS) concept that leverages the merits of edge computing\nand Artificial Intelligence (AI) is utilized to provide smart cloud services\nwith powerful computational processing and reduce decision-making delays. Thus,\nEIS offers a possible solution to realizing future Intelligent Transportation\nSystems (ITS), especially in a vehicular network framework.

This is hindering the\nadoption of AI in safety-critical applications, where high interests are at\nstake. In these applications, explainable by design models, such as decision\ntrees, may be more suitable, as they provide interpretability.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, most telecommunication services adhere to the Service Function\nChain (SFC) paradigm, where network functions are implemented via software. In\nparticular, container virtualization is becoming a popular approach to deploy\nnetwork functions and to enable resource slicing among several tenants. The\nresulting infrastructure is a complex system composed by a huge amount of\ncontainers implementing different SFC functionalities, along with different\ntenants sharing the same chain. The complexity of such a scenario lead us to\nevaluate two critical metrics: the steady-state availability (the probability\nthat a system is functioning in long runs) and the latency (the time between a\nservice request and the pertinent response). Consequently, we propose a\nlatency-driven availability assessment for multi-tenant service chains\nimplemented via Containerized Network Functions (CNFs). We adopt a multi-state\nsystem to model single CNFs and the queueing formalism to characterize the\nservice latency. To efficiently compute the availability, we develop a modified\nversion of the Multidimensional Universal Generating Function (MUGF) technique.\nFinally, we solve an optimization problem to minimize the SFC cost under an\navailability constraint. As a relevant example of SFC, we consider a\ncontainerized version of IP Multimedia Subsystem, whose parameters have been\nestimated through fault injection techniques and load tests.",

    "abstract": "Structural monitoring for complex built environments often suffers from\nmismatch between design, laboratory testing, and actual built parameters.\nAdditionally, real-world structural identification problems encounter many\nchallenges. For example, the lack of accurate baseline models, high\ndimensionality, and complex multivariate partial differential equations (PDEs)\npose significant difficulties in training and learning conventional data-driven\nalgorithms. This paper explores a new framework, dubbed NeuralSI, for\nstructural identification by augmenting PDEs that govern structural dynamics\nwith neural networks. Our approach seeks to estimate nonlinear parameters from\ngoverning equations. We consider the vibration of nonlinear beams with two\nunknown parameters, one that represents geometric and material variations, and\nanother that captures energy losses in the system mainly through damping. The\ndata for parameter estimation is obtained from a limited set of measurements,\nwhich is conducive to applications in structural health monitoring where the\nexact state of an existing structure is typically unknown and only a limited\namount of data samples can be collected in the field. The trained model can\nalso be extrapolated under both standard and extreme conditions using the\nidentified structural parameters. We compare with pure data-driven Neural\nNetworks and other classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Our\napproach reduces both interpolation and extrapolation errors in displacement\ndistribution by two to five orders of magnitude over the baselines.

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of distributed energy resources, and the advent of\nsmart grid technologies, have allowed traditionally passive power system users\nto become actively involved in energy trading. Recognizing the fact that the\ntraditional centralized grid-driven energy markets offer minimal profitability\nto these users, recent research has shifted focus towards decentralized\npeer-to-peer (P2P) energy markets. In these markets, users trade energy with\neach other, with higher benefits than buying or selling to the grid. However,\nmost researches in P2P energy trading largely overlook the user perception in\nthe trading process, assuming constant availability, participation, and full\ncompliance. As a result, these approaches may result in negative attitudes and\nreduced engagement over time. In this paper, we design an automated P2P energy\nmarket that takes user perception into account. We employ prospect theory to\nmodel the user perception and formulate an optimization framework to maximize\nthe buyer's perception while matching demand and production. Given the\nnon-linear and non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we propose\nDifferential Evolution-based Algorithm for Trading Energy called DEbATE.\nAdditionally, we introduce a risk-sensitive Q-learning algorithm, named Pricing\nmechanism with Q-learning and Risk-sensitivity (PQR), which learns the optimal\nprice for sellers considering their perceived utility. Results based on real\ntraces of energy consumption and production, as well as realistic prospect\ntheory functions, show that our approach achieves a 26% higher perceived value\nfor buyers and generates 7% more reward for sellers, compared to a recent state\nof the art approach.",

    "abstract": "Vocoders are models capable of transforming a low-dimensional spectral\nrepresentation of an audio signal, typically the mel spectrogram, to a\nwaveform. Modern speech generation pipelines use a vocoder as their final\ncomponent. Recent vocoder models developed for speech achieve a high degree of\nrealism, such that it is natural to wonder how they would perform on music\nsignals. Compared to speech, the heterogeneity and structure of the musical\nsound texture offers new challenges. In this work we focus on one specific\nartifact that some vocoder models designed for speech tend to exhibit when\napplied to music: the perceived instability of pitch when synthesizing\nsustained notes. We argue that the characteristic sound of this artifact is due\nto the lack of horizontal phase coherence, which is often the result of using a\ntime-domain target space with a model that is invariant to time-shifts, such as\na convolutional neural network. We propose a new vocoder model that is\nspecifically designed for music. Key to improving the pitch stability is the\nchoice of a shift-invariant target space that consists of the magnitude\nspectrum and the phase gradient. We discuss the reasons that inspired us to\nre-formulate the vocoder task, outline a working example, and evaluate it on\nmusical signals.

Recent solutions to video matting have been dominated by\ndeep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the past few years, which have\nbecome the de-facto standard for both academia and industry. However, they have\ninbuilt inductive bias of locality and do not capture global characteristics of\nan image due to the CNN-based architectures. They also lack long-range temporal\nmodeling considering computational costs when dealing with feature maps of\nmultiple frames. In this paper, we propose VMFormer: a transformer-based\nend-to-end method for video matting. It makes predictions on alpha mattes of\neach frame from learnable queries given a video input sequence. Specifically,\nit leverages self-attention layers to build global integration of feature\nsequences with short-range temporal modeling on successive frames. We further\napply queries to learn global representations through cross-attention in the\ntransformer decoder with long-range temporal modeling upon all queries. In the\nprediction stage, both queries and corresponding feature maps are used to make\nthe final prediction of alpha matte. Experiments show that VMFormer outperforms\nprevious CNN-based video matting methods on the composited benchmarks.

To achieve the effect\nof inequality reduction, we interpret the outcome of the elementary game played\nin the network such that the wining of the game is translated into the\nreduction of the inequality. We study different interpretations of the\nintroduced scheme and their impact on the behaviour of agents in the terms of\nthe capital distribution, and we provide examples based on the capital\ndependent Parrondo's paradox. The results presented in this study provide\ninsight into the mechanics of the inequality formation in the society.",

    "title": "Decoding speech from non-invasive brain recordings",
    "abstract": "Decoding language from brain activity is a long-awaited goal in both\nhealthcare and neuroscience. Major milestones have recently been reached thanks\nto intracranial devices: subject-specific pipelines trained on invasive brain\nresponses to basic language tasks now start to efficiently decode interpretable\nfeatures (e.g. letters, words, spectrograms). However, scaling this approach to\nnatural speech and non-invasive brain recordings remains a major challenge.\nHere, we propose a single end-to-end architecture trained with contrastive\nlearning across a large cohort of individuals to predict self-supervised\nrepresentations of natural speech. We evaluate our model on four public\ndatasets, encompassing 169 volunteers recorded with magneto- or\nelectro-encephalography (M/EEG), while they listened to natural speech. The\nresults show that our model can identify, from 3s of MEG signals, the\ncorresponding speech segment with up to 72.5% top-10 accuracy out of 1,594\ndistinct segments (and 44% top-1 accuracy), and up to 19.1% out of 2,604\nsegments for EEG recordings -- hence allowing the decoding of phrases absent\nfrom the training set. Model comparison and ablation analyses show that these\nperformances directly benefit from our original design choices, namely the use\nof (i) a contrastive objective, (ii) pretrained representations of speech and\n(iii) a common convolutional architecture simultaneously trained across several\nparticipants. Together, these results delineate a promising path to decode\nnatural language processing in real time from non-invasive recordings of brain\nactivity.",

Classical experience replay\nallows agents to remember by reusing historical observations. However, the\nuniform reuse strategy that treats all observations equally overlooks the\nrelative importance of different samples. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose a general variance reduction based experience replay (VRER) framework\nthat can selectively reuse the most relevant samples to improve policy gradient\nestimation. This selective mechanism can adaptively put more weight on past\nsamples that are more likely to be generated by the current target\ndistribution. Our theoretical and empirical studies show that the proposed VRER\ncan accelerate the learning of optimal policy and enhance the performance of\nstate-of-the-art policy optimization approaches.",

    "abstract": "The contributions of this thesis stem from technology developed to analyse\nlarge sets of volumetric images in terms of atom-like features extracted in 3D\nimage space, following SIFT algorithm in 2D image space. New feature properties\nare introduced including a binary feature sign, analogous to an electrical\ncharge, and a discrete set of symmetric feature orientation states in 3D space.\nThese new properties are leveraged to extend feature invariance to include the\nsign inversion and parity (SP) transform, analogous to the charge conjugation\nand parity (CP) transform between a particle and its antiparticle in quantum\nmechanics, thereby accounting for local intensity contrast inversion between\nimaging modalities and axis reflections due to shape symmetry. A novel\nexponential kernel is proposed to quantify the similarity of a pair of features\nextracted in different images from their properties including location, scale,\norientation, sign and appearance. A novel measure entitled the soft Jaccard is\nproposed to quantify the similarity of a pair of feature sets based on their\noverlap or intersection-over-union, where a kernel establishes non-binary or\nsoft equivalence between a pair of feature elements. The soft Jaccard may be\nused to identify pairs of feature sets extracted from the same individuals or\nfamilies with high accuracy, and a simple distance threshold led to the\nsurprising discovery of previously unknown individual and family labeling\nerrors in major public neuroimage datasets. A new algorithm is proposed to\nregister or spatially align a pair of feature sets, entitled SIFT Coherent\nPoint Drift (SIFT-CPD), by identifying a transform that maximizes the soft\nJaccard between a fixed feature set and a transformed set. SIFT-CPD achieves\nfaster and more accurate registration than the original CPD algorithm based on\nfeature location information alone, in a variety of challenging.",

    "abstract": "Assume that Alice can do only classical probabilistic polynomial-time\ncomputing while Bob can do quantum polynomial-time computing. Alice and Bob\ncommunicate over only classical channels, and finally Bob gets a state\n$|x_0\\rangle+|x_1\\rangle$ with some bit strings $x_0$ and $x_1$. Is it possible\nthat Alice can know $\\{x_0,x_1\\}$ but Bob cannot? Such a task, called {\\it\nremote state preparations}, is indeed possible under some complexity\nassumptions, and is bases of many quantum cryptographic primitives such as\nproofs of quantumness, (classical-client) blind quantum computing, (classical)\nverifications of quantum computing, and quantum money. A typical technique to\nrealize remote state preparations is to use 2-to-1 trapdoor collision resistant\nhash functions: Alice sends a 2-to-1 trapdoor collision resistant hash function\n$f$ to Bob, and Bob evaluates it on superposition and measures the image. Bob's\npost-measurement state is $|x_0\\rangle+|x_1\\rangle$, where $f(x_0)=f(x_1)=y$.\nWith the trapdoor, Alice can learn $\\{x_0,x_1\\}$, but due to the collision\nresistance, Bob cannot. This Alice's advantage can be leveraged to realize the\nquantum cryptographic primitives listed above. It seems that the collision\nresistance is essential here. In this paper, surprisingly, we show that the\ncollision resistance is not necessary for a restricted case: we show that\n(non-verifiable) remote state preparations of $|x_0\\rangle+|x_1\\rangle$ secure\nagainst {\\it classical} probabilistic polynomial-time Bob can be constructed\nfrom classically-secure (full-domain) trapdoor permutations. Trapdoor\npermutations are not likely to imply the collision resistance, because\nblack-box reductions from collision-resistant hash functions to trapdoor\npermutations are known to be impossible.

This puts even more real-world applications into the reach of optimizers.\nAt the same time, solving optimization problems often turns out to be one of\nthe smaller difficulties when putting solutions into practice. One major\nbarrier is that the optimization software can be perceived as a black box,\nwhich may produce solutions of high quality, but can create completely\ndifferent solutions when circumstances change leading to low acceptance of\noptimized solutions. Such issues of interpretability and explainability have\nseen significant attention in other areas, such as machine learning, but less\nso in optimization. In this paper we propose an optimization framework to\nderive solutions that inherently come with an easily comprehensible explanatory\nrule, under which circumstances which solution should be chosen. Focussing on\ndecision trees to represent explanatory rules, we propose integer programming\nformulations as well as a heuristic method that ensure applicability of our\napproach even for large-scale problems.

Yet, existing methodologies fail\nto cope with the volatile nature of the emerging DAs. Many models have been\nproposed to address the unorthodox market dynamics and frequent disruptions in\nthe microstructure caused by the non-stationarity, and peculiar statistics, in\nDA markets. However, they are either prone to the curse of dimensionality, as\nadditional complexity is required to employ traditional theories, or they\noverfit historical patterns that may never repeat. Instead, we leverage recent\nadvances in market regime (MR) clustering with the Implied Stochastic\nVolatility Model (ISVM). Time-regime clustering is a temporal clustering\nmethod, that clusters the historic evolution of a market into different\nvolatility periods accounting for non-stationarity. ISVM can incorporate\ninvestor expectations in each of the sentiment-driven periods by using implied\nvolatility (IV) data. In this paper, we applied this integrated time-regime\nclustering and ISVM method (termed MR-ISVM) to high-frequency data on BTC\noptions at the popular trading platform Deribit.

    "abstract": "Random forest (RF) regression model is used to predict the lattice constant,\nmagnetic moment and formation energies of full Heusler alloys, half Heusler\nalloys, inverse Heusler alloys and quaternary Heusler alloys based on existing\nas well as indigenously prepared databases. Prior analysis was carried out to\ncheck the distribution of the data points of the response variables and found\nthat in most of the cases, the data is not normally distributed. The outcome of\nthe RF model performance is sufficiently accurate to predict the response\nvariables on the test data and also shows its robustness against overfitting,\noutliers, multicollinearity and distribution of data points. The parity plots\nbetween the machine learning predicted values against the computed values using\ndensity functional theory (DFT) shows linear behavior with adjusted R2 values\nlying in the range of 0.80 to 0.94 for all the predicted properties for\ndifferent types of Heusler alloys. Feature importance analysis shows that the\nvalence electron numbers plays an important feature role in the prediction for\nmost of the predicted outcomes. Case studies with one full Heusler alloy and\none quaternary Heusler alloy were also mentioned comparing the machine learning\npredicted results with our earlier theoretical calculated values and\nexperimentally measured results, suggesting high accuracy of the model\npredicted results.",

Stochastic modelling\nenables us to understand and predict the behaviour of such systems, cementing\nits utility across the quantitative sciences. Accurate models of highly\nnon-Markovian processes -- where the future behaviour depends on events that\nhappened far in the past -- must track copious amounts of information about\npast observations, requiring high-dimensional memories. Quantum technologies\ncan ameliorate this cost, allowing models of the same processes with lower\nmemory dimension than corresponding classical models. Here we implement such\nmemory-efficient quantum models for a family of non-Markovian processes using a\nphotonic setup. We show that with a single qubit of memory our implemented\nquantum models can attain higher precision than possible with any classical\nmodel of the same memory dimension. This heralds a key step towards applying\nquantum technologies in complex systems modelling.",

    "title": "Causal Bandits for Linear Structural Equation Models",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of designing an optimal sequence of\ninterventions in a causal graphical model to minimize the cumulative regret\nwith respect to the best intervention in hindsight. This is, naturally, posed\nas a causal bandit problem. The focus is on causal bandits for linear\nstructural equation models (SEMs) and soft interventions. It is assumed that\nthe graph's structure is known, and it has $N$ nodes. Two linear mechanisms,\none soft intervention and one observational, are assumed for each node, giving\nrise to $2^N$ possible interventions. The existing causal bandit algorithms\nassume that at least the interventional distributions of the reward node's\nparents are fully specified. However, there are $2^N$ such distributions (one\ncorresponding to each intervention), acquiring which becomes prohibitive even\nin moderate-sized graphs. This paper dispenses with the assumption of knowing\nthese distributions. Two algorithms are proposed for the frequentist\n(UCB-based) and Bayesian (Thompson Sampling-based) settings. The key idea of\nthese algorithms is to avoid directly estimating the $2^N$ reward distributions\nand instead estimate the parameters that fully specify the SEMs (linear in $N$)\nand use them to compute the rewards. In both algorithms, under boundedness\nassumptions on noise and the parameter space, the cumulative regrets scale as\n$\\tilde{\\cal O} ((2d)^L L \\sqrt{T})$, where $d$ is the graph's maximum degree,\nand $L$ is the length of its longest causal path.",

From a methodological point of view, we avoid altogether functional\ninequality arguments (as we allow for non-constant non-bounded diffusion maps).\nThe scheme attains, in stepsize, a near-optimal classical (path-space) root\nmean-square error rate of $1/2-\\varepsilon$ for $\\varepsilon>0$ and an optimal\nrate $1/2$ in the non-path-space mean-square error metric.

    "abstract": "Traditional models of opinion dynamics, in which nodes in a network change\ntheir opinions based on their interactions with neighboring nodes, consider how\nopinions evolve either on time-independent networks or on temporal networks\nwith edges that follow Poisson statistics. Most such models are Markovian. In\nmany real-life networks, interactions between individuals (and hence the edges\nin a network) follow non-Poisson processes, which leads to dynamics on networks\nwith memory-dependent effects. In this paper, we model opinion dynamics in\nwhich the entities of a network interact and change their opinions via a\nrandom-walk process. When the walkers have non-Poisson interevent statistics,\nthe corresponding opinion models yield non-Markovian dynamics. We derive an\nopinion model that is governed by an arbitrary waiting-time distribution (WTD)\nand illustrate a variety of induced opinion models from common WTDs (including\nDirac delta, exponential, and heavy-tailed distributions). We analyze the\nconvergence to consensus of these models and prove that homogeneous\nhistory-dependent models of opinion dynamics in our framework always converge\nto the same steady state regardless of the WTD. We also conduct a numerical\ninvestigation of the effects of waiting-time distributions on both transient\ndynamics and steady states. We observe that models that are induced by\nheavy-tailed WTDs converge to a steady state more slowly than those with light\ntails (or with compact support) and that entities with larger waiting times\nexert a larger influence on the mean opinion at steady states.",
