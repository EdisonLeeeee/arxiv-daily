    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have provided new and accurate methods\nfor processing digital images and videos. Yet, training CNNs is extremely\ndemanding in terms of computational resources. Also, for specific applications,\nthe standard use of transfer learning also tends to require far more resources\nthan what may be needed. Furthermore, the final systems tend to operate as\nblack boxes that are difficult to interpret. The current thesis considers the\nproblem of detecting faces from the AOLME video dataset. The AOLME dataset\nconsists of a large video collection of group interactions that are recorded in\nunconstrained classroom environments. For the thesis, still image frames were\nextracted at every minute from 18 24-minute videos. Then, each video frame was\ndivided into 9x5 blocks with 50x50 pixels each. For each of the 19440 blocks,\nthe percentage of face pixels was set as ground truth. Face detection was then\ndefined as a regression problem for determining the face pixel percentage for\neach block. For testing different methods, 12 videos were used for training and\nvalidation. The remaining 6 videos were used for testing. The thesis examines\nthe impact of using the instantaneous phase for the AOLME block-based face\ndetection application. For comparison, the thesis compares the use of the\nFrequency Modulation image based on the instantaneous phase, the use of the\ninstantaneous amplitude, and the original gray scale image. To generate the FM\nand AM inputs, the thesis uses dominant component analysis that aims to\ndecrease the training overhead while maintaining interpretability.",

However, many research endeavors have\nbeen focused on developing practical MARL algorithms whose effectiveness has\nbeen studied only empirically, thereby lacking theoretical guarantees. As\nrecent studies have revealed, MARL methods often achieve performance that is\nunstable in terms of reward monotonicity or suboptimal at convergence. To\nresolve these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework named\nHeterogeneous-Agent Mirror Learning (HAML) that provides a general template for\nMARL algorithmic designs. We prove that algorithms derived from the HAML\ntemplate satisfy the desired properties of the monotonic improvement of the\njoint reward and the convergence to Nash equilibrium. We verify the\npracticality of HAML by proving that the current state-of-the-art cooperative\nMARL algorithms, HATRPO and HAPPO, are in fact HAML instances. Next, as a\nnatural outcome of our theory, we propose HAML extensions of two well-known RL\nalgorithms, HAA2C (for A2C) and HADDPG (for DDPG), and demonstrate their\neffectiveness against strong baselines on StarCraftII and Multi-Agent MuJoCo\ntasks.",

This suggests graph networks may not be fully\nleveraging these underlying similarities. Here we investigate a potential\nexplanation for this phenomenon: the curvature of each property's loss surface\nsignificantly varies, leading to inefficient learning. This difference in\ncurvature can be assessed by looking at spectral properties of the Hessians of\neach property's loss function, which is done in a matrix-free manner via\nrandomized numerical linear algebra.

The principal idea is to\nfit the Loop subdivision surface not directly to the point cloud, but to the\nIMLS (implicit moving least squares) surface defined over the point cloud. As\nboth Loop subdivision and IMLS have analytical expressions, we are able to\nformulate the problem as an unconstrained minimization problem of a completely\ndifferentiable function that can be solved with standard numerical solvers.\nDifferentiability enables us to integrate the subdivision surface into any deep\nlearning method for point clouds or meshes.

    "abstract": "Motivation. Digital commons is an emerging phenomenon and of increasing\nimportance, as we enter a digital society. Open data is one example that makes\nup a pivotal input and foundation for many of today's digital services and\napplications. Ensuring sustainable provisioning and maintenance of the data,\ntherefore, becomes even more important. Aim. We aim to investigate how such\nprovisioning and maintenance can be collaboratively performed in the community\nsurrounding a common. Specifically, we look at Open Data Ecosystems (ODEs), a\ntype of community of actors, openly sharing and evolving data on a\ntechnological platform. Method. We use Elinor Ostrom's design principles for\nCommon Pool Resources as a lens to systematically analyze the governance of\nearlier reported cases of ODEs using a theory-oriented software engineering\nframework. Results. We find that, while natural commons must regulate\nconsumption, digital commons such as open data maintained by an ODE must\nstimulate both use and data provisioning. Governance needs to enable such\nstimulus while also ensuring that the collective action can still be\ncoordinated and managed within the frame of available maintenance resources of\na community. Subtractability is, in this sense, a concern regarding the\nresources required to maintain the quality and value of the data, rather than\nthe availability of data. Further, we derive empirically-based recommended\npractices for ODEs based on the design principles by Ostrom for how to design a\ngovernance structure in a way that enables a sustainable and collaborative\nprovisioning and maintenance of the data. Conclusion. ODEs are expected to play\na role in data provisioning which democratize the digital society and enables\ninnovation from smaller commercial actors.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems have become the dominant means of curating cultural\ncontent, significantly influencing the nature of individual cultural\nexperience. While the majority of research on recommender systems optimizes for\npersonalized user experience, this paradigm does not capture the ways that\nrecommender systems impact cultural experience in the aggregate, across\npopulations of users. Although existing novelty, diversity, and fairness\nstudies probe how systems relate to the broader social role of cultural\ncontent, they do not adequately center culture as a core concept and challenge.\nIn this work, we introduce commonality as a new measure that reflects the\ndegree to which recommendations familiarize a given user population with\nspecified categories of cultural content. Our proposed commonality metric\nresponds to a set of arguments developed through an interdisciplinary dialogue\nbetween researchers in computer science and the social sciences and humanities.\nWith reference to principles underpinning non-profit, public service media\nsystems in democratic societies, we identify universality of address and\ncontent diversity in the service of strengthening cultural citizenship as\nparticularly relevant goals for recommender systems delivering cultural\ncontent. Taking diversity in movie recommendation as a case study in enhancing\npluralistic cultural experience, we empirically compare systems' performance\nusing commonality and existing utility, diversity, and fairness metrics. Our\nresults demonstrate that commonality captures a property of system behavior\ncomplementary to existing metrics and suggest the need for alternative,\nnon-personalized interventions in recommender systems oriented to strengthening\ncultural citizenship across populations of users. In this way, commonality\ncontributes to a growing body of scholarship developing 'public good'\nrationales for digital media and ML systems.",

    "abstract": "In many applications, multiple parties have private data regarding the same\nset of users but on disjoint sets of attributes, and a server wants to leverage\nthe data to train a model. To enable model learning while protecting the\nprivacy of the data subjects, we need vertical federated learning (VFL)\ntechniques, where the data parties share only information for training the\nmodel, instead of the private data. However, it is challenging to ensure that\nthe shared information maintains privacy while learning accurate models. To the\nbest of our knowledge, the algorithm proposed in this paper is the first\npractical solution for differentially private vertical federated k-means\nclustering, where the server can obtain a set of global centers with a provable\ndifferential privacy guarantee. Our algorithm assumes an untrusted central\nserver that aggregates differentially private local centers and membership\nencodings from local data parties. It builds a weighted grid as the synopsis of\nthe global dataset based on the received information. Final centers are\ngenerated by running any k-means algorithm on the weighted grid. Our approach\nfor grid weight estimation uses a novel, light-weight, and differentially\nprivate set intersection cardinality estimation algorithm based on the\nFlajolet-Martin sketch. To improve the estimation accuracy in the setting with\nmore than two data parties, we further propose a refined version of the weights\nestimation algorithm and a parameter tuning strategy to reduce the final\nk-means utility to be close to that in the central private setting. We provide\ntheoretical utility analysis and experimental evaluation results for the\ncluster centers computed by our algorithm and show that our approach performs\nbetter both theoretically and empirically than the two baselines based on\nexisting techniques.",

    "abstract": "We take a divide and conquer approach to design controllers for reachability\nproblems given large-scale linear systems with polyhedral constraints on\nstates, controls, and disturbances. Such systems are made of small subsystems\nwith coupled dynamics. We treat the couplings as additional disturbances and\nuse assume-guarantee (AG) contracts to characterize these disturbance sets. For\neach subsystem, we design and implement a robust controller locally, subject to\nits own constraints and contracts. The main contribution of this paper is a\nmethod to derive the contracts via a novel parameterization and a corresponding\npotential function that characterizes the distance to the correct composition\nof controllers and contracts, where all contracts are held.

    "abstract": "The Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) will advance the operational\neffectiveness of infantry units. However, this requires autonomous assets such\nas sensors, drones, combat equipment, and uncrewed vehicles to collaborate,\nsecurely share information, and be resilient to adversary attacks in contested\nmulti-domain operations. CAPD addresses this problem by providing a\ncontext-aware, policy-driven framework supporting data and knowledge exchange\namong autonomous entities in a battlespace. We propose an IoBT ontology that\nfacilitates controlled information sharing to enable semantic interoperability\nbetween systems. Its key contributions include providing a knowledge graph with\na shared semantic schema, integration with background knowledge, efficient\nmechanisms for enforcing data consistency and drawing inferences, and\nsupporting attribute-based access control. The sensors in the IoBT provide data\nthat create populated knowledge graphs based on the ontology. This paper\ndescribes using CAPD to detect and mitigate adversary actions. CAPD enables\nsituational awareness using reasoning over the sensed data and SPARQL queries.\nFor example, adversaries can cause sensor failure or hijacking and disrupt the\ntactical networks to degrade video surveillance. In such instances, CAPD uses\nan ontology-based reasoner to see how alternative approaches can still support\nthe mission. Depending on bandwidth availability, the reasoner initiates the\ncreation of a reduced frame rate grayscale video by active transcoding or\ntransmits only still images. This ability to reason over the mission sensed\nenvironment and attack context permits the autonomous IoBT system to exhibit\nresilience in contested conditions.",

    "abstract": "To create a large amount of training labels for machine learning models\neffectively and efficiently, researchers have turned to Weak Supervision (WS),\nwhich uses programmatic labeling sources rather than manual annotation.\nExisting works of WS for binary classification typically assume the presence of\nlabeling sources that are able to assign both positive and negative labels to\ndata in roughly balanced proportions. However, for many tasks of interest where\nthere is a minority positive class, negative examples could be too diverse for\ndevelopers to generate indicative labeling sources. Thus, in this work, we\nstudy the application of WS on binary classification tasks with positive\nlabeling sources only. We propose WEAPO, a simple yet competitive WS method for\nproducing training labels without negative labeling sources.

    "abstract": "Implicit feedback is frequently used for developing personalized\nrecommendation services due to its ubiquity and accessibility in real-world\nsystems. In order to effectively utilize such information, most research adopts\nthe pairwise ranking method on constructed training triplets (user, positive\nitem, negative item) and aims to distinguish between positive items and\nnegative items for each user. However, most of these methods treat all the\ntraining triplets equally, which ignores the subtle difference between\ndifferent positive or negative items. On the other hand, even though some other\nworks make use of the auxiliary information (e.g., dwell time) of user\nbehaviors to capture this subtle difference, such auxiliary information is hard\nto obtain. To mitigate the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel training\nframework named Triplet Importance Learning (TIL), which adaptively learns the\nimportance score of training triplets. We devise two strategies for the\nimportance score generation and formulate the whole procedure as a bilevel\noptimization, which does not require any rule-based design. We integrate the\nproposed training procedure with several Matrix Factorization (MF)- and Graph\nNeural Network (GNN)-based recommendation models, demonstrating the\ncompatibility of our framework. Via a comparison using three real-world\ndatasets with many state-of-the-art methods, we show that our proposed method\noutperforms the best existing models by 3-21\\% in terms of Recall@k for the\ntop-k recommendation.",

In particular, the setup consists\nof a source node communicating with a destination node via a regenerative\nrelay. In this setup, a RIS is installed in each hop to increase the\nsource-relay and relay-destination communications reliability, where the RISs'\nphase shifts are subject to quantization errors. The legitimate transmission is\nperformed under the presence of a malicious eavesdropper attempting to\ncompromise the legitimate transmissions by overhearing the broadcasted signal\nfrom the relay. To overcome this problem, we incorporate a jammer to increase\nthe system's secrecy by disrupting the eavesdropper through a broadcasted\njamming signal. Leveraging the well-adopted Gamma and Exponential distributions\napproximations, the system's secrecy level is quantified by deriving\napproximate and asymptotic expressions of the secrecy intercept probability\n(IP) metric in terms of the main network parameters. The results show that the\nsecrecy is enhanced significantly by increasing the jamming power and/or the\nnumber of reflective elements (REs). In particular, an IP of approximately\n$10^{-4}$ can be reached with $40$ REs and $10$ dB of jamming power-to-noise\nratio even when the legitimate links' average signal-to-noise ratios are\n$10$-dB less than the eavesdropper's one. We show that cooperative jamming is\nvery helpful in strong eavesdropping scenarios with a fixed number of REs, and\nthe number of quantization bits does not influence the secrecy when exceeding\n$3$ bits.

Following the human perception,\noverlapping semantic linkages between two named entities become clear due to\nour common-sense about the context a relationship lives in which is not the\ncase when we look at it from an automatically driven process of a machine. In\nthis work, we are interested in the problem of Relational Resolution within the\nscope of KGs, i.e, we are investigating the inherent semantic of relationships\nbetween entities within a network. We propose a new adaptive AutoEncoder,\ncalled V-Coder, to identify relations inherently connecting entities from\ndifferent domains.

The evaluation on real-world datasets of\nFreebase, Yago and NELL shows that the V-Coder is not only able to recover\nlinks from corrupted input data, but also shows that the semantic disclosure of\nrelations in a KG show the tendency to improve link prediction.

    "abstract": "Present air traffic complexity metrics are defined considering the interests\nof different management layers of ATM. These layers have different objectives\nwhich in practice compete to maximize their own goals, which leads to\nfragmented decision making. This fragmentation together with competing KPAs\nrequires transparent and neutral air traffic information to pave the way for an\nexplainable set of actions. In this paper, we introduce the concept of single\naircraft complexity, to determine the contribution of each aircraft to the\noverall complexity of air traffic. Furthermore, we describe a methodology\nextending this concept to define complex communities, which are groups of\ninterdependent aircraft that contribute the majority of the complexity in a\ncertain airspace. In order to showcase the methodology, a tool that visualizes\ndifferent outputs of the algorithm is developed. Through use-cases based on\nsynthetic and real historical traffic, we first show that the algorithm can\nserve to formalize controller decisions as well as guide controllers to better\ndecisions. Further, we investigate how the provided information can be used to\nincrease transparency of the decision makers towards different airspace users,\nwhich serves also to increase fairness and equity. Lastly, a sensitivity\nanalysis is conducted in order to systematically analyse how each input affects\nthe methodology.",

The public sector has thus far mainly focused on the sharing of\nOpen Government Data (OGD), often with a supply-driven approach with limited\nfeedback-loops. We hypothesize that public sector organizations can extend the\nopen innovation benefits by also creating platforms, where OGD, related OSS,\nand open standards are collaboratively developed and shared. Objective: The\nobjective of this study is to explore how public sector organizations in the\nrole of platform providers facilitate such collaboration in the form of OGD\necosystems and how the ecosystem's governance may be structured to support the\ncollaboration. Method: We conduct an exploratory multiple-case study of two\nsuch ecosystems, focused on OGD related to the Swedish labor market and public\ntransport sector, respectively. Data is gathered through interviews, document\nstudies, and prolonged engagement at one of the platform providers. Results:\nThe study presents governance structure and collaboration practices of the two\necosystems and discusses how these contribute to the platform providers' goals.\nThe case studies highlight the need for platform providers to take an active\nand multi-functional role in enabling the sharing of data and software from and\nbetween the members of the ecosystem.

Accounting to the potential unreliable\nwireless channels due to the impurities of the propagation environments, such\nas deep fading, blockages, etc., multiple RISs are deployed in the considered\nIoT network to mitigate the propagation-induced impairments, to enhance the\nquality of the wireless links, and to ensure that the required freshness of\ninformation is achieved. In this setup, an optimization problem has been\nformulated to minimize the average sum Age of Information (AoI) by optimizing\nthe transmit power of the IoTDs, the IoTDs clustering policy, and the RISs\nconfigurations. The formulated problem ends up to be a mixed-integer non-convex\nproblem. In order to tackle this challenge, the RISs configurations are first\nobtained by adopting a semi-definite relaxation (SDR) approach. Then, the joint\npower allocation and user-clustering problem is solved using the concept of\nbi-level optimization, where the original problem is decomposed into an outer\nIoTDs clustering problem and an inner power allocation problem. Optimal\nclosed-form expressions are derived for the inner problem and the Hungarian\nmethod is invoked to solve the outer problem.

In this work, we employ a dataset consisting of two components:\n(1) relevance of a document to a query and (2) \"gender\" of a document, in which\npronouns are replaced by male, female, and neutral conjugations. We\ndefinitively show that pre-trained models for IR do not perform well in\nzero-shot retrieval tasks when full fine-tuning of a large pre-trained BERT\nencoder is performed and that lightweight fine-tuning performed with adapter\nnetworks improves zero-shot retrieval performance almost by 20% over baseline.\nWe also illustrate that pre-trained models have gender biases that result in\nretrieved articles tending to be more often male than female.

    "abstract": "Efficiently exploiting multi-modal inputs for accurate RGB-D saliency\ndetection is a topic of high interest. Most existing works leverage cross-modal\ninteractions to fuse the two streams of RGB-D for intermediate features'\nenhancement. In this process, a practical aspect of the low quality of the\navailable depths has not been fully considered yet. In this work, we aim for\nRGB-D saliency detection that is robust to the low-quality depths which\nprimarily appear in two forms: inaccuracy due to noise and the misalignment to\nRGB. To this end, we propose a robust RGB-D fusion method that benefits from\n(1) layer-wise, and (2) trident spatial, attention mechanisms. On the one hand,\nlayer-wise attention (LWA) learns the trade-off between early and late fusion\nof RGB and depth features, depending upon the depth accuracy. On the other\nhand, trident spatial attention (TSA) aggregates the features from a wider\nspatial context to address the depth misalignment problem. The proposed LWA and\nTSA mechanisms allow us to efficiently exploit the multi-modal inputs for\nsaliency detection while being robust against low-quality depths. Our\nexperiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed fusion\nmethod performs consistently better than the state-of-the-art fusion\nalternatives.",

    "title": "Striking a Balance: Reader Takeaways and Preferences when Integrating  Text and Charts",
    "abstract": "While visualizations are an effective way to represent insights about\ninformation, they rarely stand alone. When designing a visualization, text is\noften added to provide additional context and guidance for the reader. However,\nthere is little experimental evidence to guide designers as to what is the\nright amount of text to show within a chart, what its qualitative properties\nshould be, and where it should be placed. Prior work also shows variation in\npersonal preferences for charts versus textual representations. In this paper,\nwe explore several research questions about the relative value of textual\ncomponents of visualizations. 302 participants ranked univariate line charts\ncontaining varying amounts of text, ranging from no text (except for the axes)\nto a written paragraph with no visuals. Participants also described what\ninformation they could take away from line charts containing text with varying\nsemantic content. We find that heavily annotated charts were not penalized. In\nfact, participants preferred the charts with the largest number of textual\nannotations over charts with fewer annotations or text alone. We also find\neffects of semantic content. For instance, the text that describes statistical\nor relational components of a chart leads to more takeaways referring to\nstatistics or relational comparisons than text describing elemental or encoded\ncomponents. Finally, we find different effects for the semantic levels based on\nthe placement of the text on the chart; some kinds of information are best\nplaced in the title, while others should be placed closer to the data. We\ncompile these results into four chart design guidelines and discuss future\nimplications for the combination of text and charts.",

    "abstract": "Task scheduling is a critical problem when one user offloads multiple\ndifferent tasks to the edge server. When a user has multiple tasks to offload\nand only one task can be transmitted to server at a time, while server\nprocesses tasks according to the transmission order, the problem is NP-hard.\nHowever, it is difficult for traditional optimization methods to quickly obtain\nthe optimal solution, while approaches based on reinforcement learning face\nwith the challenge of excessively large action space and slow convergence. In\nthis paper, we propose a Digital Twin (DT)-assisted RL-based task scheduling\nmethod in order to improve the performance and convergence of the RL. We use DT\nto simulate the results of different decisions made by the agent, so that one\nagent can try multiple actions at a time, or, similarly, multiple agents can\ninteract with environment in parallel in DT. In this way, the exploration\nefficiency of RL can be significantly improved via DT, and thus RL can\nconverges faster and local optimality is less likely to happen. Particularly,\ntwo algorithms are designed to made task scheduling decisions, i.e.,\nDT-assisted asynchronous Q-learning (DTAQL) and DT-assisted exploring\nQ-learning (DTEQL). Simulation results show that both algorithms significantly\nimprove the convergence speed of Q-learning by increasing the exploration\nefficiency.",

For this\nreason, redundant measuring data are used to train the diagnostic model,\nleading to high uncertainty of the classification, extra training time\nconsumption, and higher probability of overfitting while training. In this\nstudy, a method of choosing thermal hydraulics parameters of a nuclear power\nplant is proposed, using the theory of post-hoc interpretability theory in deep\nlearning. At the start, a novel Time-sequential Residual Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (TRES-CNN) diagnosis model is introduced to identify the position and\nhydrodynamic diameter of breaks in LOCA, using 38 parameters manually chosen on\nHPR1000 empirically. Afterwards, post-hoc interpretability methods are applied\nto evaluate the attributions of diagnosis model's outputs, deciding which 15\nparameters to be more decisive in diagnosing LOCA details. The results show\nthat the TRES-CNN based diagnostic model successfully predicts the position and\nsize of breaks in LOCA via selected 15 parameters of HPR1000, with 25% of time\nconsumption while training the model compared the process using total 38\nparameters. In addition, the relative diagnostic accuracy error is within 1.5\npercent compared with the model using parameters chosen empirically, which can\nbe regarded as the same amount of diagnostic reliability.",

    "abstract": "For a monocular 360 image, depth estimation is a challenging because the\ndistortion increases along the latitude. To perceive the distortion, existing\nmethods devote to designing a deep and complex network architecture. In this\npaper, we provide a new perspective that constructs an interpretable and sparse\nrepresentation for a 360 image. Considering the importance of the geometric\nstructure in depth estimation, we utilize the contourlet transform to capture\nan explicit geometric cue in the spectral domain and integrate it with an\nimplicit cue in the spatial domain. Specifically, we propose a neural\ncontourlet network consisting of a convolutional neural network and a\ncontourlet transform branch. In the encoder stage, we design a spatial-spectral\nfusion module to effectively fuse two types of cues.

    "abstract": "Node injection attacks against Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received\nemerging attention as a practical attack scenario, where the attacker injects\nmalicious nodes instead of modifying node features or edges to degrade the\nperformance of GNNs. Despite the initial success of node injection attacks, we\nfind that the injected nodes by existing methods are easy to be distinguished\nfrom the original normal nodes by defense methods and limiting their attack\nperformance in practice. To solve the above issues, we devote to camouflage\nnode injection attack, i.e., camouflaging injected malicious nodes\n(structure/attributes) as the normal ones that appear legitimate/imperceptible\nto defense methods. The non-Euclidean nature of graph data and the lack of\nhuman prior brings great challenges to the formalization, implementation, and\nevaluation of camouflage on graphs. In this paper, we first propose and\nformulate the camouflage of injected nodes from both the fidelity and diversity\nof the ego networks centered around injected nodes. Then, we design an\nadversarial CAmouflage framework for Node injection Attack, namely CANA, to\nimprove the camouflage while ensuring the attack performance. Several novel\nindicators for graph camouflage are further designed for a comprehensive\nevaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that when equipping existing node\ninjection attack methods with our proposed CANA framework, the attack\nperformance against defense methods as well as node camouflage is significantly\nimproved.",

    "abstract": "Link prediction is an important task that has wide applications in various\ndomains. However, the majority of existing link prediction approaches assume\nthe given graph follows homophily assumption, and designs similarity-based\nheuristics or representation learning approaches to predict links. However,\nmany real-world graphs are heterophilic graphs, where the homophily assumption\ndoes not hold, which challenges existing link prediction methods. Generally, in\nheterophilic graphs, there are many latent factors causing the link formation,\nand two linked nodes tend to be similar in one or two factors but might be\ndissimilar in other factors, leading to low overall similarity. Thus, one way\nis to learn disentangled representation for each node with each vector\ncapturing the latent representation of a node on one factor, which paves a way\nto model the link formation in heterophilic graphs, resulting in better node\nrepresentation learning and link prediction performance. However, the work on\nthis is rather limited. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of\nexploring disentangled representation learning for link prediction on\nheterophilic graphs.

Selecting appropriate transmission parameters, such\nas channel and spreading factor (SF), can effectively reduce the collisions\nbetween long-range (LoRa) devices. However, most of the schemes proposed in the\ncurrent literature are not easy to implement on an IoT device with limited\ncomputational complexity and memory. To solve this issue, we propose a\nlightweight transmission-parameter selection scheme, i.e., a joint channel and\nSF selection scheme using reinforcement learning for low-power wide area\nnetworking (LoRaWAN). In the proposed scheme, appropriate transmission\nparameters can be selected by simple four arithmetic operations using only\nAcknowledge (ACK) information. Additionally, we theoretically analyze the\ncomputational complexity and memory requirement of our proposed scheme, which\nverified that our proposed scheme could select transmission parameters with\nextremely low computational complexity and memory requirement. Moreover, a\nlarge number of experiments were implemented on the LoRa devices in the real\nworld to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. The experimental\nresults demonstrate the following main phenomena. (1) Compared to other\nlightweight transmission-parameter selection schemes, collisions between LoRa\ndevices can be efficiently avoided by our proposed scheme in LoRaWAN\nirrespective of changes in the available channels. (2) The frame success rate\n(FSR) can be improved by selecting access channels and using SFs as opposed to\nonly selecting access channels.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the ever-increasing concerns on personal data privacy and the\nrapidly growing data volume at local clients, federated learning (FL) has\nemerged as a new machine learning setting. An FL system is comprised of a\ncentral parameter server and multiple local clients. It keeps data at local\nclients and learns a centralized model by sharing the model parameters learned\nlocally. No local data needs to be shared, and privacy can be well protected.\nNevertheless, since it is the model instead of the raw data that is shared, the\nsystem can be exposed to the poisoning model attacks launched by malicious\nclients. Furthermore, it is challenging to identify malicious clients since no\nlocal client data is available on the server. Besides, membership inference\nattacks can still be performed by using the uploaded model to estimate the\nclient's local data, leading to privacy disclosure. In this work, we first\npropose a model update based federated averaging algorithm to defend against\nByzantine attacks such as additive noise attacks and sign-flipping attacks. The\nindividual client model initialization method is presented to provide further\nprivacy protections from the membership inference attacks by hiding the\nindividual local machine learning model. When combining these two schemes,\nprivacy and security can be both effectively enhanced. The proposed schemes are\nproved to converge experimentally under non-IID data distribution when there\nare no attacks.

However, there still exist several issues in existing\nDUNs: 1) For each iteration, a simple stacked convolutional network is usually\nadopted, which apparently limits the expressiveness of these models. 2) Once\nthe training is completed, most hyperparameters of existing DUNs are fixed for\nany input content, which significantly weakens their adaptability. In this\npaper, by unfolding the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm\n(FISTA), a novel fast hierarchical DUN, dubbed FHDUN, is proposed for image\ncompressed sensing, in which a well-designed hierarchical unfolding\narchitecture is developed to cooperatively explore richer contextual prior\ninformation in multi-scale spaces. To further enhance the adaptability, series\nof hyperparametric generation networks are developed in our framework to\ndynamically produce the corresponding optimal hyperparameters according to the\ninput content. Furthermore, due to the accelerated policy in FISTA, the newly\nembedded acceleration module makes the proposed FHDUN save more than 50% of the\niterative loops against recent DUNs. Extensive CS experiments manifest that the\nproposed FHDUN outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS methods, while\nmaintaining fewer iterations.",

    "abstract": "Recently, increasing efforts have been focused on Weakly Supervised Scene\nGraph Generation (WSSGG). The mainstream solution for WSSGG typically follows\nthe same pipeline: they first align text entities in the weak image-level\nsupervisions (e.g., unlocalized relation triplets or captions) with image\nregions, and then train SGG models in a fully-supervised manner with aligned\ninstance-level \"pseudo\" labels.

While they neglect\nanother basic requirement for an ideal alignment: interaction-consistency,\nwhich means the grounded region pairs should have the same interactions (i.e.,\nvisual relations) as text entity pairs. Hence, in this paper, we propose to\nenhance a simple grounding module with both object-aware and interaction-aware\nknowledge to acquire more reliable pseudo labels. To better leverage these two\ntypes of knowledge, we regard them as two teachers and fuse their generated\ntargets to guide the training process of our grounding module.

This paper proposed two\nresidual blocks, namely EMC2A blocks with multiscale receptive fields(RFs),\nbased on a multibranch structure and then designed an efficient isotopic\narchitecture deep CNN (DCNN), EMC2A-Net.

To further improve the efficiency of multiscale feature fusion, this\npaper proposed a multiscale feature cross-channel attention module, namely the\nEMC2A module, adopting a local multiscale feature interaction strategy without\ndimensionality reduction. This strategy adaptively adjusts the weights of each\nchannel through efficient one-dimensional (1D)-circular convolution and sigmoid\nfunction to guide attention at the global channel wise level. The comparative\nresults on the MSTAR dataset show that EMC2A-Net outperforms the existing\navailable models of the same type and has relatively lightweight network\nstructure.

    "abstract": "Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is an important data mining task with\nnumerous applications in the IoT era. In recent years, a large number of deep\nneural network-based methods have been proposed, demonstrating significantly\nbetter performance than conventional methods on addressing challenging TSAD\nproblems in a variety of areas. Nevertheless, these deep TSAD methods typically\nrely on a clean training dataset that is not polluted by anomalies to learn the\n\"normal profile\" of the underlying dynamics. This requirement is nontrivial\nsince a clean dataset can hardly be provided in practice. Moreover, without the\nawareness of their robustness, blindly applying deep TSAD methods with\npotentially contaminated training data can possibly incur significant\nperformance degradation in the detection phase. In this work, to tackle this\nimportant challenge, we firstly investigate the robustness of commonly used\ndeep TSAD methods with contaminated training data which provides a guideline\nfor applying these methods when the provided training data are not guaranteed\nto be anomaly-free. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic method which can\neffectively improve the robustness of learning mainstream deep TSAD models with\npotentially contaminated data. Experiment results show that our method can\nconsistently prevent or mitigate performance degradation of mainstream deep\nTSAD models on widely used benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning networks have demonstrated high performance in a large variety\nof applications, such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural\nlanguage processing. However, there exists a major vulnerability exploited by\nthe use of adversarial attacks. An adversarial attack imputes images by\naltering the input image very slightly, making it nearly undetectable to the\nnaked eye, but results in a very different classification by the network. This\npaper explores the projected gradient descent (PGD) attack and the Adaptive\nMask Segmentation Attack (ASMA) on the image segmentation DeepLabV3 model using\ntwo types of architectures: MobileNetV3 and ResNet50, It was found that PGD was\nvery consistent in changing the segmentation to be its target while the\ngeneralization of ASMA to a multiclass target was not as effective. The\nexistence of such attack however puts all of image classification deep learning\nnetworks in danger of exploitation.",

    "abstract": "Multi-types of behaviors (e.g., clicking, adding to cart, purchasing, etc.)\nwidely exist in most real-world recommendation scenarios, which are beneficial\nto learn users' multi-faceted preferences. As dependencies are explicitly\nexhibited by the multiple types of behaviors, effectively modeling complex\nbehavior dependencies is crucial for multi-behavior prediction. The\nstate-of-the-art multi-behavior models learn behavior dependencies\nindistinguishably with all historical interactions as input. However, different\nbehaviors may reflect different aspects of user preference, which means that\nsome irrelevant interactions may play as noises to the target behavior to be\npredicted. To address the aforementioned limitations, we introduce\nmulti-interest learning to the multi-behavior recommendation. More\nspecifically, we propose a novel Coarse-to-fine Knowledge-enhanced\nMulti-interest Learning (CKML) framework to learn shared and behavior-specific\ninterests for different behaviors. CKML introduces two advanced modules, namely\nCoarse-grained Interest Extracting (CIE) and Fine-grained Behavioral\nCorrelation (FBC), which work jointly to capture fine-grained behavioral\ndependencies. CIE uses knowledge-aware information to extract initial\nrepresentations of each interest. FBC incorporates a dynamic routing scheme to\nfurther assign each behavior among interests. Additionally, we use the\nself-attention mechanism to correlate different behavioral information at the\ninterest level. Empirical results on three real-world datasets verify the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our model in exploiting multi-behavior data.\nFurther experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each module and the\nrobustness and superiority of the shared and specific modelling paradigm for\nmulti-behavior data.",

    "abstract": "Lean combustion is environment friendly with low NOx emissions and also\nprovides better fuel efficiency in a combustion system. However, approaching\ntowards lean combustion can make engines more susceptible to lean blowout. Lean\nblowout (LBO) is an undesirable phenomenon that can cause sudden flame\nextinction leading to sudden loss of power. During the design stage, it is\nquite challenging for the scientists to accurately determine the optimal\noperating limits to avoid sudden LBO occurrence. Therefore, it is crucial to\ndevelop accurate and computationally tractable frameworks for online LBO\ndetection in low NOx emission engines. To the best of our knowledge, for the\nfirst time, we propose a deep learning approach to detect lean blowout in\ncombustion systems. In this work, we utilize a laboratory-scale combustor to\ncollect data for different protocols. We start far from LBO for each protocol\nand gradually move towards the LBO regime, capturing a quasi-static time series\ndataset at each condition. Using one of the protocols in our dataset as the\nreference protocol and with conditions annotated by domain experts, we find a\ntransition state metric for our trained deep learning model to detect LBO in\nthe other test protocols.

However, once a region has changed, the\nlocal structure of the image changes, i.e., the connectivity of the vertex\ncontaining this region changes.

These are gradually replacing conventional thermal power plants which\ntoday are the main providers of black start (BS) services. Consequently, in\ncase of a total/partial blackout, conventional black-start resources are not\nready for operation. Offshore wind farms (OWFs), with their large capacity and\nfast controllers, have potential as novel BS units. This new service introduces\na need for a new design for wind power systems to be able to fulfil the black\nstart requirements for non-traditional generation units. In this paper,\nchallenges, and possible solutions in integrating BS services into OWFs will be\npresented. A first challenge is represented by the implementation of a BS unit.\nThe BS unit should be capable of firstly forming the wind farm power island and\nwithstanding transient phenomena due to energisation. There could be several\ndifferent solutions, e.g., the integration of grid-forming converters in the\nwind farm design which could be battery energy storage systems (BESSs). In this\npaper, specific challenges are analysed using simulations on a wind farm\nequipped with a grid-forming BESS, and the proposed solutions discussed.

    "abstract": "Process mining employs event data extracted from different types of\ninformation systems to discover and analyze actual processes. Event data often\ncontain highly sensitive information about the people who carry out activities\nor the people for whom activities are performed. Therefore, privacy concerns in\nprocess mining are receiving increasing attention. To alleviate privacy-related\nrisks, several privacy preservation techniques have been proposed. Differential\nprivacy is one of these techniques which provides strong privacy guarantees.\nHowever, the proposed techniques presume that event data are released in only\none shot, whereas business processes are continuously executed. Hence, event\ndata are published repeatedly, resulting in additional risks. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that continuously released event data are not independent, and the\ncorrelation among different releases can result in privacy degradation when the\nsame differential privacy mechanism is applied to each release. We quantify\nsuch privacy degradation in the form of temporal privacy leakages. We apply\ncontinuous event data publishing scenarios to real-life event logs to\ndemonstrate privacy leakages.",

    "abstract": "Modelling the user's multiple behaviors is an essential part of modern\ne-commerce, whose widely adopted application is to jointly optimize\nclick-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR) predictions. Most of\nexisting methods overlook the effect of two key characteristics of the user's\nbehaviors: for each item list, (i) contextual dependence refers to that the\nuser's behaviors on any item are not purely determinated by the item itself but\nalso are influenced by the user's previous behaviors (e.g., clicks, purchases)\non other items in the same sequence; (ii) multiple time scales means that users\nare likely to click frequently but purchase periodically. To this end, we\ndevelop a new multi-scale user behavior network named Hierarchical rEcurrent\nRanking On the Entire Space (HEROES) which incorporates the contextual\ninformation to estimate the user multiple behaviors in a multi-scale fashion.\nConcretely, we introduce a hierarchical framework, where the lower layer models\nthe user's engagement behaviors while the upper layer estimates the user's\nsatisfaction behaviors. The proposed architecture can automatically learn a\nsuitable time scale for each layer to capture the dynamic user's behavioral\npatterns. Besides the architecture, we also introduce the Hawkes process to\nform a novel recurrent unit which can not only encode the items' features in\nthe context but also formulate the excitation or discouragement from the user's\nprevious behaviors. We further show that HEROES can be extended to build\nunbiased ranking systems through combinations with the survival analysis\ntechnique. Extensive experiments over three large-scale industrial datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our model compared with the state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

However, current methods for training flows either suffer from\nmode-seeking behavior, use samples from the target generated beforehand by\nexpensive MCMC simulations, or use stochastic losses that have very high\nvariance. To avoid these problems, we augment flows with annealed importance\nsampling (AIS) and minimize the mass covering $\\alpha$-divergence with\n$\\alpha=2$, which minimizes importance weight variance. Our method, Flow AIS\nBootstrap (FAB), uses AIS to generate samples in regions where the flow is a\npoor approximation of the target, facilitating the discovery of new modes. We\ntarget with AIS the minimum variance distribution for the estimation of the\n$\\alpha$-divergence via importance sampling. We also use a prioritized buffer\nto store and reuse AIS samples. These two features significantly improve FAB's\nperformance. We apply FAB to complex multimodal targets and show that we can\napproximate them very accurately where previous methods fail. To the best of\nour knowledge, we are the first to learn the Boltzmann distribution of the\nalanine dipeptide molecule using only the unnormalized target density and\nwithout access to samples generated via Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations:\nFAB produces better results than training via maximum likelihood on MD samples\nwhile using 100 times fewer target evaluations.

The seen classes can be seen as an implicit criterion of\nclasses, which makes this setting different from unsupervised clustering where\nthe cluster criteria may be ambiguous. We mainly concern the problem of\ndiscovering categories within a fine-grained dataset since it is one of the\nmost direct applications of category discovery, i.e. helping experts discover\nnovel concepts within an unlabeled dataset using the implicit criterion set\nforth by the seen classes. State-of-the-art methods for generalized category\ndiscovery leverage contrastive learning to learn the representations, but the\nlarge inter-class similarity and intra-class variance pose a challenge for the\nmethods because the negative examples may contain irrelevant cues for\nrecognizing a category so the algorithms may converge to a local-minima.

    "abstract": "Imitation learning learns a policy from expert trajectories. While the expert\ndata is believed to be crucial for imitation quality, it was found that a kind\nof imitation learning approach, adversarial imitation learning (AIL), can have\nexceptional performance. With as little as only one expert trajectory, AIL can\nmatch the expert performance even in a long horizon, on tasks such as\nlocomotion control. There are two mysterious points in this phenomenon. First,\nwhy can AIL perform well with only a few expert trajectories? Second, why does\nAIL maintain good performance despite the length of the planning horizon? In\nthis paper, we theoretically explore these two questions. For a\ntotal-variation-distance-based AIL (called TV-AIL), our analysis shows a\nhorizon-free imitation gap $\\mathcal O(\\{\\min\\{1, \\sqrt{|\\mathcal S|/N} \\})$ on\na class of instances abstracted from locomotion control tasks. Here $|\\mathcal\nS|$ is the state space size for a tabular Markov decision process, and $N$ is\nthe number of expert trajectories. We emphasize two important features of our\nbound. First, this bound is meaningful in both small and large sample regimes.\nSecond, this bound suggests that the imitation gap of TV-AIL is at most 1\nregardless of the planning horizon.

Due to the limited computing capability, vehicles\nusually transmit data to a road side unit (RSU) at the network edge to process\ndata. However, vehicles are usually reluctant to share data with each other due\nto the privacy issue. For the traditional federated learning (FL), vehicles\ntrain the data locally to obtain a local model and then upload the local model\nto the RSU to update the global model, thus the data privacy can be protected\nthrough sharing model parameters instead of data. The traditional FL updates\nthe global model synchronously, i.e., the RSU needs to wait for all vehicles to\nupload their models for the global model updating. However, vehicles may\nusually drive out of the coverage of the RSU before they obtain their local\nmodels through training, which reduces the accuracy of the global model. It is\nnecessary to propose an asynchronous federated learning (AFL) to solve this\nproblem, where the RSU updates the global model once it receives a local model\nfrom a vehicle.

The\nsecurity of the LN hinges on the ability of the nodes to close a channel by\nsettling their balances, which requires confirming a transaction on the Bitcoin\nblockchain within a pre-agreed time period. This inherent timing restriction\nthat the LN must satisfy, make it susceptible to attacks that seek to increase\nthe congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain, thus preventing correct protocol\nexecution. We study the susceptibility of the LN to \\emph{mass exit} attacks,\nin the presence of a small coalition of adversarial nodes. This is a scenario\nwhere an adversary forces a large set of honest protocol participants to\ninteract with the blockchain. We focus on two types of attacks: (i) The first\nis a \\emph{zombie} attack, where a set of $k$ nodes become unresponsive with\nthe goal to lock the funds of many channels for a period of time longer than\nwhat the LN protocol dictates. (ii) The second is a \\emph{mass double-spend}\nattack, where a set of $k$ nodes attempt to steal funds by submitting many\nclosing transactions that settle channels using expired protocol states; this\ncauses many honest nodes to have to quickly respond by submitting invalidating\ntransactions. We show via simulations that, under historically-plausible\ncongestion conditions, with mild statistical assumptions on channel balances,\nboth of the attacks can be performed by a very small coalition. To perform our\nsimulations, we formulate the problem of finding a worst-case coalition of $k$\nadversarial nodes as a graph cut problem.

To improve the\nrobustness of SGG models on different predicate categories, recent research has\nfocused on unbiased SGG and adopted mean Recall@K (mR@K) as the main evaluation\nmetric. However, we discovered two overlooked issues about this de facto\nstandard metric mR@K, which makes current unbiased SGG evaluation vulnerable\nand unfair: 1) mR@K neglects the correlations among predicates and\nunintentionally breaks category independence when ranking all the triplet\npredictions together regardless of the predicate categories, leading to the\nperformance of some predicates being underestimated. 2) mR@K neglects the\ncompositional diversity of different predicates and assigns excessively high\nweights to some oversimple category samples with limited composable relation\ntriplet types. It totally conflicts with the goal of SGG task which encourages\nmodels to detect more types of visual relationship triplets. In addition, we\ninvestigate the under-explored correlation between objects and predicates,\nwhich can serve as a simple but strong baseline for unbiased SGG. In this\npaper, we refine mR@K and propose two complementary evaluation metrics for\nunbiased SGG: Independent Mean Recall (IMR) and weighted IMR (wIMR).

    "abstract": "Domain shifts, such as appearance changes, are a key challenge in real-world\napplications of activity recognition models, which range from assistive\nrobotics and smart homes to driver observation in intelligent vehicles. For\nexample, while simulations are an excellent way of economical data collection,\na Synthetic-to-Real domain shift leads to a > 60% drop in accuracy when\nrecognizing activities of Daily Living (ADLs). We tackle this challenge and\nintroduce an activity domain generation framework which creates novel ADL\nappearances (novel domains) from different existing activity modalities (source\ndomains) inferred from video training data. Our framework computes human poses,\nheatmaps of body joints, and optical flow maps and uses them alongside the\noriginal RGB videos to learn the essence of source domains in order to generate\ncompletely new ADL domains. The model is optimized by maximizing the distance\nbetween the existing source appearances and the generated novel appearances\nwhile ensuring that the semantics of an activity is preserved through an\nadditional classification loss. While source data multimodality is an important\nconcept in this design, our setup does not rely on multi-sensor setups, (i.e.,\nall source modalities are inferred from a single video only.) The newly created\nactivity domains are then integrated in the training of the ADL classification\nnetworks, resulting in models far less susceptible to changes in data\ndistributions. Extensive experiments on the Synthetic-to-Real benchmark\nSims4Action demonstrate the potential of the domain generation paradigm for\ncross-domain ADL recognition, setting new state-of-the-art results.

The dynamical systems\nof multivariate time series could be modelled with complex unknown partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) which play a prominent role in many disciplines\nof science and engineering. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time model\nfor arbitrary-step prediction to learn an unknown PDE system in multivariate\ntime series whose governing equations are parameterised by self-attention and\ngated recurrent neural networks. The proposed model,\n\\underline{E}xogenous-\\underline{g}uided \\underline{P}artial\n\\underline{D}ifferential \\underline{E}quation Network (EgPDE-Net), takes\naccount of the relationships among the exogenous variables and their effects on\nthe target series. Importantly, the model can be reduced into a regularised\nordinary differential equation (ODE) problem with special designed\nregularisation guidance, which makes the PDE problem tractable to obtain\nnumerical solutions and feasible to predict multiple future values of the\ntarget series at arbitrary time points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour proposed model could achieve competitive accuracy over strong baselines: on\naverage, it outperforms the best baseline by reducing $9.85\\%$ on RMSE and\n$13.98\\%$ on MAE for arbitrary-step prediction.",

We propose an efficient yet effective machine learning\napproach to synthesize gestures driven by prosodic features and text in the\nstyle of different speakers including those unseen during training. Our model\nperforms zero shot multimodal style transfer driven by multimodal data from the\nPATS database containing videos of various speakers. We view style as being\npervasive while speaking, it colors the communicative behaviors expressivity\nwhile speech content is carried by multimodal signals and text. This\ndisentanglement scheme of content and style allows us to directly infer the\nstyle embedding even of speaker whose data are not part of the training phase,\nwithout requiring any further training or fine tuning. The first goal of our\nmodel is to generate the gestures of a source speaker based on the content of\ntwo audio and text modalities. The second goal is to condition the source\nspeaker predicted gestures on the multimodal behavior style embedding of a\ntarget speaker. The third goal is to allow zero shot style transfer of speakers\nunseen during training without retraining the model. Our system consists of:\n(1) a speaker style encoder network that learns to generate a fixed dimensional\nspeaker embedding style from a target speaker multimodal data and (2) a\nsequence to sequence synthesis network that synthesizes gestures based on the\ncontent of the input modalities of a source speaker and conditioned on the\nspeaker style embedding. We evaluate that our model can synthesize gestures of\na source speaker and transfer the knowledge of target speaker style variability\nto the gesture generation task in a zero shot setup.

These methods predict object masks frame-by-frame\nwith the help of frequently updated memory of the previous mask. Different from\nthis per-frame inference, we investigate an alternative perspective by treating\nvideo object segmentation as clip-wise mask propagation. In this per-clip\ninference scheme, we update the memory with an interval and simultaneously\nprocess a set of consecutive frames (i.e. clip) between the memory updates. The\nscheme provides two potential benefits: accuracy gain by clip-level\noptimization and efficiency gain by parallel computation of multiple frames. To\nthis end, we propose a new method tailored for the per-clip inference.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a clip-wise operation to refine the features\nbased on intra-clip correlation. In addition, we employ a progressive matching\nmechanism for efficient information-passing within a clip.

Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocols offer stronger\nsecurity guarantees, and thus are widely used in blockchain systems. However,\ntheir security guarantees come at a dear cost to their performance and\nscalability. Several works have improved BFT protocols, and Trusted Execution\nEnvironment (TEE) has been shown to be an effective solution. However, existing\nsuch works typically assume that each participating node is equipped with TEE.\nFor blockchain systems wherein participants typically have different hardware\nconfigurations, i.e., some nodes feature TEE while others do not, existing\nTEE-based BFT protocols are not applicable.\nThis work studies the setting wherein not all participating nodes feature\nTEE, under which we propose a new fault model called mixed fault. We explore a\nnew approach to designing efficient distributed fault-tolerant protocols under\nthe mixed fault model. In general, mixed fault tolerance (MFT) protocols assume\na network of $n$ nodes, among which up to $f = \\frac{n-2}{3}$ can be subject to\nmixed faults. We identify two key principles for designing efficient MFT\nprotocols, namely, (i) prioritizing non-equivocating nodes in leading the\nprotocol, and (ii) advocating the use of public-key cryptographic primitives\nthat allow authenticated messages to be aggregated. We showcase these design\nprinciples by prescribing an MFT protocol, namely MRaft.\nWe implemented a prototype of MRaft using Intel SGX, integrated it into the\nCCF blockchain framework, conducted experiments, and showed that MFT protocols\ncan obtain the same security guarantees as their BFT counterparts while still\nproviding better performance (both transaction throughput and latency) and\nscalability.",

This task requires a system to\nspatially and temporally localize the most recent appearance of a given object\nquery, where query is registered by a single tight visual crop of the object in\na different scene.\nOur study is based on the three-stage baseline introduced in the Episodic\nMemory benchmark. The baseline solves the problem by detection and tracking:\ndetect the similar objects in all the frames, then run a tracker from the most\nconfident detection result. In the VQ2D challenge, we identified two\nlimitations of the current baseline. (1) The training configuration has\nredundant computation. Although the training set has millions of instances,\nmost of them are repetitive and the number of unique object is only around\n14.6k. The repeated gradient computation of the same object lead to an\ninefficient training; (2) The false positive rate is high on background frames.\nThis is due to the distribution gap between training and evaluation. During\ntraining, the model is only able to see the clean, stable, and labeled frames,\nbut the egocentric videos also have noisy, blurry, or unlabeled background\nframes. To this end, we developed a more efficient and effective solution.\nConcretely, we bring the training loop from ~15 days to less than 24 hours, and\nwe achieve 0.17% spatial-temporal AP, which is 31% higher than the baseline.\nOur solution got the first ranking on the public leaderboard.

    "abstract": "Understanding human emotions is a crucial ability for intelligent robots to\nprovide better human-robot interactions. The existing works are limited to\ntrimmed video-level emotion classification, failing to locate the temporal\nwindow corresponding to the emotion. In this paper, we introduce a new task,\nnamed Temporal Emotion Localization in videos~(TEL), which aims to detect human\nemotions and localize their corresponding temporal boundaries in untrimmed\nvideos with aligned subtitles. TEL presents three unique challenges compared to\ntemporal action localization: 1) The emotions have extremely varied temporal\ndynamics; 2) The emotion cues are embedded in both appearances and complex\nplots; 3) The fine-grained temporal annotations are complicated and\nlabor-intensive. To address the first two challenges, we propose a novel\ndilated context integrated network with a coarse-fine two-stream architecture.\nThe coarse stream captures varied temporal dynamics by modeling\nmulti-granularity temporal contexts. The fine stream achieves complex plots\nunderstanding by reasoning the dependency between the multi-granularity\ntemporal contexts from the coarse stream and adaptively integrates them into\nfine-grained video segment features. To address the third challenge, we\nintroduce a cross-modal consensus learning paradigm, which leverages the\ninherent semantic consensus between the aligned video and subtitle to achieve\nweakly-supervised learning. We contribute a new testing set with 3,000\nmanually-annotated temporal boundaries so that future research on the TEL\nproblem can be quantitatively evaluated. Extensive experiments show the\neffectiveness of our approach on temporal emotion localization.

In this work, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning\nmethod that automatically selects the most effective data augmentation policy\nfor a particular dataset.

The augmentation is learned in additional\ntraining before the classification training and makes use of bi-level\noptimization, to optimize the augmentation policy and maximize accuracy. We\nevaluate our approach on two domain-specific datasets, containing satellite\nimages and hand-drawn sketches, and obtain state-of-the-art results.

Similar to previous work, a\ndifferentiable renderer ensures perceptual fidelity between the 3D scene and\nthe 2D video. Our key novelty lies in the inclusion of a differentiable\napproach to solve a set of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) that allows\nus to approximately model laws of physics such as gravity, friction, and\nhand-object or object-object interactions. This not only enables us to\ndramatically improve the quality of estimated hand and object states, but also\nproduces physically admissible trajectories that can be directly translated to\na robot without the need for costly reinforcement learning. We evaluate our\napproach on a 3D reconstruction task that consists of 54 video demonstrations\nsourced from 9 actions such as pull something from right to left or put\nsomething in front of something. Our approach improves over previous\nstate-of-the-art by almost 30%, demonstrating superior quality on especially\nchallenging actions involving physical interactions of two objects such as put\nsomething onto something.

    "abstract": "Developers often need to decide which APIs to use for the functions being\nimplemented. With the ever-growing number of APIs and libraries, it becomes\nincreasingly difficult for developers to find appropriate APIs, indicating the\nnecessity of automatic API usage recommendation. Previous studies adopt\nstatistical models or collaborative filtering methods to mine the implicit API\nusage patterns for recommendation. However, they rely on the occurrence\nfrequencies of APIs for mining usage patterns, thus prone to fail for the\nlow-frequency APIs. Besides, prior studies generally regard the API call\ninteraction graph as homogeneous graph, ignoring the rich information (e.g.,\nedge types) in the structure graph. In this work, we propose a novel method\nnamed MEGA for improving the recommendation accuracy especially for the\nlow-frequency APIs. Specifically, besides call interaction graph, MEGA\nconsiders another two new heterogeneous graphs: global API co-occurrence graph\nenriched with the API frequency information and hierarchical structure graph\nenriched with the project component information. With the three multi-view\nheterogeneous graphs, MEGA can capture the API usage patterns more accurately.\nExperiments on three Java benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEGA\nsignificantly outperforms the baseline models by at least 19% with respect to\nthe Success Rate@1 metric.

Our\nobjective is to provide a baseline of settings for similar studies in the\nfuture. The models we use are the N-Gram model, which is a classic approach in\nthe field of natural language processing (NLP), and two deep learning (DL)\nmodels long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN).\nFor datasets we used four datasets Profilence, BlueGene/L (BGL), Hadoop\nDistributed File System (HDFS) and Hadoop. Other settings are the size of the\nsliding window which determines how many surrounding events we are using to\npredict a given event, mask position (the position within the window we are\npredicting), the usage of only unique sequences, and the portion of data that\nis used for training. The results show clear indications of settings that can\nbe generalized across datasets. The performance of the DL models does not\ndeteriorate as the window size increases while the N-Gram model shows worse\nperformance with large window sizes on the BGL and Profilence datasets. Despite\nthe popularity of Next Event Prediction, the results show that in this context\nit is better not to predict events at the edges of the subsequence, i.e., first\nor last event, with the best result coming from predicting the fourth event\nwhen the window size is five. Regarding the amount of data used for training,\nthe results show differences across datasets and models. For example, the\nN-Gram model appears to be more sensitive toward the lack of data than the DL\nmodels.

Domain\nGeneralization (DG) aims to safely transfer a model to unseen target domains by\nonly relying on a set of source domains. Although various DG approaches have\nbeen proposed, a recent study named DomainBed, reveals that most of them do not\nbeat the simple Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). To this end, we propose a\ngeneral framework that is orthogonal to existing DG algorithms and could\nimprove their performance consistently. Unlike previous DG works that stake on\na static source model to be hopefully a universal one, our proposed AdaODM\nadaptively modifies the source model at test time for different target domains.\nSpecifically, we create multiple domain-specific classifiers upon a shared\ndomain-generic feature extractor. The feature extractor and classifiers are\ntrained in an adversarial way, where the feature extractor embeds the input\nsamples into a domain-invariant space, and the multiple classifiers capture the\ndistinct decision boundaries that each of them relates to a specific source\ndomain. During testing, distribution differences between target and source\ndomains could be effectively measured by leveraging prediction disagreement\namong source classifiers. By fine-tuning source models to minimize the\ndisagreement at test time, target domain features are well aligned to the\ninvariant feature space. We verify AdaODM on two popular DG methods, namely ERM\nand CORAL, and four DG benchmarks, namely VLCS, PACS, OfficeHome, and\nTerraIncognita.

    "abstract": "Fine-grained visual classification can be addressed by deep representation\nlearning under supervision of manually pre-defined targets (e.g., one-hot or\nthe Hadamard codes). Such target coding schemes are less flexible to model\ninter-class correlation and are sensitive to sparse and imbalanced data\ndistribution as well. In light of this, this paper introduces a novel target\ncoding scheme -- dynamic target relation graphs (DTRG), which, as an auxiliary\nfeature regularization, is a self-generated structural output to be mapped from\ninput images. Specifically, online computation of class-level feature centers\nis designed to generate cross-category distance in the representation space,\nwhich can thus be depicted by a dynamic graph in a non-parametric manner.\nExplicitly minimizing intra-class feature variations anchored on those\nclass-level centers can encourage learning of discriminative features.\nMoreover, owing to exploiting inter-class dependency, the proposed target\ngraphs can alleviate data sparsity and imbalanceness in representation\nlearning. Inspired by recent success of the mixup style data augmentation, this\npaper introduces randomness into soft construction of dynamic target relation\ngraphs to further explore relation diversity of target classes. Experimental\nresults can demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a number of diverse\nbenchmarks of multiple visual classification tasks, especially achieving the\nstate-of-the-art performance on popular fine-grained object benchmarks and\nsuperior robustness against sparse and imbalanced data.

    "abstract": "In monocular depth estimation, disturbances in the image context, like moving\nobjects or reflecting materials, can easily lead to erroneous predictions. For\nthat reason, uncertainty estimates for each pixel are necessary, in particular\nfor safety-critical applications such as automated driving. We propose a post\nhoc uncertainty estimation approach for an already trained and thus fixed depth\nestimation model, represented by a deep neural network. The uncertainty is\nestimated with the gradients which are extracted with an auxiliary loss\nfunction. To avoid relying on ground-truth information for the loss definition,\nwe present an auxiliary loss function based on the correspondence of the depth\nprediction for an image and its horizontally flipped counterpart. Our approach\nachieves state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation results on the KITTI and NYU\nDepth V2 benchmarks without the need to retrain the neural network.

Next, the prescribed performance control\nmethod is employed for designing a robust low-complexity funnel-based\ncontroller for uncertain nonlinear Euler-Lagrangian systems such that the\noutputs always remain within the planned constraint consistent funnels.\nFinally, the results are verified with a simulation example of a mobile robot\ntracking a moving object while staying in a box-constrained safe space.",

    "abstract": "Human safety has always been the main priority when working near an\nindustrial robot. With the rise of Human-Robot Collaborative environments,\nphysical barriers to avoiding collisions have been disappearing, increasing the\nrisk of accidents and the need for solutions that ensure a safe Human-Robot\nCollaboration. This paper proposes a safety system that implements Speed and\nSeparation Monitoring (SSM) type of operation. For this, safety zones are\ndefined in the robot's workspace following current standards for industrial\ncollaborative robots. A deep learning-based computer vision system detects,\ntracks, and estimates the 3D position of operators close to the robot. The\nrobot control system receives the operator's 3D position and generates 3D\nrepresentations of them in a simulation environment. Depending on the zone\nwhere the closest operator was detected, the robot stops or changes its\noperating speed. Three different operation modes in which the human and robot\ninteract are presented. Results show that the vision-based system can correctly\ndetect and classify in which safety zone an operator is located and that the\ndifferent proposed operation modes ensure that the robot's reaction and stop\ntime are within the required time limits to guarantee safety.",

A major reason is that\ncertain combinations of domains and labels are not observed during training but\nappear in the test environment. Although various invariance-based algorithms\ncan be applied, we find that the performance gain is often marginal. To\nformally analyze this issue, we provide a unique algebraic formulation of the\ncombination shift problem based on the concepts of homomorphism, equivariance,\nand a refined definition of disentanglement. The algebraic requirements\nnaturally derive a simple yet effective method, referred to as equivariant\ndisentangled transformation (EDT), which augments the data based on the\nalgebraic structures of labels and makes the transformation satisfy the\nequivariance and disentanglement requirements. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat invariance may be insufficient, and it is important to exploit the\nequivariance structure in the combination shift problem.",

In the case of Unmanned Aircraft\nSystems (UAS), this evolution allows drastically decreasing aircraft weight and\noperational cost, but these benefits are also realized in highly automated\nmanned aircraft and ground Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems. The downside of\nthese advances is overwhelmingly more complex software and hardware, making it\nharder to identify potential failure paths. Although there are mandatory\ncertification processes based on broadly accepted standards, such as ARP4754\nand its family, ESARR 4 and others, these standards do not allow proof or\ndisproof of safety of disruptive technology changes, such as GBAS Precision\nApproaches, Autonomous UAS, aircraft self-separation and others. In order to\nleverage the introduction of such concepts, it is necessary to develop solid\nknowledge on the foundations of safety in complex systems and use this\nknowledge to elaborate sound demonstrations of either safety or unsafety of new\nsystem designs. These demonstrations at early design stages will help reducing\ncosts both on development of new technology as well as reducing the risk of\nsuch technology causing accidents when in use.\nThis paper presents some safety analysis methods which are not in the\nindustry standards but which we identify as having benefits for analyzing\nsafety of advanced technological concepts in aviation.",

These algorithms can be generally divided into two categories,\ni.e. two-stage detector like Faster R-CNN and one-stage detector like YOLO.\nBecause of the better balance between accuracy and speed, one-stage detectors\nhave been widely used in many applications. In this paper, we propose a\nreal-time face detector based on the one-stage detector YOLOv5, named\nYOLO-FaceV2. We design a Receptive Field Enhancement module called RFE to\nenhance receptive field of small face, and use NWD Loss to make up for the\nsensitivity of IoU to the location deviation of tiny objects. For face\nocclusion, we present an attention module named SEAM and introduce Repulsion\nLoss to solve it. Moreover, we use a weight function Slide to solve the\nimbalance between easy and hard samples and use the information of the\neffective receptive field to design the anchor. The experimental results on\nWiderFace dataset show that our face detector outperforms YOLO and its variants\ncan be find in all easy, medium and hard subsets.

Further, the number of heterogeneous tools for deployment of machine\nlearning solutions can easily overwhelm practitioners. Research is needed to\nalign the process from modeling to deploying ML workflows.\nWe analyze requirements for standard based conceptual modeling for machine\nlearning workflows and their serverless deployment. Confronting the\nshortcomings with respect to consistent and coherent modeling of ML workflows\nin a technology independent and interoperable manner, we extend BPMN's\nMeta-Object Facility (MOF) metamodel and the corresponding notation and\nintroduce BPMN4sML (BPMN for serverless machine learning).

Computing equilibria in auction games is computationally hard in\ngeneral and no exact solution theory is known. We introduce algorithms\ncomputing distributional strategies on a discretized version of the game via\nonline convex optimization. One advantage of distributional strategies is that\nwe do not have to make any assumptions on the shape of the bid function.\nBesides, the expected utility of agents is linear in the strategies. It follows\nthat if our regularized optimization algorithms converge to a pure strategy,\nthen they converge to an approximate equilibrium of the discretized game with\nhigh precision. Importantly, we show that the equilibrium of the discretized\ngame approximates an equilibrium in the continuous game. In a wide variety of\nauction games, we provide empirical evidence that the method approximates the\nanalytical (pure) Bayes Nash equilibrium closely. This speed and precision is\nremarkable, because in many finite games learning dynamics do not converge or\nare even chaotic. In standard models where agents are symmetric, we find\nequilibrium in seconds.

    "abstract": "We introduce SmartControllerJS, a new JavaScript library for fast,\ncost-effective designing of web applications controlled via everyday\nsmartphones. At its core, SmartControllerJS establishes a connection between\ntwo webpages, one page running on a desktop browser and the other on the user's\nsmartphone. The smartphone webpage loads a controller interface allowing users\nto control a web application running on their computer's browser. The\nSmartControllerJS framework enables fast iteration loops when designing\ninteractive user experiments because it has minimal friction and allows for\nscaling, while having no running costs. We first describe how this library is\nbuilt, how it can be used, and provide interactive examples. We then present\ntwo games designed for public screens along with results from user studies\nevaluating acceptability and ease of use. Finally, we implement a custom\ncontroller based on user feedback and introduce connection monitoring tools. We\nbelieve SmartControllerJS can accelerate the design of interactive experiments\nfor researchers in Human-Computer Interaction, and be a useful tool for\neducational projects. To experience the various demos, we recommend reading\nthis work on a desktop computer with your smartphone in hand. The library and\nthe demos are available at https://github.com/SmartControllerJS",

    "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting (CF) occurs when a neural network loses the\ninformation previously learned while training on a set of samples from a\ndifferent distribution, i.e., a new task. Existing approaches have achieved\nremarkable results in mitigating CF, especially in a scenario called task\nincremental learning. However, this scenario is not realistic, and limited work\nhas been done to achieve good results on more realistic scenarios. In this\npaper, we propose a novel regularization method called Centroids Matching,\nthat, inspired by meta-learning approaches, fights CF by operating in the\nfeature space produced by the neural network, achieving good results while\nrequiring a small memory footprint. Specifically, the approach classifies the\nsamples directly using the feature vectors produced by the neural network, by\nmatching those vectors with the centroids representing the classes from the\ncurrent task, or all the tasks up to that point. Centroids Matching is faster\nthan competing baselines, and it can be exploited to efficiently mitigate CF,\nby preserving the distances between the embedding space produced by the model\nwhen past tasks were over, and the one currently produced, leading to a method\nthat achieves high accuracy on all the tasks, without using an external memory\nwhen operating on easy scenarios, or using a small one for more realistic ones.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Centroids Matching achieves accuracy\ngains on multiple datasets and scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Recently, graph neural networks have shown the superiority of modeling the\ncomplex topological structures in heterogeneous network-based recommender\nsystems. Due to the diverse interactions among nodes and abundant semantics\nemerging from diverse types of nodes and edges, there is a bursting research\ninterest in learning expressive node representations in multiplex heterogeneous\nnetworks. One of the most important tasks in recommender systems is to predict\nthe potential connection between two nodes under a specific edge type (i.e.,\nrelationship). Although existing studies utilize explicit metapaths to\naggregate neighbors, practically they only consider intra-relationship\nmetapaths and thus fail to leverage the potential uplift by inter-relationship\ninformation. Moreover, it is not always straightforward to exploit\ninter-relationship metapaths comprehensively under diverse relationships,\nespecially with the increasing number of node and edge types. In addition,\ncontributions of different relationships between two nodes are difficult to\nmeasure. To address the challenges, we propose HybridGNN, an end-to-end GNN\nmodel with hybrid aggregation flows and hierarchical attentions to fully\nutilize the heterogeneity in the multiplex scenarios. Specifically, HybridGNN\napplies a randomized inter-relationship exploration module to exploit the\nmultiplexity property among different relationships. Then, our model leverages\nhybrid aggregation flows under intra-relationship metapaths and randomized\nexploration to learn the rich semantics. To explore the importance of different\naggregation flow and take advantage of the multiplexity property, we bring\nforward a novel hierarchical attention module which leverages both\nmetapath-level attention and relationship-level attention. Extensive\nexperimental results suggest that HybridGNN achieves the best performance\ncompared to several state-of-the-art baselines.",

Recent studies on audio-visual scene classification separately\nfine-tune the largescale audio and image pre-trained models on the target\ndataset, then either fuse the intermediate representations of the audio model\nand the visual model, or fuse the coarse-grained decision of both models at the\nclip level. Such methods ignore the detailed audio events and visual objects in\naudio-visual scenes (AVS), while humans often identify different scenes through\naudio events and visual objects within and the congruence between them. To\nexploit the fine-grained information of audio events and visual objects in AVS,\nand coordinate the implicit relationship between audio events and visual\nobjects, this paper proposes a multibranch model equipped with contrastive\nevent-object alignment (CEOA) and semantic-based fusion (SF) for AVSC. CEOA\naims to align the learned embeddings of audio events and visual objects by\ncomparing the difference between audio-visual event-object pairs. Then, visual\nobjects associated with certain audio events and vice versa are accentuated by\ncross-attention and undergo SF for semantic-level fusion. Experiments show\nthat: 1) the proposed AVSC model equipped with CEOA and SF outperforms the\nresults of audio-only and visual-only models, i.e., the audio-visual results\nare better than the results from a single modality. 2) CEOA aligns the\nembeddings of audio events and related visual objects on a fine-grained level,\nand the SF effectively integrates both; 3) Compared with other large-scale\nintegrated systems, the proposed model shows competitive performance, even\nwithout using additional datasets and data augmentation tricks.",

    "abstract": "Cache template attacks demonstrated automated leakage of user input in shared\nlibraries. However, for large binaries, the runtime is prohibitively high.\nOther automated approaches focused on cryptographic implementations and media\nsoftware but are not directly applicable to user input. Hence, discovering and\neliminating all user input side-channel leakage on a cache-line granularity\nwithin huge code bases are impractical.\nIn this paper, we present a new generic cache template attack technique,\nLBTA, layered binary templating attacks. LBTA uses multiple coarser-grained\nside channel layers as an extension to cache-line granularity templating to\nspeed up the runtime of cache templating attacks. We describe LBTA with a\nvariable number of layers with concrete side channels of different granularity,\nranging from 64 B to 2MB in practice and in theory beyond. In particular the\nsoftware-level page cache side channel in combination with the hardware-level\nL3 cache side channel, already reduces the templating runtime by three orders\nof magnitude. We apply LBTAs to different software projects and thereby\ndiscover data deduplication and dead-stripping during compilation and linking\nas novel security issues. We show that these mechanisms introduce large spatial\ndistances in binaries for data accessed during a keystroke, enabling reliable\nleakage of keystrokes. Using LBTA on Chromium-based applications, we can build\na full unprivileged cache-based keylogger. Our findings show that all user\ninput to Chromium-based apps is affected and we demonstrate this on a selection\nof popular apps including Signal, Threema, Discord, and password manager apps\nlike passky. As this is not a flaw of individual apps but the framework, we\nconclude that all apps that use the framework will also be affected, i.e.,\nhundreds of apps.",

SDN is one of the promising solutions to\nchange the architecture of internet networks. Attacks become more common due to\nthe centralized nature of SDN architecture. It is vital to provide security for\nthe SDN. In this study, we propose a Network Intrusion Detection System-Deep\nLearning module (NIDS-DL) approach in the context of SDN. Our suggested method\ncombines Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) with many types of deep\nlearning algorithms. Our approach employs 12 features extracted from 41\nfeatures in the NSL-KDD dataset using a feature selection method. We employed\nclassifiers (CNN, DNN, RNN, LSTM, and GRU). When we compare classifier scores,\nour technique produced accuracy results of (98.63%, 98.53%, 98.13%, 98.04%, and\n97.78%) respectively. The novelty of our new approach (NIDS-DL) uses 5 deep\nlearning classifiers and made pre-processing dataset to harvests the best\nresults.

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series anomaly detection has been extensively studied under\nthe semi-supervised setting, where a training dataset with all normal instances\nis required. However, preparing such a dataset is very laborious since each\nsingle data instance should be fully guaranteed to be normal. It is, therefore,\ndesired to explore multivariate time series anomaly detection methods based on\nthe dataset without any label knowledge. In this paper, we propose MTGFlow, an\nunsupervised anomaly detection approach for Multivariate Time series anomaly\ndetection via dynamic Graph and entity-aware normalizing Flow, leaning only on\na widely accepted hypothesis that abnormal instances exhibit sparse densities\nthan the normal. However, the complex interdependencies among entities and the\ndiverse inherent characteristics of each entity pose significant challenges on\nthe density estimation, let alone to detect anomalies based on the estimated\npossibility distribution. To tackle these problems, we propose to learn the\nmutual and dynamic relations among entities via a graph structure learning\nmodel, which helps to model accurate distribution of multivariate time series.\nMoreover, taking account of distinct characteristics of the individual\nentities, an entity-aware normalizing flow is developed to describe each entity\ninto a parameterized normal distribution, thereby producing fine-grained\ndensity estimation. Incorporating these two strategies, MTGFlowachieves\nsuperior anomaly detection performance. Experiments on the real-world datasets\nare conducted, demonstrating that MTGFlow outperforms the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) by 5.0% and 1.6% AUROC for SWaT and WADI datasets respectively. Also,\nthrough the anomaly scores contributed by individual entities, MTGFlow can\nprovide explanation information for the detection results.",

    "abstract": "Consciousness and intelligence are properties commonly understood as\ndependent by folk psychology and society in general. The term artificial\nintelligence and the kind of problems that it managed to solve in the recent\nyears has been shown as an argument to establish that machines experience some\nsort of consciousness. Following the analogy of Russell, if a machine is able\nto do what a conscious human being does, the likelihood that the machine is\nconscious increases. However, the social implications of this analogy are\ncatastrophic. Concretely, if rights are given to entities that can solve the\nkind of problems that a neurotypical person can, does the machine have\npotentially more rights that a person that has a disability? For example, the\nautistic syndrome disorder spectrum can make a person unable to solve the kind\nof problems that a machine solves. We believe that the obvious answer is no, as\nproblem solving does not imply consciousness. Consequently, we will argue in\nthis paper how phenomenal consciousness and, at least, computational\nintelligence are independent and why machines do not possess phenomenal\nconsciousness, although they can potentially develop a higher computational\nintelligence that human beings. In order to do so, we try to formulate an\nobjective measure of computational intelligence and study how it presents in\nhuman beings, animals and machines. Analogously, we study phenomenal\nconsciousness as a dichotomous variable and how it is distributed in humans,\nanimals and machines. As phenomenal consciousness and computational\nintelligence are independent, this fact has critical implications for society\nthat we also analyze in this work.",

Unfortunately, in practice, this process often exploits\nspurious correlations caused by subgroup imbalance within the training data,\nresulting in high average performance but highly variable performance across\nsubgroups.

We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof RealPatch on three benchmark datasets, CelebA, Waterbirds and a subset of\niWildCam, showing improvements in worst-case subgroup performance and in\nsubgroup performance gap in binary classification. Furthermore, we conduct\nexperiments with the imSitu dataset with 211 classes, a setting where\ngenerative model-based patching such as CAMEL is impractical.

However, the optimization\nof high-level intermediate representation (IR) is found to be error-prone.\nTesting the implementation of high-level optimization is challenging. First,\ngenerating high-level IRs that conform to the integrity constraints required by\nhigh-level optimization is non-trivial. Non-conforming IRs are readily rejected\nby DL compilers before entering the optimization stage, and therefore these IRs\nare not useful to detect bugs at the stage. Second, it is challenging to expose\nhigh-level optimization bugs that does not result in crashes.\nTo address the challenges, we propose HIRFuzz, a fuzzing technique that aims\nto reveal bugs occurring at the optimization of high-level IR in DL compilers.\nHIRFuzz generates computational graphs, which are then converted to their\nunderlying high-level IRs for optimization. To reveal high-level optimization\nbugs, the computational graphs are so generated to explore possible\ncombinations of data types, tensor shapes and operators while conforming to the\nIR's integrity constraints. In addition, novel test oracles are designed to\ndetect bugs occurring at high-level optimization. HIRFuzz has successfully\ndetected 24 new high-level optimization bugs that occur at TVM, with 19 bugs\nconfirmed and 14 fixed. Furthermore, our experiment results show that HIRFuzz\noutperforms the state-of-the-art DL compiler fuzzers that can cover high-level\noptimization stage.

The best generic decoding algorithms are\nall improvements of an old algorithm due to Prange: they are known under the\nname of information set decoders (ISD). A while ago, a generic decoding\nalgorithm which does not belong to this family was proposed: statistical\ndecoding. It is a randomized algorithm that requires the computation of a large\nset of parity-checks of moderate weight, and uses some kind of majority voting\non these equations to recover the error. This algorithm was long forgotten\nbecause even the best variants of it performed poorly when compared to the\nsimplest ISD algorithm.\nWe revisit this old algorithm by using parity-check equations in a more\ngeneral way. Here the parity-checks are used to get LPN samples with a secret\nwhich is part of the error and the LPN noise is related to the weight of the\nparity-checks we produce. The corresponding LPN problem is then solved by\nstandard Fourier techniques. By properly choosing the method of producing these\nlow weight equations and the size of the LPN problem, we are able to outperform\nin this way significantly information set decodings at code rates smaller than\n$0.3$.

Our main\ncontribution is the first algorithm for computing stationary\n$\\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria in adversarial team Markov games with\ncomputational complexity that is polynomial in all the natural parameters of\nthe game, as well as $1/\\epsilon$. The proposed algorithm is particularly\nnatural and practical, and it is based on performing independent policy\ngradient steps for each player in the team, in tandem with best responses from\nthe side of the adversary; in turn, the policy for the adversary is then\nobtained by solving a carefully constructed linear program. Our analysis\nleverages non-standard techniques to establish the KKT optimality conditions\nfor a nonlinear program with nonconvex constraints, thereby leading to a\nnatural interpretation of the induced Lagrange multipliers. Along the way, we\nsignificantly extend an important characterization of optimal policies in\nadversarial (normal-form) team games due to Von Stengel and Koller (GEB `97).",

An automated building damage assessment provides\ncritical information for decision making and resource allocation for rapid\nemergency response. Satellite imagery provides real-time, high-coverage\ninformation and offers opportunities to inform large-scale post-disaster\nbuilding damage assessment. In addition, deep-learning methods have shown to be\npromising in classifying building damage. In this work, a novel\ntransformer-based network is proposed for assessing building damage. This\nnetwork leverages hierarchical spatial features of multiple resolutions and\ncaptures temporal difference in the feature domain after applying a transformer\nencoder on the spatial features. The proposed network achieves\nstate-of-the-art-performance when tested on a large-scale disaster damage\ndataset (xBD) for building localization and damage classification, as well as\non LEVIR-CD dataset for change detection tasks. In addition, we introduce a new\nhigh-resolution satellite imagery dataset, Ida-BD (related to the 2021\nHurricane Ida in Louisiana in 2021, for domain adaptation to further evaluate\nthe capability of the model to be applied to newly damaged areas with scarce\ndata. The domain adaptation results indicate that the proposed model can be\nadapted to a new event with only limited fine-tuning. Hence, the proposed model\nadvances the current state of the art through better performance and domain\nadaptation. Also, Ida-BD provides a higher-resolution annotated dataset for\nfuture studies in this field.",

    "abstract": "The design of online policies for stochastic matching and revenue management\nsettings is usually bound by the Bayesian prior that the demand process is\nformed by a fixed-length sequence of queries with unknown types, each drawn\nindependently. This assumption of serial independence implies that the demand\nof each type, i.e., the number of queries of a given type, has low variance and\nis approximately Poisson-distributed. Thus, matching policies are often based\non \"fluid\" LPs that only use the expectations of these distributions.\nThis paper explores alternative stochastic models for online matching that\nallow for nonparametric, higher variance demand distributions. We propose two\nnew models, INDEP and CORREL, that relax the serial independence assumption in\ndifferent ways by combining a nonparametric distribution for the demand with\nstandard assumptions on the arrival patterns -- adversarial or random-order. In\nour INDEP model, the demand for each type follows an arbitrary distribution,\nwhile being mutually independent across different types. In our CORREL model,\nthe total demand follows an arbitrary distribution, and conditional on the\nsequence length, the type of each query is drawn independently. In both\nsettings, we show that the fluid LP relaxation based on only expected demands\ncan be an arbitrarily bad benchmark for algorithm design. We develop tighter LP\nrelaxations for the INDEP and CORREL models that leverage the exact\ndistribution of the demand, leading to matching algorithms that achieve\nconstant-factor performance guarantees under adversarial and random-order\narrivals. More broadly, our paper provides a data-driven framework for\nexpressing demand uncertainty (i.e., variance and correlations) in online\nstochastic matching models.",

By only training a query-based image\ninstance segmentation model, MinVIS outperforms the previous best result on the\nchallenging Occluded VIS dataset by over 10% AP. Since MinVIS treats frames in\ntraining videos as independent images, we can drastically sub-sample the\nannotated frames in training videos without any modifications. With only 1% of\nlabeled frames, MinVIS outperforms or is comparable to fully-supervised\nstate-of-the-art approaches on YouTube-VIS 2019/2021. Our key observation is\nthat queries trained to be discriminative between intra-frame object instances\nare temporally consistent and can be used to track instances without any\nmanually designed heuristics. MinVIS thus has the following inference pipeline:\nwe first apply the trained query-based image instance segmentation to video\nframes independently. The segmented instances are then tracked by bipartite\nmatching of the corresponding queries. This inference is done in an online\nfashion and does not need to process the whole video at once. MinVIS thus has\nthe practical advantages of reducing both the labeling costs and the memory\nrequirements, while not sacrificing the VIS performance.

    "abstract": "Wireless energy transfer (WET) is a promising solution to enable massive\nmachine-type communications (mMTC) with low-complexity and low-powered wireless\ndevices. Given the energy restrictions of the devices, instant channel state\ninformation at the transmitter (CSIT) is not expected to be available in\npractical WET-enabled mMTC. However, because it is common that the terminals\nappear spatially clustered, some degree of spatial correlation between their\nchannels to the base station (BS) is expected to occur. The paper considers a\nmassive antenna array at the BS for WET that only has access to i) the first\nand second order statistics of the Rician channel component of the\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel and also to ii) the line-of-sight\nMIMO component. The optimal precoding scheme that maximizes the total energy\navailable to the single-antenna devices is derived considering a continuous\nalphabet for the precoders, permitting any modulated or deterministic waveform.\nThis may lead to some devices in the clusters being assigned a low fraction of\nthe total available power in the cluster, creating a rather uneven situation\namong them. Consequently, a fairness criterion is introduced, imposing a\nminimum amount of power allocated to the terminals. A piece-wise linear\nharvesting circuit is considered at the terminals, with both saturation and a\nminimum sensitivity, and a constrained version of the precoder is also proposed\nby solving a non-linear programming problem. A paramount benefit of the\nconstrained precoder is the encompassment of fairness in the power allocation\nto the different clusters. Moreover, given the polynomial complexity increase\nof the proposed unconstrained precoder, and the observed linear gain of the\nsystem's available sum-power with an increasing number of antennas at the ULA,\nthe use of massive antenna arrays is desirable.",

While previous attempts on optimizing learned image codecs focused more\non the neural model and entropy coding, we present an alternative method to\nimproving the runtime performance of various learned image compression models.\nWe introduce multi-threaded pipelining and an optimized memory model to enable\nGPU and CPU workloads asynchronous execution, fully taking advantage of\ncomputational resources. Our architecture alone already produces excellent\nperformance without any change to the neural model itself.

A holistic study of the growing chemistry\nliterature is, therefore, required that focuses on understanding the recent\ntrends and extrapolating them into possible future trajectories. To this end,\nseveral network theory-based studies have been reported that use a directed\ngraph representation of chemical reactions. Here, we perform a study based on\nrepresenting chemical reactions as hypergraphs where the hyperedges represent\nchemical reactions and nodes represent the participating molecules. We use a\nstandard reactions dataset to construct a hypernetwork and report its\nstatistics such as degree distributions, average path length, assortativity or\ndegree correlations, PageRank centrality, and graph-based clusters (or\ncommunities). We also compute each statistic for an equivalent directed graph\nrepresentation of reactions to draw parallels and highlight differences between\nthe two. To demonstrate the AI applicability of hypergraph reaction\nrepresentation, we generate dense hypergraph embeddings and use them in the\nreaction classification problem. We conclude that the hypernetwork\nrepresentation is flexible, preserves reaction context, and uncovers hidden\ninsights that are otherwise not apparent in a traditional directed graph\nrepresentation of chemical reactions.",

This is done by introducing a new object called a sheaf that\nis put on top of a high dimensional expander. Sheaves are vastly studied in\ntopology. Here, we introduce sheaves on simplicial complexes. Moreover, we\ndefine a notion of an expanding sheaf that has not been studied before.\nWe present a framework to get good infinite families of $2$-query LTCs from\nexpanding sheaves on high dimensional expanders, utilizing towers of coverings\nof these high dimensional expanders. Starting with a high dimensional expander\nand an expanding sheaf, our framework produces an infinite family of codes\nadmitting a $2$-query tester. We show that if the initial sheaved high\ndimensional expander satisfies some conditions, which can be checked in\nconstant time, then these codes form a family of good $2$-query LTCs.\nWe give candidates for sheaved high dimensional expanders which can be fed\ninto our framework, in the form of an iterative process which conjecturally\nproduces such candidates given a high dimensional expander and a special\nauxiliary sheaf.

However, supervised\nmethods rely on a large number of labeled radiology images, which is a\ntime-consuming and complex procedure requiring expert clinician input. Due to\nthe relative scarcity of COVID-19 patient data and the costly labeling process,\nself-supervised learning methods have gained momentum and has been proposed\nachieving comparable results to fully supervised learning approaches. In this\nwork, we study the effectiveness of self-supervised learning in the context of\ndiagnosing COVID-19 disease from CXR images.

    "abstract": "New powerful tools for tackling life science problems have been created by\nrecent advances in machine learning. The purpose of the paper is to discuss the\npotential advantages of gene recommendation performed by artificial\nintelligence (AI). Indeed, gene recommendation engines try to solve this\nproblem: if the user is interested in a set of genes, which other genes are\nlikely to be related to the starting set and should be investigated? This task\nwas solved with a custom deep learning recommendation engine, DeepProphet2\n(DP2), which is freely available to researchers worldwide via\nwww.generecommender.com. Hereafter, insights behind the algorithm and its\npractical applications are illustrated.\nThe gene recommendation problem can be addressed by mapping the genes to a\nmetric space where a distance can be defined to represent the real semantic\ndistance between them. To achieve this objective a transformer-based model has\nbeen trained on a well-curated freely available paper corpus, PubMed. The paper\ndescribes multiple optimization procedures that were employed to obtain the\nbest bias-variance trade-off, focusing on embedding size and network depth. In\nthis context, the model's ability to discover sets of genes implicated in\ndiseases and pathways was assessed through cross-validation. A simple\nassumption guided the procedure: the network had no direct knowledge of\npathways and diseases but learned genes' similarities and the interactions\namong them. Moreover, to further investigate the space where the neural network\nrepresents genes, the dimensionality of the embedding was reduced, and the\nresults were projected onto a human-comprehensible space. In conclusion, a set\nof use cases illustrates the algorithm's potential applications in a real word\nsetting.",

In this paper, electromagnetic models of real hands and cellphone\nantennas are developed, and their efficacy is verified through measurements for\nthe first time in the literature. Referential cellphone antenna arrays at $28$\nand $39$~GHz are designed. Their radiation properties are evaluated through\nnear-field scanning of the two prototypes, first in free space for calibration\nof the antenna measurement system and for building simplified models of the\ncellphone arrays. Next, radiation measurements are set up with real hands so\nthat they are compared with electromagnetic simulations of the interaction\nbetween hands and simplified models of the arrays. The comparison showed a\nclose agreement in terms of spherical coverage, indicating the efficacy of the\nhand and antenna array models along with the measurement approach. The\nrepeatability of the measurements is $0.5$~dB difference in terms of cumulative\ndistributions of the spherical coverage at the median level.",

    "abstract": "The coordinated alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) for coupled\ntransmission-distribution grids has become crucial to handle problems related\nto high penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs). However, obtaining all\nsystem details and solving ACOPF centrally is not feasible because of privacy\nconcerns. Intermittent RESs and uncontrollable loads can swiftly change the\noperating condition of the power grid. Existing decentralized optimization\nmethods can seldom track the optimal solutions of time-varying ACOPFs. Here, we\npropose an online decentralized optimization method to track the time-varying\nACOPF of coupled transmission-distribution grids. First, the time-varying ACOPF\nproblem is converted to a dynamic system based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions\nfrom the control perspective. Second, a prediction term denoted by the partial\nderivative with respect to time is developed to improve the tracking accuracy\nof the dynamic system. Third, a decentralized implementation for solving the\ndynamic system is designed based on only a few information exchanges with\nrespect to boundary variables. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be used to\ndirectly address nonlinear power flow equations without relying on convex\nrelaxations or linearization techniques.

Viewing a convolution filter as a motif within an image, the\npersistence diagram of the resulting convolution describes the way the motif is\ndistributed throughout that image. This pipeline, which we call convolutional\npersistence, extends the capacity of topology to observe patterns in image\ndata. Indeed, we prove that (generically speaking) for any two images one can\nfind some filter for which they produce different persistence diagrams, so that\nthe collection of all possible convolutional persistence diagrams for a given\nimage is an injective invariant. This is proven by showing convolutional\npersistence to be a special case of another topological invariant, the\nPersistent Homology Transform. Other advantages of convolutional persistence\nare improved stability and robustness to noise, greater flexibility for\ndata-dependent vectorizations, and reduced computational complexity for\nconvolutions with large stride vectors.

However, existing CNN\nbased pulmonary nodule detection methods lack the ability to capture long-range\ndependencies, which is vital for global information extraction. In computer\nvision tasks, non-local operations have been widely utilized, but the\ncomputational cost could be very high for 3D computed tomography (CT) images.\nTo address this issue, we propose a long short slice-aware network (LSSANet)\nfor the detection of pulmonary nodules. In particular, we develop a new\nnon-local mechanism termed long short slice grouping (LSSG), which splits the\ncompact non-local embeddings into a short-distance slice grouped one and a\nlong-distance slice grouped counterpart. This not only reduces the\ncomputational burden, but also keeps long-range dependencies among any elements\nacross slices and in the whole feature map. The proposed LSSG is easy-to-use\nand can be plugged into many pulmonary nodule detection networks. To verify the\nperformance of LSSANet, we compare with several recently proposed and\ncompetitive detection approaches based on 2D/3D CNN. Promising evaluation\nresults on the large-scale PN9 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod. Code is at https://github.com/Ruixxxx/LSSANet.",

In this work,\nwe show that the pretty-good measurement naturally plays a role as the union\nbound as well. A judicious application of it considerably simplifies the\nderivation of one-shot achievability for classical-quantum (c-q) channel coding\nvia an elegant three-line proof.\nThe proposed analysis enjoys the following favorable features: (i) The\nestablished one-shot bound admits a closed-form expression as in the celebrated\nHolevo-Helstrom Theorem. Namely, the average error probability of sending $M$\nmessages through a c-q channel is upper bounded by the error of distinguishing\nthe joint state between channel input and output against $(M-1)$-many products\nof its marginals. (ii) Our bound directly yields asymptotic results in the\nlarge deviation, small deviation, and moderate deviation regimes in a unified\nmanner. (iii) The coefficients incurred in applying the Hayashi-Nagaoka\noperator inequality are no longer needed. Hence, the derived one-shot bound\nsharpens existing results that rely on the Hayashi-Nagaoka operator inequality.\nIn particular, we obtain the tightest achievable $\\epsilon$-one-shot capacity\nfor c-q channel heretofore, and it improves the third-order coding rate in the\nasymptotic scenario.

(v) The proposed method applies to deriving one-shot bounds for data\ncompression with quantum side information, entanglement-assisted classical\ncommunication over quantum channels, and various quantum network\ninformation-processing protocols.",

This is motivated by the promising performance gains, especially as\nthey assist each other, and by the better utilization of the wireless and\nhardware resources. Realizing these gains in practice, however, is subject to\nseveral challenges where leveraging machine learning can provide a potential\nsolution. This article focuses on ten key machine learning roles for joint\nsensing and communication, sensing-aided communication, and communication-aided\nsensing systems, explains why and how machine learning can be utilized, and\nhighlights important directions for future research. The article also presents\nreal-world results for some of these machine learning roles based on the\nlarge-scale real-world dataset DeepSense 6G, which could be adopted in\ninvestigating a wide range of integrated sensing and communication problems.",

    "title": "Conv-NILM-Net, a causal and multi-appliance model for energy source  separation",
    "abstract": "Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) seeks to save energy by estimating\nindividual appliance power usage from a single aggregate measurement. Deep\nneural networks have become increasingly popular in attempting to solve NILM\nproblems. However most used models are used for Load Identification rather than\nonline Source Separation. Among source separation models, most use a\nsingle-task learning approach in which a neural network is trained exclusively\nfor each appliance. This strategy is computationally expensive and ignores the\nfact that multiple appliances can be active simultaneously and dependencies\nbetween them. The rest of models are not causal, which is important for\nreal-time application. Inspired by Convtas-Net, a model for speech separation,\nwe propose Conv-NILM-net, a fully convolutional framework for end-to-end NILM.\nConv-NILM-net is a causal model for multi appliance source separation. Our\nmodel is tested on two real datasets REDD and UK-DALE and clearly outperforms\nthe state of the art while keeping a significantly smaller size than the\ncompeting models.",

We\ninvestigate machine learning based tuning of gate arrays using the CMA-ES\nalgorithm for the case study of Majorana wires with strong disorder. We find\nthat the algorithm is able to efficiently improve the topological signatures,\nlearn intrinsic disorder profiles, and completely eliminate disorder effects.\nFor example, with only 20 gates, it is possible to fully recover Majorana zero\nmodes destroyed by disorder by optimizing gate voltages.",

    "abstract": "In human speech, the attitude of a speaker cannot be fully expressed only by\nthe textual content. It has to come along with the intonation. Declarative\nquestions are commonly used in daily Cantonese conversations, and they are\nusually uttered with rising intonation. Vanilla neural text-to-speech (TTS)\nsystems are not capable of synthesizing rising intonation for these sentences\ndue to the loss of semantic information. Though it has become more common to\ncomplement the systems with extra language models, their performance in\nmodeling rising intonation is not well studied. In this paper, we propose to\ncomplement the Cantonese TTS model with a BERT-based statement/question\nclassifier. We design different training strategies and compare their\nperformance. We conduct our experiments on a Cantonese corpus named CanTTS.\nEmpirical results show that the separate training approach obtains the best\ngeneralization performance and feasibility.",

    "abstract": "Nearly 30% of the people in the rural areas of Bangladesh are below the\npoverty level. Moreover, due to the unavailability of modernized\nhealthcare-related technology, nursing and diagnosis facilities are limited for\nrural people. Therefore, rural people are deprived of proper healthcare. In\nthis perspective, modern technology can be facilitated to mitigate their health\nproblems. ECG sensing tools are interfaced with the human chest, and requisite\ncardiovascular data is collected through an IoT device. These data are stored\nin the cloud incorporates with the MQTT and HTTP servers. An innovative\nIoT-based method for ECG monitoring systems on cardiovascular or heart patients\nhas been suggested in this study. The ECG signal parameters P, Q, R, S, T are\ncollected, pre-processed, and predicted to monitor the cardiovascular\nconditions for further health management. The machine learning algorithm is\nused to determine the significance of ECG signal parameters and error rate. The\nlogistic regression model fitted the better agreements between the train and\ntest data. The prediction has been performed to determine the variation of\nPQRST quality and its suitability in the ECG Monitoring System. Considering the\nvalues of quality parameters, satisfactory results are obtained. The proposed\nIoT-based ECG system reduces the health care cost and complexity of\ncardiovascular diseases in the future.",
