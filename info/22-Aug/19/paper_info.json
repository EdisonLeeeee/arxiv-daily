    "title": "Performance Evaluation of Selective Fixed-filter Active Noise Control  based on Different Convolutional Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Due to its rapid response time and a high degree of robustness, the selective\nfixed-filter active noise control (SFANC) method appears to be a viable\ncandidate for widespread use in a variety of practical active noise control\n(ANC) systems. In comparison to conventional fixed-filter ANC methods, SFANC\ncan select the pre-trained control filters for different types of noise. Deep\nlearning technologies, thus, can be used in SFANC methods to enable a more\nflexible selection of the most appropriate control filters for attenuating\nvarious noises. Furthermore, with the assistance of a deep neural network, the\nselecting strategy can be learned automatically from noise data rather than\nthrough trial and error, which significantly simplifies and improves the\npracticability of ANC design. Therefore, this paper investigates the\nperformance of SFANC based on different one-dimensional and two-dimensional\nconvolutional neural networks. Additionally, we conducted comparative analyses\nof several network training strategies and discovered that fine-tuning could\nimprove selection performance.",

    "abstract": "In supervised machine learning, use of correct labels is extremely important\nto ensure high accuracy. Unfortunately, most datasets contain corrupted labels.\nMachine learning models trained on such datasets do not generalize well. Thus,\ndetecting their label errors can significantly increase their efficacy. We\npropose a novel framework, called CTRL (Clustering TRaining Losses for label\nerror detection), to detect label errors in multi-class datasets. It detects\nlabel errors in two steps based on the observation that models learn clean and\nnoisy labels in different ways. First, we train a neural network using the\nnoisy training dataset and obtain the loss curve for each sample. Then, we\napply clustering algorithms to the training losses to group samples into two\ncategories: cleanly-labeled and noisily-labeled. After label error detection,\nwe remove samples with noisy labels and retrain the model. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate state-of-the-art error detection accuracy on both image\n(CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) and tabular datasets under simulated noise. We also\nuse a theoretical analysis to provide insights into why CTRL performs so well.",

    "abstract": "People with blindness and low vision (pBLV) experience significant challenges\nwhen locating final destinations or targeting specific objects in unfamiliar\nenvironments. Furthermore, besides initially locating and orienting oneself to\na target object, approaching the final target from one's present position is\noften frustrating and challenging, especially when one drifts away from the\ninitial planned path to avoid obstacles. In this paper, we develop a novel\nwearable navigation solution to provide real-time guidance for a user to\napproach a target object of interest efficiently and effectively in unfamiliar\nenvironments. Our system contains two key visual computing functions: initial\ntarget object localization in 3D and continuous estimation of the user's\ntrajectory, both based on the 2D video captured by a low-cost monocular camera\nmounted on in front of the chest of the user. These functions enable the system\nto suggest an initial navigation path, continuously update the path as the user\nmoves, and offer timely recommendation about the correction of the user's path.\nOur experiments demonstrate that our system is able to operate with an error of\nless than 0.5 meter both outdoor and indoor. The system is entirely\nvision-based and does not need other sensors for navigation, and the\ncomputation can be run with the Jetson processor in the wearable system to\nfacilitate real-time navigation assistance.",

Motivated\nby this fact, in this work we generalize graph convolutional neural networks\n(GCN) to the complex domain, deriving the theory that allows to incorporate a\ncomplex-valued graph shift operators (GSO) in the definition of graph filters\n(GF) and process complex-valued graph signals (GS).

Also, with appropriate algorithmic designs, one could\nachieve the desirable linear speedup for convergence effect in FL.

Real life data in machine learning is usually\nvery noisy and almost never clean, which can be attributed to various factors\ndepending on the domain, e.g. outliers, random noise and adversarial noise.\nTherefore, the models we develop for various tasks should be robust to such\nkinds of noisy data, which led to the thriving field of robust machine\nlearning. We consider this important issue in the setting of automatic speech\nrecognition. With the increasing popularity of pre-trained models, it's an\nimportant question to analyze and understand the robustness of such models to\nnoise. In this work, we perform a robustness analysis of the pre-trained neural\nmodels wav2vec2, HuBERT and DistilHuBERT on the LibriSpeech and TIMIT datasets.\nWe use different kinds of noising mechanisms and measure the model performances\nas quantified by the inference time and the standard Word Error Rate metric. We\nalso do an in-depth layer-wise analysis of the wav2vec2 model when injecting\nnoise in between layers, enabling us to predict at a high level what each layer\nlearns. Finally for this model, we visualize the propagation of errors across\nthe layers and compare how it behaves on clean versus noisy data. Our\nexperiments conform the predictions of Pasad et al. [2021] and also raise\ninteresting directions for future work.",

    "abstract": "This work addresses visual cross-view metric localization for outdoor\nrobotics. Given a ground-level color image and a satellite patch that contains\nthe local surroundings, the task is to identify the location of the ground\ncamera within the satellite patch. Related work addressed this task for\nrange-sensors (LiDAR, Radar), but for vision, only as a secondary regression\nstep after an initial cross-view image retrieval step. Since the local\nsatellite patch could also be retrieved through any rough localization prior\n(e.g. from GPS/GNSS, temporal filtering), we drop the image retrieval objective\nand focus on the metric localization only. We devise a novel network\narchitecture with denser satellite descriptors, similarity matching at the\nbottleneck (rather than at the output as in image retrieval), and a dense\nspatial distribution as output to capture multi-modal localization ambiguities.\nWe compare against a state-of-the-art regression baseline that uses global\nimage descriptors. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on the\nrecently proposed VIGOR and the Oxford RobotCar datasets validate our design.\nThe produced probabilities are correlated with localization accuracy, and can\neven be used to roughly estimate the ground camera's heading when its\norientation is unknown. Overall, our method reduces the median metric\nlocalization error by 51%, 37%, and 28% compared to the state-of-the-art when\ngeneralizing respectively in the same area, across areas, and across time.",

    "abstract": "Social engineering (SE) is a form of deception that aims to trick people into\ngiving access to data, information, networks and even money. For decades SE has\nbeen a key method for attackers to gain access to an organization, virtually\nskipping all lines of defense. Attackers also regularly use SE to scam innocent\npeople by making threatening phone calls which impersonate an authority or by\nsending infected emails which look like they have been sent from a loved one.\nSE attacks will likely remain a top attack vector for criminals because humans\nare the weakest link in cyber security.\nUnfortunately, the threat will only get worse now that a new technology\ncalled deepfakes as arrived. A deepfake is believable media (e.g., videos)\ncreated by an AI. Although the technology has mostly been used to swap the\nfaces of celebrities, it can also be used to `puppet' different personas.\nRecently, researchers have shown how this technology can be deployed in\nreal-time to clone someone's voice in a phone call or reenact a face in a video\ncall. Given that any novice user can download this technology to use it, it is\nno surprise that criminals have already begun to monetize it to perpetrate\ntheir SE attacks.\nIn this paper, we propose a lightweight application which can protect\norganizations and individuals from deepfake SE attacks. Through a challenge and\nresponse approach, we leverage the technical and theoretical limitations of\ndeepfake technologies to expose the attacker. Existing defence solutions are\ntoo heavy as an end-point solution and can be evaded by a dynamic attacker. In\ncontrast, our approach is lightweight and breaks the reactive arms race,\nputting the attacker at a disadvantage.",

Comprehensible models for sequential\ndecision tasks are a particular challenge as they require understanding not\nonly individual predictions but a series of predictions that interact with\nenvironmental dynamics. We present a framework for learning comprehensible\nmodels of sequential decision tasks in which agent strategies are characterized\nusing temporal logic formulas. Given a set of agent traces, we first cluster\nthe traces using a novel embedding method that captures frequent action\npatterns. We then search for logical formulas that explain the agent strategies\nin the different clusters. We evaluate our framework on combat scenarios in\nStarCraft II (SC2), using traces from a handcrafted expert policy and a trained\nreinforcement learning agent. We implemented a feature extractor for SC2\nenvironments that extracts traces as sequences of high-level features\ndescribing both the state of the environment and the agent's local behavior\nfrom agent replays. We further designed a visualization tool depicting the\nmovement of units in the environment that helps understand how different task\nconditions lead to distinct agent behavior patterns in each trace cluster.\nExperimental results show that our framework is capable of separating agent\ntraces into distinct groups of behaviors for which our approach to strategy\ninference produces consistent, meaningful, and easily understood strategy\ndescriptions.",

To address this question, we\npropose a new paradigm called Restructurable Activation Networks (RANs) that\nmanipulate the amount of non-linearity in models to improve their\nhardware-awareness and efficiency. First, we propose RAN-explicit (RAN-e) -- a\nnew hardware-aware search space and a semi-automatic search algorithm -- to\nreplace inefficient blocks with hardware-aware blocks. Next, we propose a\ntraining-free model scaling method called RAN-implicit (RAN-i) where we\ntheoretically prove the link between network topology and its expressivity in\nterms of number of non-linear units. We demonstrate that our networks achieve\nstate-of-the-art results on ImageNet at different scales and for several types\nof hardware. For example, compared to EfficientNet-Lite-B0, RAN-e achieves a\nsimilar accuracy while improving Frames-Per-Second (FPS) by 1.5x on Arm\nmicro-NPUs. On the other hand, RAN-i demonstrates up to 2x reduction in #MACs\nover ConvNexts with a similar or better accuracy. We also show that RAN-i\nachieves nearly 40% higher FPS than ConvNext on Arm-based datacenter CPUs.\nFinally, RAN-i based object detection networks achieve a similar or higher mAP\nand up to 33% higher FPS on datacenter CPUs compared to ConvNext based models.",

Specifically, given a 3D shape, we render it\nfrom multiple views, and set up a dense correspondence learning task within the\ncontrastive learning framework. As a result, the learned 2D representations are\nview-invariant and geometrically consistent, leading to better generalization\nwhen trained on a limited number of labeled shapes compared to alternatives\nthat utilize self-supervision in 2D or 3D alone. Experiments on textured\n(RenderPeople) and untextured (PartNet) 3D datasets show that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in fine-grained part segmentation.\nThe improvements over baselines are greater when only a sparse set of views is\navailable for training or when shapes are textured, indicating that MvDeCor\nbenefits from both 2D processing and 3D geometric reasoning.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing graph neural network models have achieved significant progress\nin graph representation learning. However, in this paper, we uncover an\never-overlooked phenomenon: the pre-trained graph representation learning model\ntested with full graphs underperforms the model tested with well-pruned graphs.\nThis observation reveals that there exist confounders in graphs, which may\ninterfere with the model learning semantic information, and current graph\nrepresentation learning methods have not eliminated their influence. To tackle\nthis issue, we propose Robust Causal Graph Representation Learning (RCGRL) to\nlearn robust graph representations against confounding effects. RCGRL\nintroduces an active approach to generate instrumental variables under\nunconditional moment restrictions, which empowers the graph representation\nlearning model to eliminate confounders, thereby capturing discriminative\ninformation that is causally related to downstream predictions. We offer\ntheorems and proofs to guarantee the theoretical effectiveness of the proposed\napproach. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset\nand multiple benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods, RCGRL achieves better prediction performance and\ngeneralization ability.",

    "title": "Restoration of User Videos Shared on Social Media",
    "abstract": "User videos shared on social media platforms usually suffer from degradations\ncaused by unknown proprietary processing procedures, which means that their\nvisual quality is poorer than that of the originals. This paper presents a new\ngeneral video restoration framework for the restoration of user videos shared\non social media platforms. In contrast to most deep learning-based video\nrestoration methods that perform end-to-end mapping, where feature extraction\nis mostly treated as a black box, in the sense that what role a feature plays\nis often unknown, our new method, termed Video restOration through adapTive\ndEgradation Sensing (VOTES), introduces the concept of a degradation feature\nmap (DFM) to explicitly guide the video restoration process. Specifically, for\neach video frame, we first adaptively estimate its DFM to extract features\nrepresenting the difficulty of restoring its different regions. We then feed\nthe DFM to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to compute hierarchical\ndegradation features to modulate an end-to-end video restoration backbone\nnetwork, such that more attention is paid explicitly to potentially more\ndifficult to restore areas, which in turn leads to enhanced restoration\nperformance. We will explain the design rationale of the VOTES framework and\npresent extensive experimental results to show that the new VOTES method\noutperforms various state-of-the-art techniques both quantitatively and\nqualitatively. In addition, we contribute a large scale real-world database of\nuser videos shared on different social media platforms.

    "abstract": "It's common for current methods in skeleton-based action recognition to\nmainly consider capturing long-term temporal dependencies as skeleton sequences\nare typically long (>128 frames), which forms a challenging problem for\nprevious approaches. In such conditions, short-term dependencies are few\nformally considered, which are critical for classifying similar actions. Most\ncurrent approaches are consisted of interleaving spatial-only modules and\ntemporal-only modules, where direct information flow among joints in adjacent\nframes are hindered, thus inferior to capture short-term motion and distinguish\nsimilar action pairs. To handle this limitation, we propose a general\nframework, coined as STGAT, to model cross-spacetime information flow. It\nequips the spatial-only modules with spatial-temporal modeling for regional\nperception. While STGAT is theoretically effective for spatial-temporal\nmodeling, we propose three simple modules to reduce local spatial-temporal\nfeature redundancy and further release the potential of STGAT, which (1) narrow\nthe scope of self-attention mechanism, (2) dynamically weight joints along\ntemporal dimension, and (3) separate subtle motion from static features,\nrespectively. As a robust feature extractor, STGAT generalizes better upon\nclassifying similar actions than previous methods, witnessed by both\nqualitative and quantitative results.

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance for medical image segmentation, yet need plenty of manual\nannotations for training. Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods are promising\nto reduce the requirement of annotations, but their performance is still\nlimited when the dataset size and the number of annotated images are small.\nLeveraging existing annotated datasets with similar anatomical structures to\nassist training has a potential for improving the model's performance. However,\nit is further challenged by the cross-anatomy domain shift due to the different\nappearance and even imaging modalities from the target structure. To solve this\nproblem, we propose Contrastive Semi-supervised learning for Cross Anatomy\nDomain Adaptation (CS-CADA) that adapts a model to segment similar structures\nin a target domain, which requires only limited annotations in the target\ndomain by leveraging a set of existing annotated images of similar structures\nin a source domain. We use Domain-Specific Batch Normalization (DSBN) to\nindividually normalize feature maps for the two anatomical domains, and propose\na cross-domain contrastive learning strategy to encourage extracting domain\ninvariant features. They are integrated into a Self-Ensembling Mean-Teacher\n(SE-MT) framework to exploit unlabeled target domain images with a prediction\nconsistency constraint. Extensive experiments show that our CS-CADA is able to\nsolve the challenging cross-anatomy domain shift problem, achieving accurate\nsegmentation of coronary arteries in X-ray images with the help of retinal\nvessel images and cardiac MR images with the help of fundus images,\nrespectively, given only a small number of annotations in the target domain.",

To handle the\nproblem of backhaul bottleneck in cellular network and satisfy people's\nrequirements about latency, the network architecture like information-centric\nnetwork (ICN) intends to proactively keep limited popular content at the edge\nof network based on predicted results. Meanwhile, the interactions between the\ncontent (e.g., deep neural network models, Wikipedia-alike knowledge base) and\nusers could be regarded as a dynamic bipartite graph. In this paper, to\nmaximize the cache hit rate, we leverage an effective dynamic graph neural\nnetwork (DGNN) to jointly learn the structural and temporal patterns embedded\nin the bipartite graph. Furthermore, in order to have deeper insights into the\ndynamics within the evolving graph, we propose an age of information (AoI)\nbased attention mechanism to extract valuable historical information while\navoiding the problem of message staleness. Combining this aforementioned\nprediction model, we also develop a cache selection algorithm to make caching\ndecisions in accordance with the prediction results.

    "abstract": "Text-based person retrieval aims to find the query person based on a textual\ndescription. The key is to learn a common latent space mapping between\nvisual-textual modalities. To achieve this goal, existing works employ\nsegmentation to obtain explicitly cross-modal alignments or utilize attention\nto explore salient alignments. These methods have two shortcomings: 1) Labeling\ncross-modal alignments are time-consuming. 2) Attention methods can explore\nsalient cross-modal alignments but may ignore some subtle and valuable pairs.\nTo relieve these issues, we introduce an Implicit Visual-Textual (IVT)\nframework for text-based person retrieval. Different from previous models, IVT\nutilizes a single network to learn representation for both modalities, which\ncontributes to the visual-textual interaction. To explore the fine-grained\nalignment, we further propose two implicit semantic alignment paradigms:\nmulti-level alignment (MLA) and bidirectional mask modeling (BMM). The MLA\nmodule explores finer matching at sentence, phrase, and word levels, while the\nBMM module aims to mine \\textbf{more} semantic alignments between visual and\ntextual modalities. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the\nproposed IVT on public datasets, i.e., CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReID, and ICFG-PEDES.\nEven without explicit body part alignment, our approach still achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.

In the recent years, it was\nestablished that Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) have an equivalent\nrepresentation in Boolean logic and can be formally analyzed using logical\nreasoning tools such as SAT solvers. However, to date, only BNNs can be\ntransformed into a SAT formula. In this work, we introduce Truth Table Deep\nConvolutional Neural Networks (TTnets), a new family of SAT-encodable models\nfeaturing for the first time real-valued weights. Furthermore, it admits, by\nconstruction, some valuable conversion features including post-tuning and\ntractability in the robustness verification setting. The latter property leads\nto a more compact SAT symbolic encoding than BNNs. This enables the use of\ngeneral SAT solvers, making property verification easier. We demonstrate the\nvalue of TTnets regarding the formal robustness property: TTnets outperform the\nverified accuracy of all BNNs with a comparable computation time. More\ngenerally, they represent a relevant trade-off between all known complete\nverification methods: TTnets achieve high verified accuracy with fast\nverification time, being complete with no timeouts. We are exploring here a\nproof of concept of TTnets for a very important application (complete\nverification of robustness) and we believe this novel real-valued network\nconstitutes a practical response to the rising need for functional formal\nverification. We postulate that TTnets can apply to various CNN-based\narchitectures and be extended to other properties such as fairness, fault\nattack and exact rule extraction.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in 4D implicit representation focuses on globally controlling\nthe shape and motion with low dimensional latent vectors, which is prone to\nmissing surface details and accumulating tracking error. While many deep local\nrepresentations have shown promising results for 3D shape modeling, their 4D\ncounterpart does not exist yet. In this paper, we fill this blank by proposing\na novel Local 4D implicit Representation for Dynamic clothed human, named LoRD,\nwhich has the merits of both 4D human modeling and local representation, and\nenables high-fidelity reconstruction with detailed surface deformations, such\nas clothing wrinkles. Particularly, our key insight is to encourage the network\nto learn the latent codes of local part-level representation, capable of\nexplaining the local geometry and temporal deformations. To make the inference\nat test-time, we first estimate the inner body skeleton motion to track local\nparts at each time step, and then optimize the latent codes for each part via\nauto-decoding based on different types of observed data. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed method has strong capability for representing 4D\nhuman, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on practical applications,\nincluding 4D reconstruction from sparse points, non-rigid depth fusion, both\nqualitatively and quantitatively.",

Second, NTPP models based on stochastic differential\nequations, despite their theoretical appeal and leading performance on\nliterature benchmarks, do not scale easily to large industry-scale data.

Existing supervised methods often fail to generalize well on\nunseen domains, while the unsupervised methods, mostly lack multi-granularity\ninformation and are prone to suffer from confirmation bias. In this paper, we\naim at finding better feature representations on the unseen target domain from\ntwo aspects, 1) performing unsupervised domain adaptation on the labeled source\ndomain and 2) mining potential similarities on the unlabeled target domain.\nBesides, a collaborative pseudo re-labeling strategy is proposed to alleviate\nthe influence of confirmation bias. Firstly, a generative adversarial network\nis utilized to transfer images from the source domain to the target domain.\nMoreover, person identity preserving and identity mapping losses are introduced\nto improve the quality of generated images. Secondly, we propose a novel\ncollaborative multiple feature clustering framework (CMFC) to learn the\ninternal data structure of target domain, including global feature and partial\nfeature branches. The global feature branch (GB) employs unsupervised\nclustering on the global feature of person images while the Partial feature\nbranch (PB) mines similarities within different body regions.

In\nthis paper, we propose a simple but effective Multilingual learning framework\nfor Zero-shot Dialogue Generation (dubbed as MulZDG) that can effectively\ntransfer knowledge from an English corpus with large-scale training samples to\na non-English corpus with zero samples. Besides, MulZDG can be viewed as a\nmultilingual data augmentation method to improve the performance of the\nresource-rich language. First, we construct multilingual code-switching\ndialogue datasets via translation utterances randomly selected from monolingual\nEnglish datasets. Then we employ MulZDG to train a unified multilingual\ndialogue model based on the code-switching datasets. The MulZDG can conduct\nimplicit semantic alignment between different languages.

As an example of\na parabolic problem, we consider the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) with a\npoint (Gaussian) source initial condition. In the $d$-dimensional ADE,\nperturbations in the initial condition decay with time $t$ as $t^{-d/2}$, which\ncan cause a large approximation error in the PINN solution. Localized large\ngradients in the ADE solution make the (common in PINN) Latin hypercube\nsampling of the equation's residual highly inefficient. Finally, the PINN\nsolution of parabolic equations is sensitive to the choice of weights in the\nloss function. We propose a normalized form of ADE where the initial\nperturbation of the solution does not decrease in amplitude and demonstrate\nthat this normalization significantly reduces the PINN approximation error. We\npropose criteria for weights in the loss function that produce a more accurate\nPINN solution than those obtained with the weights selected via other methods.\nFinally, we proposed an adaptive sampling scheme that significantly reduces the\nPINN solution error for the same number of the sampling (residual) points.

    "abstract": "There is currently no established method for evaluating human response timing\nacross a range of naturalistic traffic conflict types. Traditional notions\nderived from controlled experiments, such as perception-response time, fail to\naccount for the situation-dependency of human responses and offer no clear way\nto define the stimulus in many common traffic conflict scenarios. As a result,\nthey are not well suited for application in naturalistic settings. Our main\ncontribution is the development of a novel framework for measuring and modeling\nresponse times in naturalistic traffic conflicts applicable to automated\ndriving systems as well as other traffic safety domains. The framework suggests\nthat response timing must be understood relative to the subject's current\n(prior) belief and is always embedded in, and dependent on, the dynamically\nevolving situation. The response process is modeled as a belief update process\ndriven by perceived violations to this prior belief, that is, by surprising\nstimuli. The framework resolves two key limitations with traditional notions of\nresponse time when applied in naturalistic scenarios: (1) The strong\nsituation-dependence of response timing and (2) how to unambiguously define the\nstimulus. Resolving these issues is a challenge that must be addressed by any\nresponse timing model intended to be applied in naturalistic traffic conflicts.\nWe show how the framework can be implemented by means of a relatively simple\nheuristic model fit to naturalistic human response data from real crashes and\nnear crashes from the SHRP2 dataset and discuss how it is, in principle,\ngeneralizable to any traffic conflict scenario. We also discuss how the\nresponse timing framework can be implemented computationally based on evidence\naccumulation enhanced by machine learning-based generative models and the\ninformation-theoretic concept of surprise.",

However, these models sample a\nlarge number of negative entities and negative relations during the model\ntraining, which are essential but result in grossly imbalanced data\ndistributions and in turn cause suboptimal model performance. In order to\naddress the above issues, we propose a two-phase paradigm for the span-based\njoint entity and relation extraction, which involves classifying the entities\nand relations in the first phase, and predicting the types of these entities\nand relations in the second phase. The two-phase paradigm enables our model to\nsignificantly reduce the data distribution gap, including the gap between\nnegative entities and other entities, as well as the gap between negative\nrelations and other relations. In addition, we make the first attempt at\ncombining entity type and entity distance as global features, which has proven\neffective, especially for the relation extraction. Experimental results on\nseveral datasets demonstrate that the spanbased joint extraction model\naugmented with the two-phase paradigm and the global features consistently\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art span-based models for the joint\nextraction task, establishing a new standard benchmark.

    "abstract": "Secure multi-party computation-based machine learning, referred to as MPL,\nhas become an important technology to utilize data from multiple parties with\nprivacy preservation. While MPL provides rigorous security guarantees for the\ncomputation process, the models trained by MPL are still vulnerable to attacks\nthat solely depend on access to the models. Differential privacy could help to\ndefend against such attacks. However, the accuracy loss brought by differential\nprivacy and the huge communication overhead of secure multi-party computation\nprotocols make it highly challenging to balance the 3-way trade-off between\nprivacy, efficiency, and accuracy.\nIn this paper, we are motivated to resolve the above issue by proposing a\nsolution, referred to as PEA (Private, Efficient, Accurate), which consists of\na secure DPSGD protocol and two optimization methods. First, we propose a\nsecure DPSGD protocol to enforce DPSGD in secret sharing-based MPL frameworks.\nSecond, to reduce the accuracy loss led by differential privacy noise and the\nhuge communication overhead of MPL, we propose two optimization methods for the\ntraining process of MPL: (1) the data-independent feature extraction method,\nwhich aims to simplify the trained model structure; (2) the local data-based\nglobal model initialization method, which aims to speed up the convergence of\nthe model training. We implement PEA in two open-source MPL frameworks:\nTF-Encrypted and Queqiao. The experimental results on various datasets\ndemonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of PEA. E.g. when ${\\epsilon}$ =\n2, we can train a differentially private classification model with an accuracy\nof 88% for CIFAR-10 within 7 minutes under the LAN setting. This result\nsignificantly outperforms the one from CryptGPU, one SOTA MPL framework: it\ncosts more than 16 hours to train a non-private deep neural network model on\nCIFAR-10 with the same accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) are a recent family of\ngenerative models that achieve state-of-the-art results. In order to obtain\nclass-conditional generation, it was suggested to guide the diffusion process\nby gradients from a time-dependent classifier. While the idea is theoretically\nsound, deep learning-based classifiers are infamously susceptible to\ngradient-based adversarial attacks. Therefore, while traditional classifiers\nmay achieve good accuracy scores, their gradients are possibly unreliable and\nmight hinder the improvement of the generation results. Recent work discovered\nthat adversarially robust classifiers exhibit gradients that are aligned with\nhuman perception, and these could better guide a generative process towards\nsemantically meaningful images. We utilize this observation by defining and\ntraining a time-dependent adversarially robust classifier and use it as\nguidance for a generative diffusion model. In experiments on the highly\nchallenging and diverse ImageNet dataset, our scheme introduces significantly\nmore intelligible intermediate gradients, better alignment with theoretical\nfindings, as well as improved generation results under several evaluation\nmetrics. Furthermore, we conduct an opinion survey whose findings indicate that\nhuman raters prefer our method's results.",

    "abstract": "The state-of-the-art (SoTA) surface normal estimators (SNEs) generally\ntranslate depth images into surface normal maps in an end-to-end fashion.\nAlthough such SNEs have greatly minimized the trade-off between efficiency and\naccuracy, their performance on spatial discontinuities, e.g., edges and ridges,\nis still unsatisfactory. To address this issue, this paper first introduces a\nnovel multi-directional dynamic programming strategy to adaptively determine\ninliers (co-planar 3D points) by minimizing a (path) smoothness energy. The\ndepth gradients can then be refined iteratively using a novel recursive\npolynomial interpolation algorithm, which helps yield more reasonable surface\nnormals. Our introduced spatial discontinuity-aware (SDA) depth gradient\nrefinement strategy is compatible with any depth-to-normal SNEs. Our proposed\nSDA-SNE achieves much greater performance than all other SoTA approaches,\nespecially near/on spatial discontinuities. We further evaluate the performance\nof SDA-SNE with respect to different iterations, and the results suggest that\nit converges fast after only a few iterations. This ensures its high efficiency\nin various robotics and computer vision applications requiring real-time\nperformance. Additional experiments on the datasets with different extents of\nrandom noise further validate our SDA-SNE's robustness and environmental\nadaptability.

    "abstract": "Cake cutting is a classic model for studying fair division of a\nheterogeneous, divisible resource among agents with individual preferences.\nAddressing cake division under a typical requirement that each agent must\nreceive a connected piece of the cake, we develop approximation algorithms for\nfinding envy-free (fair) cake divisions. In particular, this work improves the\nstate-of-the-art additive approximation bound for this fundamental problem. Our\nresults hold for general cake division instances in which the agents'\nvaluations satisfy basic assumptions and are normalized (to have value $1$ for\nthe cake). Furthermore, the developed algorithms execute in polynomial time\nunder the standard Robertson-Webb query model.\nPrior work has shown that one can efficiently compute a cake division (with\nconnected pieces) in which the additive envy of any agent is at most $1/3$. An\nefficient algorithm is also known for finding connected cake divisions that are\n(almost) $1/2$-multiplicatively envy-free. Improving the additive approximation\nguarantee and maintaining the multiplicative one, we develop a polynomial-time\nalgorithm that computes a connected cake division that is both\n$\\left(\\frac{1}{4} +o(1) \\right)$-additively envy-free and $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} -\no(1) \\right)$-multiplicatively envy-free. Our algorithm is based on the ideas\nof interval growing and envy-cycle-elimination.\nIn addition, we study cake division instances in which the number of distinct\nvaluations across the agents is parametrically bounded. We show that such cake\ndivision instances admit a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for\nconnected envy-free cake division.",

    "abstract": "Modern privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation\n(GDPR), address privacy in software systems in a technologically agnostic way\nby mentioning general \"technical measures\" for data privacy compliance rather\nthan dictating how these should be implemented. An understanding of the concept\nof technical measures and how exactly these can be handled in practice,\nhowever, is not trivial due to its interdisciplinary nature and the necessary\ntechnical-legal interactions. We aim to investigate how the concept of\ntechnical measures for data privacy compliance is understood in practice as\nwell as the technical-legal interaction intrinsic to the process of\nimplementing those technical measures. We follow a research design that is 1)\nexploratory in nature, 2) qualitative, and 3) interview-based, with 16 selected\nprivacy professionals in the technical and legal domains. Our results suggest\nthat there is no clear mutual understanding and commonly accepted approach to\nhandling technical measures. Both technical and legal roles are involved in the\nimplementation of such measures. While they still often operate in separate\nspheres, a predominant opinion amongst the interviewees is to promote more\ninterdisciplinary collaboration. Our empirical findings confirm the need for\nbetter interaction between legal and engineering teams when implementing\ntechnical measures for data privacy. We posit that interdisciplinary\ncollaboration is paramount to a more complete understanding of technical\nmeasures, which currently lacks a mutually accepted notion. Yet, as strongly\nsuggested by our results, there is still a lack of systematic approaches to\nsuch interaction. Therefore, the results strengthen our confidence in the need\nfor further investigations into the technical-legal dynamic of data privacy\ncompliance.",

Hyperspectral images (HSIs), through their narrow and contiguous\nbands, can assist in distinguishing tree species based on their spectral\nproperties. Therefore, automated classification algorithms on HSI images can\nhelp augment the limited labeled information and generate a real-time\nclassification map for various tree species. Achieving high classification\naccuracy with a limited amount of labeled information in an image is one of the\nkey challenges that researchers have started addressing in recent years. We\npropose a novel graph-regularized neural network (GRNN) algorithm that\nencompasses the superpixel-based segmentation for graph construction, a\npixel-wise neural network classifier, and the label propagation technique to\ngenerate an accurate classification map. GRNN outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art techniques not only for the standard Indian Pines HSI but also\nachieves a high classification accuracy (approx. 92%) on a new HSI data set\ncollected over the forests of French Guiana (FG) even when less than 1% of the\npixels are labeled.

A few\nworks have asked certain users to rate or select randomly recommended items,\ne.g., Yahoo!, Coat, and OpenBandit. However, these datasets are either too\nsmall in size or lack key information, such as unique user ID or the features\nof users/items. In this work, we present KuaiRand, an unbiased sequential\nrecommendation dataset containing millions of intervened interactions on\nrandomly exposed videos, collected from the video-sharing mobile App, Kuaishou.\nDifferent from existing datasets, KuaiRand records 12 kinds of user feedback\nsignals (e.g., click, like, and view time) on randomly exposed videos inserted\nin the recommendation feeds in two weeks. To facilitate model learning, we\nfurther collect rich features of users and items as well as users' behavior\nhistory. By releasing this dataset, we enable the research of advanced\ndebiasing large-scale recommendation scenarios for the first time.

    "abstract": "The security of deep learning (DL) systems is an extremely important field of\nstudy as they are being deployed in several applications due to their\never-improving performance to solve challenging tasks. Despite overwhelming\npromises, the deep learning systems are vulnerable to crafted adversarial\nexamples, which may be imperceptible to the human eye, but can lead the model\nto misclassify. Protections against adversarial perturbations on ensemble-based\ntechniques have either been shown to be vulnerable to stronger adversaries or\nshown to lack an end-to-end evaluation. In this paper, we attempt to develop a\nnew ensemble-based solution that constructs defender models with diverse\ndecision boundaries with respect to the original model. The ensemble of\nclassifiers constructed by (1) transformation of the input by a method called\nSplit-and-Shuffle, and (2) restricting the significant features by a method\ncalled Contrast-Significant-Features are shown to result in diverse gradients\nwith respect to adversarial attacks, which reduces the chance of transferring\nadversarial examples from the original to the defender model targeting the same\nclass. We present extensive experimentations using standard image\nclassification datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 against\nstate-of-the-art adversarial attacks to demonstrate the robustness of the\nproposed ensemble-based defense. We also evaluate the robustness in the\npresence of a stronger adversary targeting all the models within the ensemble\nsimultaneously.

In its simplest form, it states that if we have $n$ `bad\nevents', each of which occurs with probability at most $p$ and is independent\nof all but $d$ other events, then under certain criteria on $p$ and $d$, all of\nthe bad events can be avoided with positive probability.\nWhile the original proof was existential, there has been much study on the\nalgorithmic Lov\\'asz Local Lemma: that is, designing an algorithm which finds\nan assignment of the underlying random variables such that all the bad events\nare indeed avoided. Notably, the celebrated result of Moser and Tardos [JACM\n'10] also implied an efficient distributed algorithm for the problem, running\nin $O(\\log^2 n)$ rounds. For instances with low $d$, this was improved to\n$O(d^2+\\log^{O(1)}\\log n)$ by Fischer and Ghaffari [DISC '17], a result that\nhas proven highly important in distributed complexity theory (Chang and Pettie\n[SICOMP '19]).\nWe give an improved algorithm for the Lov\\'asz Local Lemma, providing a\ntrade-off between the strength of the criterion relating $p$ and $d$, and the\ndistributed round complexity. In particular, in the same regime as Fischer and\nGhaffari's algorithm, we improve the round complexity to $O(\\frac{d}{\\log\nd}+\\log^{O(1)}\\log n)$. At the other end of the trade-off, we obtain a\n$\\log^{O(1)}\\log n$ round complexity for a substantially wider regime than\npreviously known.\nAs our main application, we also give the first $\\log^{O(1)}\\log n$-round\ndistributed algorithm for the problem of $\\Delta+o(\\Delta)$-edge coloring a\ngraph of maximum degree $\\Delta$.

In an ideal pipeline, the end-to-end training\nthroughput is eventually limited by the throughput of the accelerator, not by\nthat of data preparation. In the past, the DNN training pipeline achieved a\nnear-optimal throughput by utilizing datasets encoded with a lightweight, lossy\nimage format like JPEG. However, as high-resolution, losslessly-encoded\ndatasets become more popular for applications requiring high accuracy, a\nperformance problem arises in the data preparation stage due to low-throughput\nimage decoding on the CPU. Thus, we propose L3, a custom lightweight, lossless\nimage format for high-resolution, high-throughput DNN training. The decoding\nprocess of L3 is effectively parallelized on the accelerator, thus minimizing\nCPU intervention for data preparation during DNN training. L3 achieves a 9.29x\nhigher data preparation throughput than PNG, the most popular lossless image\nformat, for the Cityscapes dataset on NVIDIA A100 GPU, which leads to 1.71x\nhigher end-to-end training throughput.

    "abstract": "Active inference provides a general framework for behavior and learning in\nautonomous agents. It states that an agent will attempt to minimize its\nvariational free energy, defined in terms of beliefs over observations,\ninternal states and policies. Traditionally, every aspect of a discrete active\ninference model must be specified by hand, i.e.\\ by manually defining the\nhidden state space structure, as well as the required distributions such as\nlikelihood and transition probabilities. Recently, efforts have been made to\nlearn state space representations automatically from observations using deep\nneural networks. However, these models are typically overparameterized, with\nthe risk of overfitting the data at hand. In this paper, we present a novel\napproach of learning state spaces using quantum physics-inspired tensor\nnetworks. The ability of tensor networks to represent the probabilistic nature\nof quantum states as well as to reduce large state spaces makes tensor networks\na natural candidate for active inference. We show how tensor networks can be\nused as a generative model for sequential data. Furthermore, we show how one\ncan obtain beliefs from such a generative model and how an active inference\nagent can use these to compute the expected free energy.

Our method is based on a dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) rigged\nby a mesh-based parametric 3D human model serving as a geometry proxy. Previous\nmethods usually rely on multi-view videos or accurate 3D geometry information\nas additional inputs; besides, most methods suffer from degraded quality when\ngeneralized to unseen poses. We identify that the key to generalization is a\ngood input embedding for querying dynamic NeRF: A good input embedding should\ndefine an injective mapping in the full volumetric space, guided by surface\nmesh deformation under pose variation. Based on this observation, we propose to\nembed the input query with its relationship to local surface regions spanned by\na set of geodesic nearest neighbors on mesh vertices. By including both\nposition and relative distance information, our embedding defines a\ndistance-preserved deformation mapping and generalizes well to unseen poses.

    "title": "Intelligent problem-solving as integrated hierarchical reinforcement  learning",
    "abstract": "According to cognitive psychology and related disciplines, the development of\ncomplex problem-solving behaviour in biological agents depends on hierarchical\ncognitive mechanisms. Hierarchical reinforcement learning is a promising\ncomputational approach that may eventually yield comparable problem-solving\nbehaviour in artificial agents and robots. However, to date the problem-solving\nabilities of many human and non-human animals are clearly superior to those of\nartificial systems. Here, we propose steps to integrate biologically inspired\nhierarchical mechanisms to enable advanced problem-solving skills in artificial\nagents. Therefore, we first review the literature in cognitive psychology to\nhighlight the importance of compositional abstraction and predictive\nprocessing. Then we relate the gained insights with contemporary hierarchical\nreinforcement learning methods. Interestingly, our results suggest that all\nidentified cognitive mechanisms have been implemented individually in isolated\ncomputational architectures, raising the question of why there exists no single\nunifying architecture that integrates them. As our final contribution, we\naddress this question by providing an integrative perspective on the\ncomputational challenges to develop such a unifying architecture. We expect our\nresults to guide the development of more sophisticated cognitively inspired\nhierarchical machine learning architectures.",

    "abstract": "Detecting tiny objects is one of the main obstacles hindering the development\nof object detection. The performance of generic object detectors tends to\ndrastically deteriorate on tiny object detection tasks. In this paper, we point\nout that either box prior in the anchor-based detector or point prior in the\nanchor-free detector is sub-optimal for tiny objects. Our key observation is\nthat the current anchor-based or anchor-free label assignment paradigms will\nincur many outlier tiny-sized ground truth samples, leading to detectors\nimposing less focus on the tiny objects. To this end, we propose a Gaussian\nReceptive Field based Label Assignment (RFLA) strategy for tiny object\ndetection. Specifically, RFLA first utilizes the prior information that the\nfeature receptive field follows Gaussian distribution. Then, instead of\nassigning samples with IoU or center sampling strategy, a new Receptive Field\nDistance (RFD) is proposed to directly measure the similarity between the\nGaussian receptive field and ground truth. Considering that the IoU-threshold\nbased and center sampling strategy are skewed to large objects, we further\ndesign a Hierarchical Label Assignment (HLA) module based on RFD to achieve\nbalanced learning for tiny objects. Extensive experiments on four datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Especially, our approach\noutperforms the state-of-the-art competitors with 4.0 AP points on the AI-TOD\ndataset. Codes are available at https://github.com/Chasel-Tsui/mmdet-rfla",

This research paradigm disproportionately ignores the larger\ngroup of non-technical end users of XAI, who do not have technical knowledge\nbut need explanations in their AI-assisted critical decisions. Lacking\nexplainability-focused functional support for end users may hinder the safe and\nresponsible use of AI in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare, criminal\njustice, finance, and autonomous driving systems. In this work, we explore how\ndesigning XAI tailored to end users' critical tasks inspires the framing of new\ntechnical problems. To elicit users' interpretations and requirements for XAI\nalgorithms, we first identify eight explanation forms as the communication tool\nbetween AI researchers and end users, such as explaining using features,\nexamples, or rules. Using the explanation forms, we then conduct a user study\nwith 32 layperson participants in the context of achieving different\nexplanation goals (such as verifying AI decisions, and improving user's\npredicted outcomes) in four critical tasks. Based on the user study findings,\nwe identify and formulate novel XAI technical problems, and propose an\nevaluation metric verifiability based on users' explanation goal of verifying\nAI decisions.

    "abstract": "Compared to traditional learning from scratch, knowledge distillation\nsometimes makes the DNN achieve superior performance. This paper provides a new\nperspective to explain the success of knowledge distillation, i.e., quantifying\nknowledge points encoded in intermediate layers of a DNN for classification,\nbased on the information theory. To this end, we consider the signal processing\nin a DNN as the layer-wise information discarding. A knowledge point is\nreferred to as an input unit, whose information is much less discarded than\nother input units. Thus, we propose three hypotheses for knowledge distillation\nbased on the quantification of knowledge points. 1. The DNN learning from\nknowledge distillation encodes more knowledge points than the DNN learning from\nscratch. 2. Knowledge distillation makes the DNN more likely to learn different\nknowledge points simultaneously. In comparison, the DNN learning from scratch\ntends to encode various knowledge points sequentially. 3. The DNN learning from\nknowledge distillation is often optimized more stably than the DNN learning\nfrom scratch. In order to verify the above hypotheses, we design three types of\nmetrics with annotations of foreground objects to analyze feature\nrepresentations of the DNN, \\textit{i.e.} the quantity and the quality of\nknowledge points, the learning speed of different knowledge points, and the\nstability of optimization directions. In experiments, we diagnosed various DNNs\nfor different classification tasks, i.e., image classification, 3D point cloud\nclassification, binary sentiment classification, and question answering, which\nverified above hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "Email phishing has become more prevalent and grows more sophisticated over\ntime. To combat this rise, many machine learning (ML) algorithms for detecting\nphishing emails have been developed. However, due to the limited email data\nsets on which these algorithms train, they are not adept at recognising varied\nattacks and, thus, suffer from concept drift; attackers can introduce small\nchanges in the statistical characteristics of their emails or websites to\nsuccessfully bypass detection. Over time, a gap develops between the reported\naccuracy from literature and the algorithm's actual effectiveness in the real\nworld. This realises itself in frequent false positive and false negative\nclassifications.\nTo this end, we propose a multidimensional risk assessment of emails to\nreduce the feasibility of an attacker adapting their email and avoiding\ndetection. This horizontal approach to email phishing detection profiles an\nincoming email on its main features. We develop a risk assessment framework\nthat includes three models which analyse an email's (1) threat level, (2)\ncognitive manipulation, and (3) email type, which we combine to return the\nfinal risk assessment score. The Profiler does not require large data sets to\ntrain on to be effective and its analysis of varied email features reduces the\nimpact of concept drift. Our Profiler can be used in conjunction with ML\napproaches, to reduce their misclassifications or as a labeller for large email\ndata sets in the training stage.\nWe evaluate the efficacy of the Profiler against a machine learning ensemble\nusing state-of-the-art ML algorithms on a data set of 9000 legitimate and 900\nphishing emails from a large Australian research organisation. Our results\nindicate that the Profiler's mitigates the impact of concept drift, and\ndelivers 30% less false positive and 25% less false negative email\nclassifications over the ML ensemble's approach.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the attention-enhanced multi-layer encoder, such as Transformer,\nhas been extensively studied in Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). To predict\nthe answer, it is common practice to employ a predictor to draw information\nonly from the final encoder layer which generates the coarse-grained\nrepresentations of the source sequences, i.e., passage and question. The\nanalysis shows that the representation of source sequence becomes more\ncoarse-grained from finegrained as the encoding layer increases. It is\ngenerally believed that with the growing number of layers in deep neural\nnetworks, the encoding process will gather relevant information for each\nlocation increasingly, resulting in more coarse-grained representations, which\nadds the likelihood of similarity to other locations (referring to\nhomogeneity). Such phenomenon will mislead the model to make wrong judgement\nand degrade the performance. In this paper, we argue that it would be better if\nthe predictor could exploit representations of different granularity from the\nencoder, providing different views of the source sequences, such that the\nexpressive power of the model could be fully utilized. To this end, we propose\na novel approach called Adaptive Bidirectional Attention-Capsule Network\n(ABA-Net), which adaptively exploits the source representations of different\nlevels to the predictor. Furthermore, due to the better representations are at\nthe core for boosting MRC performance, the capsule network and self-attention\nmodule are carefully designed as the building blocks of our encoders, which\nprovides the capability to explore the local and global representations,\nrespectively. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets, i.e., SQuAD\n1.0, SQuAD 2.0 and COQA, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In\nparticular, we set the new state-of-the-art performance on the SQuAD 1.0\ndataset",

    "abstract": "Travel has been challenging recently since different nations have implemented\nvaried immigration and travel policies. For the time being, immigration\nofficials want proof of each person's immunity to the virus. A vaccine passport\nserves as evidence that a person has tested negative for or is immune to a\nparticular virus. In terms of COVID-19, those who hold a vaccine passport will\nbe permitted entry into other nations as long as they can provide proof that\nthey have COVID-19 antibodies from prior infections or from full COVID-19\nimmunizations. To reduce time and effort spent managing data, the vaccination\npassport system has been digitalized. The process of contact tracing may be\nfacilitated by digitization. The \"Blockchain technology\" system, which is\ncurrently in use, has demonstrated its security and privacy in systems for data\nexchange among bitcoin users. The Digital Vaccination Passport scheme can use\nBlockchain technology. The end result would be a decentralized, traceable,\ntransparent, reliable, auditable, secure, and trustworthy solution based on the\nEthereum block-chain that would allow tracking of vaccines given and the\nhistory of diseases.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) trains machine learning (ML) models on devices using\nlocally generated data and exchanges models without transferring raw data to a\ndistant server. This exchange incurs a communication overhead and impacts the\nperformance of FL training. There is limited understanding of how communication\nprotocols specifically contribute to the performance of FL. Such an\nunderstanding is essential for selecting the right communication protocol when\ndesigning an FL system. This paper presents FedComm, a benchmarking methodology\nto quantify the impact of optimized application layer protocols, namely Message\nQueue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), and\nZeroMQ Message Transport Protocol (ZMTP), and non-optimized application layer\nprotocols, namely as TCP and UDP, on the performance of FL. FedComm measures\nthe overall performance of FL in terms of communication time and accuracy under\nvarying computational and network stress and packet loss rates. Experiments on\na lab-based testbed demonstrate that TCP outperforms UDP as a non-optimized\napplication layer protocol with higher accuracy and shorter communication times\nfor 4G and Wi-Fi networks. Optimized application layer protocols such as AMQP,\nMQTT, and ZMTP outperformed non-optimized application layer protocols in most\nnetwork conditions, resulting in a 2.5x reduction in communication time\ncompared to TCP while maintaining accuracy. The experimental results enable us\nto highlight a number of open research issues for further investigation.\nFedComm is available for download from https://github.com/qub-blesson/FedComm.",

Second, a high-resolution texture\ncompletion network, that utilizes the predicted coarse vertex textures to\ninpaint the missing parts of the partial 'texture atlas'. A Thorough\nexperimental evaluation on 3DBodyTex.V2 dataset shows that our method achieves\ncompetitive results with respect to the state-of-the-art while generalizing to\ndifferent types and levels of partial shapes.

Partial convolutions can be added as layers to other\ntypes of neural networks, making it relatively easy to integrate with existing\ndeep learning models.

Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), which iteratively\nsamples the farthest point and performs distance updating, is one of the most\npopular sampling schemes. Unfortunately it suffers from low efficiency and can\nbecome the bottleneck of point cloud applications. We propose adjustable FPS\n(AFPS), parameterized by M, to aggressively reduce the complexity of FPS\nwithout compromising on the sampling performance. Specifically, it divides the\noriginal point cloud into M small point clouds and samples M points\nsimultaneously. It exploits the dimensional locality of an approximately sorted\npoint cloud data to minimize its performance degradation. AFPS method can\nachieve 22 to 30x speedup over original FPS. Furthermore, we propose the\nnearest-point-distance-updating (NPDU) method to limit the number of distance\nupdates to a constant number. The combined NPDU on AFPS method can achieve a\n34-280x speedup on a point cloud with 2K-32K points with algorithmic\nperformance that is comparable to the original FPS.

In mathematical theory, most often lattices over real numbers are\nconsidered. However, in communications, complex-valued processing is usually of\ninterest. Besides, by the use of dual-polarized transmission as well as by the\ncombination of two time slots or frequencies, four-dimensional\n(quaternion-valued) approaches become more and more important. Hence, to\naccount for this fact, well-known lattice algorithms and related concepts are\ngeneralized in this work. To this end, a brief review of complex arithmetic,\nincluding the sets of Gaussian and Eisenstein integers, and an introduction to\nquaternion-valued numbers, including the sets of Lipschitz and Hurwitz\nintegers, are given. On that basis, generalized variants of two important\nalgorithms are derived: first, of the polynomial-time LLL algorithm, resulting\nin a reduced basis of a lattice by performing a special variant of the\nEuclidean algorithm defined for matrices, and second, of an algorithm to\ncalculate the successive minima - the norms of the shortest independent vectors\nof a lattice - and its related lattice points. Generalized bounds for the\nquality of the particular results are established and the asymptotic\ncomplexities of the algorithms are assessed. These findings are extensively\ncompared to conventional real-valued processing. It is shown that the\ngeneralized approaches outperform their real-valued counterparts in complexity\nand/or quality aspects.

In this context, we\npropose SMTQUERY: an SMT-LIB benchmark analysis tool for string constraints.\nSMTQUERY is implemented in Python 3, and offers a collection of analysis and\ninformation extraction tools for a comprehensive data base of string benchmarks\n(presented in SMT-LIB format), based on an SQL-centred language called QLANG.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art object pose estimation handles multiple instances in a test\nimage by using multi-model formulations: detection as a first stage and then\nseparately trained networks per object for 2D-3D geometric correspondence\nprediction as a second stage. Poses are subsequently estimated using the\nPerspective-n-Points algorithm at runtime. Unfortunately, multi-model\nformulations are slow and do not scale well with the number of object instances\ninvolved. Recent approaches show that direct 6D object pose estimation is\nfeasible when derived from the aforementioned geometric correspondences. We\npresent an approach that learns an intermediate geometric representation of\nmultiple objects to directly regress 6D poses of all instances in a test image.\nThe inherent end-to-end trainability overcomes the requirement of separately\nprocessing individual object instances. By calculating the mutual\nIntersection-over-Unions, pose hypotheses are clustered into distinct\ninstances, which achieves negligible runtime overhead with respect to the\nnumber of object instances. Results on multiple challenging standard datasets\nshow that the pose estimation performance is superior to single-model\nstate-of-the-art approaches despite being more than ~35 times faster.

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation is of huge interest as labeling is an expensive and\nerror-prone task, especially when labels are needed on pixel-level like in\nsemantic segmentation. Therefore, one would like to be able to train neural\nnetworks on synthetic domains, where data is abundant and labels are precise.\nHowever, these models often perform poorly on out-of-domain images. To mitigate\nthe shift in the input, image-to-image approaches can be used. Nevertheless,\nstandard image-to-image approaches that bridge the domain of deployment with\nthe synthetic training domain do not focus on the downstream task but only on\nthe visual inspection level. We therefore propose a \"task aware\" version of a\nGAN in an image-to-image domain adaptation approach. With the help of a small\namount of labeled ground truth data, we guide the image-to-image translation to\na more suitable input image for a semantic segmentation network trained on\nsynthetic data (synthetic-domain expert). The main contributions of this work\nare 1) a modular semi-supervised domain adaptation method for semantic\nsegmentation by training a downstream task aware CycleGAN while refraining from\nadapting the synthetic semantic segmentation expert 2) the demonstration that\nthe method is applicable to complex domain adaptation tasks and 3) a less\nbiased domain gap analysis by using from scratch networks.

It is a crucial component of active defense\nagainst advanced persistent threats (APTs). However, most of the current threat\nhunting methods rely on Cyber Threat Intelligence(CTI), which can find known\nattacks but cannot find unknown attacks that have not been disclosed by CTI. In\nthis paper, we propose LogKernel, a threat hunting method based on graph kernel\nclustering which can effectively separates attack behaviour from benign\nactivities. LogKernel first abstracts system audit logs into Behaviour\nProvenance Graphs (BPGs), and then clusters graphs by embedding them into a\ncontinuous space using a graph kernel. In particular, we design a new graph\nkernel clustering method based on the characteristics of BPGs, which can\ncapture structure information and rich label information of the BPGs. To reduce\nfalse positives, LogKernel further quantifies the threat of abnormal behaviour.\nWe evaluate LogKernel on the malicious dataset which includes seven simulated\nattack scenarios and the DAPRA CADETS dataset which includes four attack\nscenarios. The result shows that LogKernel can hunt all attack scenarios among\nthem, and compared to the state-of-the-art methods, it can find unknown\nattacks.",

Due to complex\nand mixed use, it is challenging for accurate land use mapping from widely-used\nremote sensing images (RSI) directly, especially for high-density cities. To\naddress this issue, in this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine machine\nlearning-based approach for parcel-level urban land use mapping, integrating\nmultisource geospatial data, including RSI, points-of-interest (POI), and\narea-of-interest (AOI) data.

Then, we adopt different classification strategies for parcels in\ndifferent regions, and finally combine the classified results into an\nintegrated land use map. The results show that the proposed approach can\nsignificantly outperform baseline method that mixes built-up and non-built-up\nregions, with accuracy increase of 25% and 30% for level-1 and level-2\nclassification, respectively. In addition, we examine the rarely explored AOI\ndata, which can further boost the level-1 and level-2 classification accuracy\nby 13% and 14%.

    "abstract": "Recent trackers adopt the Transformer to combine or replace the widely used\nResNet as their new backbone network. Although their trackers work well in\nregular scenarios, however, they simply flatten the 2D features into a sequence\nto better match the Transformer. We believe these operations ignore the spatial\nprior of the target object which may lead to sub-optimal results only. In\naddition, many works demonstrate that self-attention is actually a low-pass\nfilter, which is independent of input features or key/queries. That is to say,\nit may suppress the high-frequency component of the input features and preserve\nor even amplify the low-frequency information. To handle these issues, in this\npaper, we propose a unified Spatial-Frequency Transformer that models the\nGaussian spatial Prior and High-frequency emphasis Attention (GPHA)\nsimultaneously. To be specific, Gaussian spatial prior is generated using dual\nMulti-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and injected into the similarity matrix produced\nby multiplying Query and Key features in self-attention. The output will be fed\ninto a Softmax layer and then decomposed into two components, i.e., the direct\nsignal and high-frequency signal. The low- and high-pass branches are rescaled\nand combined to achieve all-pass, therefore, the high-frequency features will\nbe protected well in stacked self-attention layers. We further integrate the\nSpatial-Frequency Transformer into the Siamese tracking framework and propose a\nnovel tracking algorithm, termed SFTransT. The cross-scale fusion based\nSwinTransformer is adopted as the backbone, and also a multi-head\ncross-attention module is used to boost the interaction between search and\ntemplate features. The output will be fed into the tracking head for target\nlocalization.

The users, in turn, harvest energy from the received signal and\nutilize it for information transmission in the uplink. Furthermore, to jointly\noptimize the energy signal waveform and downlink beamforming, we assume that\nthe BS broadcasts a pulse-modulated signal employing multiple energy signal\nvectors. We formulate an optimization problem for the joint design of the\ndownlink transmit energy signal vectors, their number, the durations of the\ntransmit pulses, and the time allocation policy for minimization of the average\ntransmit power at the BS. We show that for single-user WPCNs, a single energy\nsignal vector, which is collinear with the maximum ratio transmission (MRT)\nvector and drives the EH circuit at the user device into saturation, is\noptimal. Next, for the general multi-user case, we show that the optimal signal\ndesign requires a maximum number of energy signal vectors that exceeds the\nnumber of users by one and propose an algorithm to obtain the optimal energy\nsignal vectors. Since the complexity of the optimal design is high, we also\npropose two suboptimal schemes for WPCN design. First, for asymptotic massive\nWPCNs, where the ratio of the number of users to the number of BS antennas,\ni.e., the system load, tends to zero, we show that the optimal downlink\ntransmit signal can be obtained in closed-form and comprises a sequence of\nweighted sums of MRT vectors.

    "abstract": "The SSH protocol is commonly used to access remote systems on the Internet,\nas it provides an encrypted and authenticated channel for communication. If\nupon establishing a new connection, the presented server key is unknown to the\nclient, the user is asked to verify the key fingerprint manually, which is\nprone to errors and often blindly trusted. The SSH standard describes an\nalternative to such manual key verification: using the Domain Name System (DNS)\nto publish the server key information in SSHFP records.\nIn this paper, we conduct a large-scale Internet study to measure the\nprevalence of SSHFP records among DNS domain names. We scan the Tranco 1M list\nand over 500 million names from the certificate transparency log over the\ncourse of 26 days. The results show that in two studied populations, about 1 in\n10,000 domains has SSHFP records, with more than half of them deployed without\nusing DNSSEC, drastically reducing security benefits.",

In this paper, we\npropose a simple but effective approach, neighbor aggregation via inverse\npropensity (Navip) for GNNs. Specifically, given a user-item bipartite graph,\nwe first derive propensity score of each user-item interaction in the graph.\nThen, inverse of the propensity score with Laplacian normalization is applied\nto debias neighbor aggregation from exposure bias. We validate the\neffectiveness of our approach through our extensive experiments on two public\nand Amazon Alexa datasets where the performance enhances up to 14.2%.",

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal and neurological disorders are the most common causes of\nwalking problems among older people, and they often lead to diminished quality\nof life. Analyzing walking motion data manually requires trained professionals\nand the evaluations may not always be objective. To facilitate early diagnosis,\nrecent deep learning-based methods have shown promising results for automated\nanalysis, which can discover patterns that have not been found in traditional\nmachine learning methods. We observe that existing work mostly applies deep\nlearning on individual joint features such as the time series of joint\npositions. Due to the challenge of discovering inter-joint features such as the\ndistance between feet (i.e. the stride width) from generally smaller-scale\nmedical datasets, these methods usually perform sub-optimally. As a result, we\npropose a solution that explicitly takes both individual joint features and\ninter-joint features as input, relieving the system from the need of\ndiscovering more complicated features from small data. Due to the distinctive\nnature of the two types of features, we introduce a two-stream framework, with\none stream learning from the time series of joint position and the other from\nthe time series of relative joint displacement. We further develop a mid-layer\nfusion module to combine the discovered patterns in these two streams for\ndiagnosis, which results in a complementary representation of the data for\nbetter prediction performance. We validate our system with a benchmark dataset\nof 3D skeleton motion that involves 45 patients with musculoskeletal and\nneurological disorders, and achieve a prediction accuracy of 95.56%,\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal forecasting is an imperative topic in data science due to its\ndiverse and critical applications in smart cities. Existing works mostly\nperform consecutive predictions of following steps with observations completely\nand continuously obtained, where nearest observations can be exploited as key\nknowledge for instantaneous status estimation. However, the practical issues of\nearly activity planning and sensor failures elicit a brand-new task, i.e.,\nnon-consecutive forecasting. In this paper, we define spatiotemporal learning\nsystems with missing observation as Grey Spatiotemporal Systems (G2S) and\npropose a Factor-Decoupled learning framework for G2S (FDG2S), where the core\nidea is to hierarchically decouple multi-level factors and enable both flexible\naggregations and disentangled uncertainty estimations. Firstly, to compensate\nfor missing observations, a generic semantic-neighboring sequence sampling is\ndevised, which selects representative sequences to capture both periodical\nregularity and instantaneous variations. Secondly, we turn the predictions of\nnon-consecutive statuses into inferring statuses under expected combined\nexogenous factors. In particular, a factor-decoupled aggregation scheme is\nproposed to decouple factor-induced predictive intensity and region-wise\nproximity by two energy functions of conditional random field. To infer\nregion-wise proximity under flexible factor-wise combinations and enable\ndynamic neighborhood aggregations, we further disentangle compounded influences\nof exogenous factors on region-wise proximity and learn to aggregate them.\nGiven the inherent incompleteness and critical applications of G2S, a\nDisEntangled Uncertainty Quantification is put forward, to identify two types\nof uncertainty for reliability guarantees and model interpretations.",

These applications commonly require knowing the pose of surgical\ntools and patients to provide visual information that surgeons can use during\nthe task performance. Existing medical-grade tracking systems use infrared\ncameras placed inside the Operating Room (OR) to identify retro-reflective\nmarkers attached to objects of interest and compute their pose. Some\ncommercially available AR Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) use similar cameras for\nself-localization, hand tracking, and estimating the objects' depth. This work\npresents a framework that uses the built-in cameras of AR HMDs to enable\naccurate tracking of retro-reflective markers, such as those used in surgical\nprocedures, without the need to integrate any additional components. This\nframework is also capable of simultaneously tracking multiple tools. Our\nresults show that the tracking and detection of the markers can be achieved\nwith an accuracy of 0.09 +- 0.06 mm on lateral translation, 0.42 +- 0.32 mm on\nlongitudinal translation, and 0.80 +- 0.39 deg for rotations around the\nvertical axis. Furthermore, to showcase the relevance of the proposed\nframework, we evaluate the system's performance in the context of surgical\nprocedures.

This\nraises ethical concerns, as it has adversely affected minorities and\nhistorically discriminated groups. In this paper, we use an approach that\ncombines statistics and machine learning with dynamical modeling to assess\nlong-term fairness effects of labor market interventions. Specifically, we\ndevelop and use a model to investigate the impact of decisions caused by a\npublic employment authority that selectively supports job-seekers through\ntargeted help. The selection of who receives what help is based on a\ndata-driven intervention model that estimates an individual's chances of\nfinding a job in a timely manner and is based on data that describes a\npopulation in which skills relevant to the labor market are unevenly\ndistributed between two groups (e.g., males and females). The intervention\nmodel has incomplete access to the individual's actual skills and can augment\nthis with knowledge of the individual's group affiliation, thus using a\nprotected attribute to increase predictive accuracy. We assess this\nintervention model's dynamics -- especially fairness-related issues and\ntrade-offs between different fairness goals -- over time and compare it to an\nintervention model that does not use group affiliation as a predictive feature.\nWe conclude that in order to quantify the trade-off correctly and to assess the\nlong-term fairness effects of such a system in the real-world, careful modeling\nof the surrounding labor market is indispensable.",

These\ntrends suggest a need for a paradigm shift towards a data-centric approach\nwhere computation is performed close to where the data resides. Further, a\ndata-centric approach can enable a data-driven view where we take advantage of\nvast amounts of available data to improve architectural decisions.\nAs a step towards modern architectures, this dissertation contributes to\nvarious aspects of the data-centric approach and proposes several data-driven\nmechanisms.\nFirst, we design NERO, a data-centric accelerator for a real-world weather\nprediction application. Second, we explore the applicability of different\nnumber formats, including fixed-point, floating-point, and posit, for different\nstencil kernels. Third, we propose NAPEL, an ML-based application performance\nand energy prediction framework for data-centric architectures. Fourth, we\npresent LEAPER, the first use of few-shot learning to transfer FPGA-based\ncomputing models across different hardware platforms and applications. Fifth,\nwe propose Sibyl, the first reinforcement learning-based mechanism for data\nplacement in hybrid storage systems.\nOverall, this thesis provides two key conclusions: (1) hardware acceleration\non an FPGA+HBM fabric is a promising solution to overcome the data movement\nbottleneck of our current computing systems; (2) data should drive system and\ndesign decisions by leveraging inherent data characteristics to make our\ncomputing systems more efficient.",

    "title": "Brand Celebrity Matching Model Based on Natural Language Processing",
    "abstract": "Celebrity Endorsement is one of the most significant strategies in brand\ncommunication. Nowadays, more and more companies try to build a vivid\ncharacteristic for themselves. Therefore, their brand identity communications\nshould accord with some characteristics as humans and regulations. However, the\nprevious works mostly stop by assumptions, instead of proposing a specific way\nto perform matching between brands and celebrities. In this paper, we propose a\nbrand celebrity matching model (BCM) based on Natural Language Processing (NLP)\ntechniques. Given a brand and a celebrity, we firstly obtain some descriptive\ndocuments of them from the Internet, then summarize these documents, and\nfinally calculate a matching degree between the brand and the celebrity to\ndetermine whether they are matched. According to the experimental result, our\nproposed model outperforms the best baselines with a 0.362 F1 score and 6.3% of\naccuracy, which indicates the effectiveness and application value of our model\nin the real-world scene. What's more, to our best knowledge, the proposed BCM\nmodel is the first work on using NLP to solve endorsement issues, so it can\nprovide some novel research ideas and methodologies for the following works.",

In fine-grained classification, the necessity\nis to discover subtle differences due to the high level of similarity between\nsub-classes. Such distinctions are often lost as we downscale the image to save\nthe memory and computational cost associated with vision transformers (ViT). In\nthis work, we present an in-depth analysis and describe the critical components\nfor developing a system for the fine-grained categorization of plants from\nherbarium sheets. Our extensive experimental analysis indicated the need for a\nbetter augmentation technique and the ability of modern-day neural networks to\nhandle higher dimensional images. We also introduce a convolutional transformer\narchitecture called Conviformer which, unlike the popular Vision Transformer\n(ConViT), can handle higher resolution images without exploding memory and\ncomputational cost. We also introduce a novel, improved pre-processing\ntechnique called PreSizer to resize images better while preserving their\noriginal aspect ratios, which proved essential for classifying natural plants.\nWith our simple yet effective approach, we achieved SoTA on Herbarium 202x and\niNaturalist 2019 dataset.",

    "abstract": "Research in machine learning for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)\nclassification bears the promise to improve clinical diagnoses. However, recent\nstudies in clinical imaging have shown the limited generalization of biomarkers\nacross and beyond benchmark datasets. Despite increasing model complexity and\nsample size in neuroimaging, the classification performance of ASD remains far\naway from clinical application. This raises the question of how we can overcome\nthese barriers to develop early biomarkers for ASD. One approach might be to\nrethink how we operationalize the theoretical basis of this disease in machine\nlearning models. Here we introduced unsupervised graph representations that\nexplicitly map the neural mechanisms of a core aspect of ASD, deficits in\ndyadic social interaction, as assessed by dual brain recordings, termed\nhyperscanning, and evaluated their predictive performance. The proposed method\ndiffers from existing approaches in that it is more suitable to capture social\ninteraction deficits on a neural level and is applicable to young children and\ninfants. First results from functional-near infrared spectroscopy data indicate\npotential predictive capacities of a task-agnostic, interpretable graph\nrepresentation. This first effort to leverage interaction-related deficits on\nneural level to classify ASD may stimulate new approaches and methods to\nenhance existing models to achieve developmental ASD biomarkers in the future.",

Besides weather models, in-situ measurements and\nremote sensing technologies, especially satellite sensors, provide\ncomplementary means to monitor wind speed. As sea surface winds produce sounds\nthat propagate underwater, underwater acoustics recordings can also deliver\nfine-grained wind-related information. Whereas model-driven schemes, especially\ndata assimilation approaches, are the state-of-the-art schemes to address\ninverse problems in geoscience, machine learning techniques become more and\nmore appealing to fully exploit the potential of observation datasets.

In the decision version\nof the problem, we are to check if any such occurrence exists. All previous\nresults for approximate CPM were either average-case upper bounds or\nheuristics, except for the work of Charalampopoulos et al.

For the reporting version of the\napproximate CPM problem, under the Hamming distance we improve upon the main\nalgorithm of [CKP$^+$, JCSS'21] from ${\\cal O}(n+(n/m)\\cdot k^4)$ to ${\\cal\nO}(n+(n/m)\\cdot k^3\\log\\log k)$ time; for the edit distance, we give an ${\\cal\nO}(nk^2)$-time algorithm. We also consider the decision version of the\napproximate CPM problem.

Third, we develop an object detection\nmodel to predict land application and a system to perform inference in near\nreal-time. We show that this system effectively appears to detect land\napplication (PR AUC = 0.93) and we uncover several outlier facilities which\nappear to apply regularly and excessively. Last, we estimate the population\nprevalence of land application events in Winter 2021/22. We show that the\nprevalence of land application is much higher than what is self-reported by\nfacilities. The system can be used by environmental regulators and interest\ngroups, one of which piloted field visits based on this system this past\nwinter.

We introduce a control\nalgorithm that minimizes dynamic regret, i.e., that minimizes the suboptimality\nagainst an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows the unpredictable future a\npriori. Specifically, our algorithm minimizes the worst-case dynamic regret\namong all possible noise realizations given a worst-case total noise magnitude.\nTo this end, the control algorithm accounts for three key challenges: safety\nconstraints; partially-observed time-varying systems; and unpredictable process\nand measurement noise. We are motivated by the future of autonomy where robots\nwill autonomously perform complex tasks despite unknown and unpredictable\ndisturbances leveraging their on-board control and perception capabilities. To\nsynthesize our minimal-regret perception-based controller, we formulate a\nconstrained semi-definite program based on a System Level Synthesis approach we\nenable for partially-observed time-varying systems. We validate our algorithm\nin simulated scenarios, including trajectory tracking scenarios of a hovering\nquadrotor collecting GPS and IMU measurements and of an omnidirectional robot\ncollecting range measurements from landmarks.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables independent parties to collaboratively build\nmachine learning (ML) models while protecting data privacy. Vertical federated\nlearning (VFL), a variant of FL, has recently drawn increasing attention as the\nVFL matches the enterprises' demands of leveraging more valuable features to\nachieve better model performance without jeopardizing data privacy. However,\nconventional VFL may run into data deficiency as it is only able to exploit\naligned samples (belonging to different parties) with labels, leaving often the\nmajority of unaligned and unlabeled samples unused. The data deficiency hampers\nthe effort of the federation. In this work, we propose a Federated Hybrid\nSelf-Supervised Learning framework, coined FedHSSL, to utilize all available\ndata (including unaligned and unlabeled samples) of participants to train the\njoint VFL model. The core idea of FedHSSL is to utilize cross-party views\n(i.e., dispersed features) of samples aligned among parties and local views\n(i.e., augmentations) of samples within each party to improve the\nrepresentation learning capability of the joint VFL model through SSL (e.g.,\nSimSiam). FedHSSL further exploits generic features shared among parties to\nboost the performance of the joint model through partial model aggregation. We\nempirically demonstrate that our FedHSSL achieves significant performance gains\ncompared with baseline methods, especially when the number of labeled samples\nis small. We provide an in-depth analysis of FedHSSL regarding privacy leakage,\nwhich is rarely discussed in existing self-supervised VFL works. We investigate\nthe protection mechanism for FedHSSL.

However, re-ranking pipelines are\ninherently limited by the recall of the initial candidate pool; documents that\nare not identified as candidates for re-ranking by the initial retrieval\nfunction cannot be identified. We propose a novel approach for overcoming the\nrecall limitation based on the well-established clustering hypothesis.\nThroughout the re-ranking process, our approach adds documents to the pool that\nare most similar to the highest-scoring documents up to that point. This\nfeedback process adapts the pool of candidates to those that may also yield\nhigh ranking scores, even if they were not present in the initial pool. It can\nalso increase the score of documents that appear deeper in the pool that would\nhave otherwise been skipped due to a limited re-ranking budget. We find that\nour Graph-based Adaptive Re-ranking (GAR) approach significantly improves the\nperformance of re-ranking pipelines in terms of precision- and recall-oriented\nmeasures, is complementary to a variety of existing techniques (e.g., dense\nretrieval), is robust to its hyperparameters, and contributes minimally to\ncomputational and storage costs.

The state of\ncharge management when energy storage is used for multiple services, such as\noptimal scheduling and frequency support, is one of the most notorious problems\nin this context.

    "abstract": "External knowledge,e.g., entities and entity descriptions, can help humans\nunderstand texts. Many works have been explored to include external knowledge\nin the pre-trained models. These methods, generally, design pre-training tasks\nand implicitly introduce knowledge by updating model weights, alternatively,\nuse it straightforwardly together with the original text. Though effective,\nthere are some limitations. On the one hand, it is implicit and only model\nweights are paid attention to, the pre-trained entity embeddings are ignored.\nOn the other hand, entity descriptions may be lengthy, and inputting into the\nmodel together with the original text may distract the model's attention. This\npaper aims to explicitly include both entities and entity descriptions in the\nfine-tuning stage. First, the pre-trained entity embeddings are fused with the\noriginal text representation and updated by the backbone model layer by layer.\nSecond, descriptions are represented by the knowledge module outside the\nbackbone model, and each knowledge layer is selectively connected to one\nbackbone layer for fusing. Third, two knowledge-related auxiliary tasks, i.e.,\nentity/description enhancement and entity enhancement/pollution task, are\ndesigned to smooth the semantic gaps among evolved representations. We\nconducted experiments on four knowledge-oriented tasks and two common tasks,\nand the results achieved new state-of-the-art on several datasets.

    "abstract": "Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR) aims to generate structured semantic\nsummaries of images for ``human-like'' event understanding. Specifically, GSR\ntask not only detects the salient activity verb (e.g. buying), but also\npredicts all corresponding semantic roles (e.g. agent and goods). Inspired by\nobject detection and image captioning tasks, existing methods typically employ\na two-stage framework: 1) detect the activity verb, and then 2) predict\nsemantic roles based on the detected verb. Obviously, this illogical framework\nconstitutes a huge obstacle to semantic understanding. First, pre-detecting\nverbs solely without semantic roles inevitably fails to distinguish many\nsimilar daily activities (e.g., offering and giving, buying and selling).\nSecond, predicting semantic roles in a closed auto-regressive manner can hardly\nexploit the semantic relations among the verb and roles. To this end, in this\npaper we propose a novel two-stage framework that focuses on utilizing such\nbidirectional relations within verbs and roles. In the first stage, instead of\npre-detecting the verb, we postpone the detection step and assume a pseudo\nlabel, where an intermediate representation for each corresponding semantic\nrole is learned from images. In the second stage, we exploit transformer layers\nto unearth the potential semantic relations within both verbs and semantic\nroles. With the help of a set of support images, an alternate learning scheme\nis designed to simultaneously optimize the results: update the verb using nouns\ncorresponding to the image, and update nouns using verbs from support images.\nExtensive experimental results on challenging SWiG benchmarks show that our\nrenovated framework outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under various\nmetrics.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we tackle a new computer vision task, open-vocabulary panoptic\nsegmentation, that aims to perform panoptic segmentation (background semantic\nlabeling + foreground instance segmentation) for arbitrary categories of\ntext-based descriptions. We first build a baseline method without finetuning\nnor distillation to utilize the knowledge in the existing CLIP model. We then\ndevelop a new method, MaskCLIP, that is a Transformer-based approach using mask\nqueries with the ViT-based CLIP backbone to perform semantic segmentation and\nobject instance segmentation. Here we design a Relative Mask Attention (RMA)\nmodule to account for segmentations as additional tokens to the ViT CLIP model.\nMaskCLIP learns to efficiently and effectively utilize pre-trained dense/local\nCLIP features by avoiding the time-consuming operation to crop image patches\nand compute feature from an external CLIP image model. We obtain encouraging\nresults for open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation and state-of-the-art results\nfor open-vocabulary semantic segmentation on ADE20K and PASCAL datasets. We\nshow qualitative illustration for MaskCLIP with custom categories.",

We then evaluated both models on fMRI data where\nsubjects observed animals and objects.

    "abstract": "Estimating individual treatment effects (ITEs) from observational data is\nrelevant in many fields such as personalized medicine. However, in practice,\nthe treatment assignment is usually confounded by unobserved variables and thus\nintroduces bias. A remedy to remove the bias is the use of instrumental\nvariables (IVs). Such settings are widespread in medicine (e.g., trials where\ncompliance is used as binary IV). In this paper, we propose a novel, multiply\nrobust machine learning framework, called MRIV, for estimating ITEs using\nbinary IVs and thus yield an unbiased ITE estimator. Different from previous\nwork for binary IVs, our framework estimates the ITE directly via a pseudo\noutcome regression. (1) We provide a theoretical analysis where we show that\nour framework yields multiply robust convergence rates: our ITE estimator\nachieves fast convergence even if several nuisance estimators converge slowly.\n(2) We further show that our framework asymptotically outperforms\nstate-of-the-art plug-in IV methods for ITE estimation. (3) We build upon our\ntheoretical results and propose a tailored deep neural network architecture\ncalled MRIV-Net for ITE estimation using binary IVs. Across various\ncomputational experiments, we demonstrate empirically that our MRIV-Net\nachieves state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "The overheads of classical decoding for quantum error correction grow rapidly\nwith the number of logical qubits and their correction code distance. Decoding\nat room temperature is bottle-necked by refrigerator I/O bandwidth while\ncryogenic on-chip decoding is limited by area/power/thermal budget.\nTo overcome these overheads, we are motivated by the observation that in the\ncommon case (over 90% of the time), error signatures are fairly trivial with\nhigh redundancy / sparsity, since the error correction codes are\nover-provisioned to be able to correct for uncommon worst-case complex\nscenarios (to ensure substantially low logical error rates). If suitably\nexploited, these trivial signatures can be decoded and corrected with\ninsignificant overhead, thereby alleviating the bottlenecks described above,\nwhile still handling the worst-case complex signatures by state-of-the-art\nmeans.\nOur proposal, targeting Surface Codes, consists of:\n1) A lightweight decoder for decoding and correcting trivial common-case\nerrors, designed for the cryogenic domain. The decoder is implemented for SFQ\nlogic.\n2) A statistical confidence-based technique for off-chip decoding bandwidth\nallocation, to efficiently handle rare complex decodes which are not covered by\nthe on-chip decoder.\n3) A method for stalling circuit execution, for the worst-case scenarios in\nwhich the provisioned off-chip bandwidth is insufficient to complete all\nrequested off-chip decodes.\nIn all, our proposal enables 70-99+% off-chip bandwidth elimination across a\nrange of logical and physical error rates, without significantly sacrificing\nthe accuracy of state-of-the-art off-chip decoding. By doing so, it achieves\n10-10000x bandwidth reduction over prior off-chip bandwidth reduction\ntechniques.

Subsequently, there has been widespread interest in\nextending the success of CNNs to data sets with non-Euclidean structure, such\nas graphs and manifolds, leading to the emerging field of geometric deep\nlearning. In order to improve our understanding of the architectures used in\nthis new field, several papers have proposed generalizations of the scattering\ntransform for non-Euclidean data structures such as undirected graphs and\ncompact Riemannian manifolds without boundary.\nIn this paper, we introduce a general, unified model for geometric scattering\non measure spaces.

We propose a new\ncriterion that identifies to which groups a useful representation should be\ninvariant and show that this criterion is sufficient to guarantee that the\nscattering transform has desirable stability and invariance properties.\nAdditionally, we consider finite measure spaces that are obtained from randomly\nsampling an unknown manifold. We propose two methods for constructing a\ndata-driven graph on which the associated graph scattering transform\napproximates the scattering transform on the underlying manifold.

    "abstract": "Phase retrieval (PR), a long-established challenge for recovering a\ncomplex-valued signal from its Fourier intensity-only measurements, has\nattracted considerable attention due to its widespread applications in digital\nimaging. Recently, deep learning-based approaches were developed that achieved\nsome success in single-shot PR. These approaches require a single Fourier\nintensity measurement without the need to impose any additional constraints on\nthe measured data. Nevertheless, vanilla deep neural networks (DNN) do not give\ngood performance due to the substantial disparity between the input and output\ndomains of the PR problems. Physics-informed approaches try to incorporate the\nFourier intensity measurements into an iterative approach to increase the\nreconstruction accuracy. It, however, requires a lengthy computation process,\nand the accuracy still cannot be guaranteed. Besides, many of these approaches\nwork on simulation data that ignore some common problems such as saturation and\nquantization errors in practical optical PR systems. In this paper, a novel\nphysics-driven multi-scale DNN structure dubbed PPRNet is proposed. Similar to\nother deep learning-based PR methods, PPRNet requires only a single Fourier\nintensity measurement. It is physics-driven that the network is guided to\nfollow the Fourier intensity measurement at different scales to enhance the\nreconstruction accuracy. PPRNet has a feedforward structure and can be\nend-to-end trained. Thus, it is much faster and more accurate than the\ntraditional physics-driven PR approaches. Extensive simulations and experiments\non a practical optical platform were conducted.

This can arise, for example, when the physical system\nis either under malicious attack (e.g., hacker attacks on power grids and\ninternet networks) or subject to extreme external conditions (e.g., weather\nconditions impacting electricity grids or large market movements impacting\nvaluations of derivative contracts). For that purpose, we employ Physics\nInformed Neural Networks (PINNs) -- universal approximators that can\nincorporate prior information from any physical law described by a system of\nPDEs. This prior knowledge acts in the training of the neural network as a\nregularization that limits the space of admissible solutions and increases the\ncorrectness of the function approximation. We show that when the true data\ngenerating process exhibits changepoints in the PDE dynamics, this\nregularization can lead to a complete miss-calibration and a failure of the\nmodel. Therefore, we propose an extension of PINNs using a Total-Variation\npenalty which accommodates (multiple) changepoints in the PDE dynamics. These\nchangepoints can occur at random locations over time, and they are estimated\ntogether with the solutions. We propose an additional refinement algorithm that\ncombines changepoints detection with a reduced dynamic programming method that\nis feasible for the computationally intensive PINNs methods, and we demonstrate\nthe benefits of the proposed model empirically using examples of different\nequations with changes in the parameters. In case of no changepoints in the\ndata, the proposed model reduces to the original PINNs model. In the presence\nof changepoints, it leads to improvements in parameter estimation, better model\nfitting, and a lower training error compared to the original PINNs model.",

    "abstract": "We are interested in finding combinatorial conditions for embedding graphs\ninto torus and using them in the embedding check algorithm. It is a well-known\nfact that any connected graph can be reduced to a one-vertex graph with loops\nand is homotopy equivalent to such a graph. If a connected graph has\nintersection of some edges, then some loops of one-vertex graph will also\nintersect. Therefore the problem of embedding graphs into some surface is\nequivalent to the question of embedding one-vertex graph in given surface. This\npaper considers a graph with rotations called hieroglyph. The equivalence of\nfour conditions is proved: (1) embedding hieroglyph into torus; (2) the absence\nof forbidden subgraphs in a hieroglyph; (3) some condition for the graph of\nloops; (4) the existence of a reduction of hieroglyph to one of the list of\nhieroglyphs. We also prove the existence of an algorithm with complexity $O(n)$\nthat recognizes embedding hieroglyph into torus.",

    "abstract": "A basic premise in graph signal processing (GSP) is that a graph encoding\npairwise (anti-)correlations of the targeted signal as edge weights is\nexploited for graph filtering. However, existing fast graph sampling schemes\nare designed and tested only for positive graphs describing positive\ncorrelations. In this paper, we show that for datasets with strong inherent\nanti-correlations, a suitable graph contains both positive and negative edge\nweights. In response, we propose a linear-time signed graph sampling method\ncentered on the concept of balanced signed graphs. Specifically, given an\nempirical covariance data matrix $\\bar{\\bf{C}}$, we first learn a sparse\ninverse matrix (graph Laplacian) $\\mathcal{L}$ corresponding to a signed graph\n$\\mathcal{G}$. We define the eigenvectors of Laplacian $\\mathcal{L}_B$ for a\nbalanced signed graph $\\mathcal{G}_B$ -- approximating $\\mathcal{G}$ via edge\nweight augmentation -- as graph frequency components. Next, we choose samples\nto minimize the low-pass filter reconstruction error in two steps. We first\nalign all Gershgorin disc left-ends of Laplacian $\\mathcal{L}_B$ at smallest\neigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathcal{L}_B)$ via similarity transform\n$\\mathcal{L}_p = \\S \\mathcal{L}_B \\S^{-1}$, leveraging a recent linear algebra\ntheorem called Gershgorin disc perfect alignment (GDPA). We then perform\nsampling on $\\mathcal{L}_p$ using a previous fast Gershgorin disc alignment\nsampling (GDAS) scheme. Experimental results show that our signed graph\nsampling method outperformed existing fast sampling schemes noticeably on\nvarious datasets.",

The first condition may affect children's\nspeech due to high arousal; the latter introduces linguistic, cognitive, and\ncommunicative demands on speakers. We collected physiological parameters data\nfrom 70 children in the two target conditions. First, we adopt a novel\nmodality-wise multiple-instance-learning (MI-MIL) approach to classify CWS vs.\nCWNS in different conditions effectively. The evaluation of this classifier\naddresses four critical research questions that align with state-of-the-art\nspeech science studies' interests. Later, we leverage SHAP classifier\ninterpretations to visualize the salient, fine-grain, and temporal\nphysiological parameters unique to CWS at the population/group-level and\npersonalized-level. While group-level identification of distinct patterns would\nenhance our understanding of stuttering etiology and development, the\npersonalized-level identification would enable remote, continuous, and\nreal-time assessment of stuttering children's physiological arousal, which may\nlead to personalized, just-in-time interventions, resulting in an improvement\nin speech fluency.

Classically, EEG-based BCI algorithms have relied on\nmodels such as support vector machines and linear discriminant analysis or\nmulticlass common spatial patterns. During the last decade, however, more\nsophisticated machine learning architectures, such as convolutional neural\nnetworks, recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks and gated\nrecurrent unit networks, have been extensively used to enhance discriminability\nin multiclass BCI tasks. Additionally, preprocessing and denoising of EEG\nsignals has always been key in the successful decoding of brain activity, and\nthe determination of an optimal and standardized EEG preprocessing activity is\nan active area of research. In this paper, we present a deep neural network\narchitecture specifically engineered to a) provide state-of-the-art performance\nin multiclass motor imagery classification and b) remain robust to\npreprocessing to enable real-time processing of raw data as it streams from EEG\nand BCI equipment. It is based on the intertwined use of time-distributed fully\nconnected (tdFC) and space-distributed 1D temporal convolutional layers\n(sdConv) and explicitly addresses the possibility that interaction of spatial\nand temporal features of the EEG signal occurs at all levels of complexity.\nNumerical experiments demonstrate that our architecture provides superior\nperformance compared baselines based on a combination of 3D convolutions and\nrecurrent neural networks in a six-class motor imagery network, with a\nsubjectwise accuracy that reaches 99%.

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment(MCI) is a precursor of Alzheimer's disease(AD), and\nthe detection of MCI is of great clinical significance. Analyzing the\nstructural brain networks of patients is vital for the recognition of MCI.\nHowever, the current studies on structural brain networks are totally dependent\non specific toolboxes, which is time-consuming and subjective. Few tools can\nobtain the structural brain networks from brain diffusion tensor images. In\nthis work, an adversarial learning-based structural brain-network generative\nmodel(SBGM) is proposed to directly learn the structural connections from brain\ndiffusion tensor images. By analyzing the differences in structural brain\nnetworks across subjects, we found that the structural brain networks of\nsubjects showed a consistent trend from elderly normal controls(NC) to early\nmild cognitive impairment(EMCI) to late mild cognitive impairment(LMCI):\nstructural connectivity progressed in a progressively weaker direction as the\ncondition worsened. In addition, our proposed model tri-classifies EMCI, LMCI,\nand NC subjects, achieving a classification accuracy of 83.33\\% on the\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative(ADNI) database.",

    "abstract": "Brain biometrics based on electroencephalography (EEG) have been used\nincreasingly for personal identification. Traditional machine learning\ntechniques as well as modern day deep learning methods have been applied with\npromising results. In this paper we present EEG-BBNet, a hybrid network which\nintegrates convolutional neural networks (CNN) with graph convolutional neural\nnetworks (GCNN). The benefit of the CNN in automatic feature extraction and the\ncapability of GCNN in learning connectivity between EEG electrodes through\ngraph representation are jointly exploited. We examine various connectivity\nmeasures, namely the Euclidean distance, Pearson's correlation coefficient,\nphase-locked value, phase-lag index, and Rho index. The performance of the\nproposed method is assessed on a benchmark dataset consisting of various\nbrain-computer interface (BCI) tasks and compared to other state-of-the-art\napproaches. We found that our models outperform all baselines in the\nevent-related potential (ERP) task with an average correct recognition rates up\nto 99.26% using intra-session data. EEG-BBNet with Pearson's correlation and\nRHO index provide the best classification results. In addition, our model\ndemonstrates greater adaptability using inter-session and inter-task data. We\nalso investigate the practicality of our proposed model with smaller number of\nelectrodes. Electrode placements over the frontal lobe region appears to be\nmost appropriate with minimal lost in performance.",

We reduce the\nsufficient sample complexity in a novel task with the information that is\nlearned from auxiliary tasks. We assume each task to be a different random\nPrincipal Component (PC) matrix with a possibly different support and that the\nsupport union of the PC matrices is small. We then pool the data from all the\ntasks to execute an improper estimation of a single PC matrix by maximising the\n$l_1$-regularised predictive covariance to establish that with high probability\nthe true support union can be recovered provided a sufficient number of tasks\n$m$ and a sufficient number of samples $ O\\left(\\frac{\\log(p)}{m}\\right)$ for\neach task, for $p$-dimensional vectors. Then, for a novel task, we prove that\nthe maximisation of the $l_1$-regularised predictive covariance with the\nadditional constraint that the support is a subset of the estimated support\nunion could reduce the sufficient sample complexity of successful support\nrecovery to $O(\\log |J|)$, where $J$ is the support union recovered from the\nauxiliary tasks. Typically, $|J|$ would be much less than $p$ for sparse\nmatrices. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of our experiments through\nnumerical simulations.",

    "title": "DeepClouds.ai: Deep learning enabled computationally cheap direct  numerical simulations",
    "abstract": "Simulation of turbulent flows, especially at the edges of clouds in the\natmosphere, is an inherently challenging task. Hitherto, the best possible\ncomputational method to perform such experiments is the Direct Numerical\nSimulation (DNS). DNS involves solving non-linear partial differential\nequations for fluid flows, also known as Navier-Stokes equations, on\ndiscretized grid boxes in a three-dimensional space. It is a valuable paradigm\nthat has guided the numerical weather prediction models to compute rainfall\nformation. However, DNS cannot be performed for large domains of practical\nutility to the weather forecast community. Here, we introduce DeepClouds.ai, a\n3D-UNET that simulates the outputs of a rising cloud DNS experiment. The\nproblem of increasing the domain size in DNS is addressed by mapping an inner\n3D cube to the complete 3D cube from the output of the DNS discretized grid\nsimulation. Our approach effectively captures turbulent flow dynamics without\nhaving to solve the complex dynamical core. The baseline shows that the deep\nlearning-based simulation is comparable to the partial-differential\nequation-based model as measured by various score metrics. This framework can\nbe used to further the science of turbulence and cloud flows by enabling\nsimulations over large physical domains in the atmosphere. It would lead to\ncascading societal benefits by improved weather predictions via advanced\nparameterization schemes.",
