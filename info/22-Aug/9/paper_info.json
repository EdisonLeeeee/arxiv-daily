    "title": "A Case for Dataset Specific Profiling",
    "abstract": "Data-driven science is an emerging paradigm where scientific discoveries\ndepend on the execution of computational AI models against rich,\ndiscipline-specific datasets. With modern machine learning frameworks, anyone\ncan develop and execute computational models that reveal concepts hidden in the\ndata that could enable scientific applications. For important and widely used\ndatasets, computing the performance of every computational model that can run\nagainst a dataset is cost prohibitive in terms of cloud resources. Benchmarking\napproaches used in practice use representative datasets to infer performance\nwithout actually executing models. While practicable, these approaches limit\nextensive dataset profiling to a few datasets and introduce bias that favors\nmodels suited for representative datasets. As a result, each dataset's unique\ncharacteristics are left unexplored and subpar models are selected based on\ninference from generalized datasets. This necessitates a new paradigm that\nintroduces dataset profiling into the model selection process. To demonstrate\nthe need for dataset-specific profiling, we answer two questions:(1) Can\nscientific datasets significantly permute the rank order of computational\nmodels compared to widely used representative datasets? (2) If so, could\nlightweight model execution improve benchmarking accuracy? Taken together, the\nanswers to these questions lay the foundation for a new dataset-aware\nbenchmarking paradigm.",

While this hybrid framework has been demonstrated to deliver better\nanswer and explanation selection than transformer-based and existing ILP\nsolvers, the neuro-symbolic integration still relies on a convex relaxation of\nthe ILP formulation, which can produce sub-optimal solutions. To improve these\nlimitations, we propose Diff-Comb Explainer, a novel neuro-symbolic\narchitecture based on Differentiable BlackBox Combinatorial solvers (DBCS)\n(Pogan\\v{c}i\\'c et al., 2019).

    "abstract": "In recent years, the dominant paradigm for text spotting is to combine the\ntasks of text detection and recognition into a single end-to-end framework.\nUnder this paradigm, both tasks are accomplished by operating over a shared\nglobal feature map extracted from the input image. Among the main challenges\nthat end-to-end approaches face is the performance degradation when recognizing\ntext across scale variations (smaller or larger text), and arbitrary word\nrotation angles. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a novel\nglobal-to-local attention mechanism for text spotting, termed GLASS, that fuses\ntogether global and local features. The global features are extracted from the\nshared backbone, preserving contextual information from the entire image, while\nthe local features are computed individually on resized, high-resolution\nrotated word crops. The information extracted from the local crops alleviates\nmuch of the inherent difficulties with scale and word rotation. We show a\nperformance analysis across scales and angles, highlighting improvement over\nscale and angle extremities. In addition, we introduce an orientation-aware\nloss term supervising the detection task, and show its contribution to both\ndetection and recognition performance across all angles. Finally, we show that\nGLASS is general by incorporating it into other leading text spotting\narchitectures, improving their text spotting performance.

At the stage of place recognition, the initial position of the vehicle\nin the map is determined by comparing the visual sensor output with a set of\ngeo-tagged map regions of interest. Subsequently, at the stage of map metric\nlocalization, the vehicle is tracked while it moves across the map by\ncontinuously aligning the visual sensors' output with the current area of the\nmap that is being traversed. In this paper, we survey, discuss and compare the\nlatest methods for LiDAR based, camera based and cross-modal visual map\nlocalization for both stages, in an effort to highlight the strength and\nweakness of each approach.",

    "abstract": "Surrogate models can reduce computational costs for multivariable functions\nwith an unknown internal structure (black boxes). In a discrete formulation,\nsurrogate modeling is equivalent to restoring a multidimensional array (tensor)\nfrom a small part of its elements. The alternating least squares (ALS)\nalgorithm in the tensor train (TT) format is a widely used approach to\neffectively solve this problem in the case of non-adaptive tensor recovery from\na given training set (i.e., tensor completion problem). TT-ALS allows obtaining\na low-parametric representation of the tensor, which is free from the curse of\ndimensionality and can be used for fast computation of the values at arbitrary\ntensor indices or efficient implementation of algebra operations with the black\nbox (integration, etc.). However, to obtain high accuracy in the presence of\nrestrictions on the size of the train data, a good choice of initial\napproximation is essential. In this work, we construct the ANOVA representation\nin the TT-format and use it as an initial approximation for the TT-ALS\nalgorithm. The performed numerical computations for a number of\nmultidimensional model problems, including the parametric partial differential\nequation, demonstrate a significant advantage of our approach for the commonly\nused random initial approximation. For all considered model problems we\nobtained an increase in accuracy by at least an order of magnitude with the\nsame number of requests to the black box. The proposed approach is very general\nand can be applied in a wide class of real-world surrogate modeling and machine\nlearning problems.",

    "abstract": "Deep image inpainting has made impressive progress with recent advances in\nimage generation and processing algorithms. We claim that the performance of\ninpainting algorithms can be better judged by the generated structures and\ntextures. Structures refer to the generated object boundary or novel geometric\nstructures within the hole, while texture refers to high-frequency details,\nespecially man-made repeating patterns filled inside the structural regions. We\nbelieve that better structures are usually obtained from a coarse-to-fine\nGAN-based generator network while repeating patterns nowadays can be better\nmodeled using state-of-the-art high-frequency fast fourier convolutional\nlayers. In this paper, we propose a novel inpainting network combining the\nadvantages of the two designs. Therefore, our model achieves a remarkable\nvisual quality to match state-of-the-art performance in both structure\ngeneration and repeating texture synthesis using a single network. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, and our conclusions\nfurther highlight the two critical factors of image inpainting quality,\nstructures, and textures, as the future design directions of inpainting\nnetworks.",

However,\ncomputational trust dynamic models describing the interactive relationship\nbetween the AVs and surrounding human drivers in traffic rarely exist. This\npaper aims to fill this gap by developing a quantitative trust dynamic model of\nthe human driver in the car-following interaction with the AV and incorporating\nthe proposed trust dynamic model into the AV's control design. The human\ndriver's trust level is modeled as a plan evaluation metric that measures the\nexplicability of the AV's plan from the human driver's perspective, and the\nexplicability score of the AV's plan is integrated into the AV's\ndecision-making process. With the proposed approach, trust-aware AVs generate\nexplicable plans by optimizing both predefined plans and explicability of the\nplans in the car-following interactions with the following human driver. The\nresults collectively demonstrate that the trust-aware AV can generate more\nexplicable plans and achieve a higher trust level for the human driver compared\nto trust-unaware AV in human-AV interactions.",

This has attracted a great\ndeal of attention from academia to industry in recent years. This has\nundoubtedly improved the quality of healthcare delivery. However, these\nAI-based medical applications still have poor adoption due to their\ndifficulties in satisfying strict security, privacy, and quality of service\nstandards (such as low latency). Moreover, medical data are usually fragmented\nand private, making it challenging to generate robust results across\npopulations. Recent developments in federated learning (FL) have made it\npossible to train complex machine-learned models in a distributed manner. Thus,\nFL has become an active research domain, particularly processing the medical\ndata at the edge of the network in a decentralized way to preserve privacy and\nsecurity concerns. To this end, this survey paper highlights the current and\nfuture of FL technology in medical applications where data sharing is a\nsignificant burden. It also review and discuss the current research trends and\ntheir outcomes for designing reliable and scalable FL models. We outline the\ngeneral FL's statistical problems, device challenges, security, privacy\nconcerns, and its potential in the medical domain. Moreover, our study is also\nfocused on medical applications where we highlight the burden of global cancer\nand the efficient use of FL for the development of computer-aided diagnosis\ntools for addressing them.

In particular,\ndeep convolutional neural networks (D-CNNs) have been key players and were\nadopted by the medical imaging community to assist clinicians and medical\nexperts in disease diagnosis. However, training deep neural networks such as\nD-CNN on high-resolution 3D volumes of Computed Tomography (CT) scans for\ndiagnostic tasks poses formidable computational challenges. This raises the\nneed of developing deep learning-based approaches that are robust in learning\nrepresentations in 2D images, instead 3D scans. In this paper, we propose a new\nstrategy to train \\emph{slice-level} classifiers on CT scans based on the\ndescriptors of the adjacent slices along the axis. In particular, each of which\nis extracted through a convolutional neural network (CNN). This method is\napplicable to CT datasets with per-slice labels such as the RSNA Intracranial\nHemorrhage (ICH) dataset, which aims to predict the presence of ICH and\nclassify it into 5 different sub-types. We obtain a single model in the top 4\\%\nbest-performing solutions of the RSNA ICH challenge, where model ensembles are\nallowed. Experiments also show that the proposed method significantly\noutperforms the baseline model on CQ500.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a critical role in identifying\nSA since it might reveal abnormal cardiac activity. Recent research on\nECG-based SA detection has focused on feature engineering techniques that\nextract specific characteristics from multiple-lead ECG signals and use them as\nclassification model inputs. In this study, a novel method of feature\nextraction based on the detection of S peaks is proposed to enhance the\ndetection of adjacent SA segments using a single-lead ECG. In particular, ECG\nfeatures collected from a single lead (V2) are used to identify SA episodes. On\nthe extracted features, a CNN model is trained to detect SA. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method detects SA from single-lead ECG\ndata is more accurate than existing state-of-the-art methods, with 91.13%\nclassification accuracy, 92.58% sensitivity, and 88.75% specificity.

Short-term\ntraffic prediction is an important tool for operation in traffic management and\ntransportation system. The short-term traffic flow value results can be used\nfor travel time estimation by route guidance and advanced traveler information\nsystems. Though the KFT has been tested for homogeneous traffic, its efficiency\nin heterogeneous traffic has yet to be investigated. The research was conducted\non Mirpur Road in Dhaka, near the Sobhanbagh Mosque. The stream contains a\nheterogeneous mix of traffic, which implies uncertainty in prediction. The\npropositioned method is executed in Python using the pykalman library. The\nlibrary is mostly used in advanced database modeling in the KFT framework,\nwhich addresses uncertainty. The data was derived from a three-hour traffic\ncount of the vehicle. According to the Geometric Design Standards Manual\npublished by Roads and Highways Division (RHD), Bangladesh in 2005, the\nheterogeneous traffic flow value was translated into an equivalent passenger\ncar unit (PCU). The PCU obtained from five-minute aggregation was then utilized\nas the suggested model's dataset. The propositioned model has a mean absolute\npercent error (MAPE) of 14.62, indicating that the KFT model can forecast\nreasonably well. The root mean square percent error (RMSPE) shows an 18.73%\naccuracy which is less than 25%; hence the model is acceptable. The developed\nmodel has an R2 value of 0.879, indicating that it can explain 87.9 percent of\nthe variability in the dataset.

    "abstract": "Through assembling the navigation parameters as matrix Lie group state, the\ncorresponding inertial navigation system (INS) kinematic model possesses a\ngroup-affine property. The Lie logarithm of the navigation state estimation\nerror satisfies a log-linear autonomous differential equation. These log-linear\nmodels are still applicable even with arbitrarily large initial errors, which\nis very attractive for INS initial alignment. However, in existing works, the\nlog-linear models are all derived based on first-order linearization\napproximation, which seemingly goes against their successful applications in\nINS initial alignment with large misalignments. In this work, it is shown that\nthe log-linear models can also be derived without any approximation, the error\ndynamics for both left and right invariant error in continuous time are given\nin matrix Lie group SE_2 (3) for the first time. This work provides another\nevidence for the validity of the log-linear model in situations with\narbitrarily large initial errors.",

    "abstract": "The axes ordering in PCP presents a particular story from the data based on\nthe user perception of PCP polylines. Existing works focus on directly\noptimizing for PCP axes ordering based on some common analysis tasks like\nclustering, neighborhood, and correlation. However, direct optimization for PCP\naxes based on these common properties is restrictive because it does not\naccount for multiple properties occurring between the axes, and for local\nproperties that occur in small regions in the data. Also, many of these\ntechniques do not support the human-in-the-loop (HIL) paradigm, which is\ncrucial (i) for explainability and (ii) in cases where no single reordering\nscheme fits the user goals. To alleviate these problems, we present PC-Expo, a\nreal-time visual analytics framework for all-in-one PCP line pattern detection,\nand axes reordering. We studied the connection of line patterns in PCPs with\ndifferent data analysis tasks and datasets. PC-Expo expands prior work on PCP\naxes reordering by developing real-time, local detection schemes for the 12\nmost common analysis tasks (properties). Users can choose the story they want\nto present with PCPs by optimizing directly over their choice of properties.\nThese properties can be ranked, or combined using individual weights, creating\na custom optimization scheme for axes reordering. Users can control the\ngranularity at which they want to work with their detection scheme in the data,\nallowing exploration of local regions. PC-Expo also supports HIL axes\nreordering via local-property visualization, which shows the regions of\ngranular activity for every axis pair. Local-property visualization is helpful\nfor PCP axes reordering based on multiple properties, when no single reordering\nscheme fits the user goals.",

    "abstract": "Video 3D human pose estimation aims to localize the 3D coordinates of human\njoints from videos. Recent transformer-based approaches focus on capturing the\nspatiotemporal information from sequential 2D poses, which cannot model the\ncontextual depth feature effectively since the visual depth features are lost\nin the step of 2D pose estimation. In this paper, we simplify the paradigm into\nan end-to-end framework, Instance-guided Video Transformer (IVT), which enables\nlearning spatiotemporal contextual depth information from visual features\neffectively and predicts 3D poses directly from video frames. In particular, we\nfirstly formulate video frames as a series of instance-guided tokens and each\ntoken is in charge of predicting the 3D pose of a human instance. These tokens\ncontain body structure information since they are extracted by the guidance of\njoint offsets from the human center to the corresponding body joints. Then,\nthese tokens are sent into IVT for learning spatiotemporal contextual depth. In\naddition, we propose a cross-scale instance-guided attention mechanism to\nhandle the variational scales among multiple persons. Finally, the 3D poses of\neach person are decoded from instance-guided tokens by coordinate regression.\nExperiments on three widely-used 3D pose estimation benchmarks show that the\nproposed IVT achieves state-of-the-art performances.",

Recently there have been some\nrapid strides in the development of image segmentation models using deep\nlearning. However, most of the advancements have been made in model\narchitecture design. In solving any supervised deep learning problem related to\nsegmentation, the success of the model that one builds depends upon the amount\nand quality of input training data we use for that model. This data should\ncontain well-annotated varied images for better working of the segmentation\nmodel. Issues like this pertaining to annotations in a dataset can lead the\nmodel to conclude with overwhelming Type I and II errors in testing and\nvalidation, causing malicious issues when trying to tackle real world problems.\nTo address this problem and to make our model more accurate, dynamic, and\nrobust, data augmentation comes into usage as it helps in expanding our sample\ntraining data and making it better and more diversified overall. Hence, in our\nstudy, we focus on investigating the benefits of data augmentation by analyzing\npre-existing image datasets and performing augmentations accordingly. Our\nresults show that the performance and robustness of existing state of the art\n(or SOTA) models can be increased dramatically without any increase in model\ncomplexity or inference time.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce a novel AFE-CNN, which devotes to enhance the\nfeatures of 3D skeleton-based actions to adapt to challenging actions. We\npropose feature enhance modules from key joint, bone vector, key frame and\ntemporal perspectives, thus the AFE-CNN is more robust to camera views and body\nsizes variation, and significantly improve the recognition accuracy on\nchallenging actions. Moreover, our AFE-CNN adopts a light-weight CNN model to\ndecode images with action feature enhanced, which ensures a much lower\ncomputational burden than the state-of-the-art methods.

Recently, many efforts have\nbeen devoted to improving Tag-aware recommendation systems (TRS) with Graph\nConvolutional Networks (GCN), which has become new state-of-the-art for the\ngeneral recommendation. However, some solutions are directly inherited from GCN\nwithout justifications, which is difficult to alleviate the sparsity,\nambiguity, and redundancy issues introduced by tags, thus adding to\ndifficulties of training and degrading recommendation performance.\nIn this work, we aim to simplify the design of GCN to make it more concise\nfor TRS. We propose a novel tag-aware recommendation model named Light\nFolksonomy Graph Collaborative Filtering (LFGCF), which only includes the\nessential GCN components. Specifically, LFGCF first constructs Folksonomy\nGraphs from the records of user assigning tags and item getting tagged. Then we\nleverage the simple design of aggregation to learn the high-order\nrepresentations on Folksonomy Graphs and use the weighted sum of the embeddings\nlearned at several layers for information updating. We share tags embeddings to\nbridge the information gap between users and items. Besides, a regularization\nfunction named TransRT is proposed to better depict user preferences and item\nfeatures.

    "abstract": "Network slicing is a critical driver for guaranteeing the diverse service\nlevel agreements (SLA) in 5G and future networks. Inter-slice radio resource\nallocation (IS-RRA) in the radio access network (RAN) is very important.\nHowever, user mobility brings new challenges for optimal IS-RRA. This paper\nfirst proposes a soft and hard hybrid slicing framework where a common slice is\nintroduced to realize a trade-off between isolation and spectrum efficiency\n(SE). To address the challenges posed by user mobility, we propose a two-step\ndeep learning-based algorithm: joint long short-term memory (LSTM)-based\nnetwork state prediction and deep Q network (DQN)-based slicing strategy. In\nthe proposal, LSTM networks are employed to predict traffic demand and the\nlocation of each user in a slicing window level. Moreover, channel gain is\nmapped by location and a radio map. Then, the predicted channel gain and\ntraffic demand are input to the DQN to output the precise slicing adjustment.\nFinally, experiment results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed slicing\nframework: the slices' SLA can be guaranteed well, and the proposed algorithm\ncan achieve near-optimal performance in terms of the SLA satisfaction ratio,\nisolation degree and SE.",

    "abstract": "Rapidly evolving technology, data and analytic landscapes are permeating many\nfields and professions. In public health, the need for data science skills\nincluding data literacy is particularly prominent given both the potential of\nnovel data types and analysis methods to fill gaps in existing public health\nresearch and intervention practices, as well as the potential of such data or\nmethods to perpetuate or augment health disparities. Through a review of public\nhealth courses and programs at the top 10 U.S. and globally ranked schools of\npublic health, this article summarizes existing educational efforts in public\nhealth data science. These existing practices serve to inform efforts for\nbroadening such curricula to further schools and populations. Data science\nethics course offerings are also examined in context of assessing how\npopulation health principles can be blended into training across levels of data\ninvolvement to augment the traditional core of public health curricula.\nParallel findings from domestic and international 'outside the classroom'\ntraining programs are also synthesized to advance approaches for increasing\ndiversity in public health data science. Based on these program reviews and\ntheir synthesis, a four-point formula is distilled for furthering public health\ndata science education efforts, toward development of a critical and inclusive\nmass of practitioners with fluency to leverage data to advance goals of public\nhealth and improve quality of life in the digital age.",

    "abstract": "Out-Of-Distribution generalization (OOD) is all about learning invariance\nagainst environmental changes. If the context in every class is evenly\ndistributed, OOD would be trivial because the context can be easily removed due\nto an underlying principle: class is invariant to context. However, collecting\nsuch a balanced dataset is impractical. Learning on imbalanced data makes the\nmodel bias to context and thus hurts OOD. Therefore, the key to OOD is context\nbalance. We argue that the widely adopted assumption in prior work, the context\nbias can be directly annotated or estimated from biased class prediction,\nrenders the context incomplete or even incorrect. In contrast, we point out the\neveroverlooked other side of the above principle: context is also invariant to\nclass, which motivates us to consider the classes (which are already labeled)\nas the varying environments to resolve context bias (without context labels).\nWe implement this idea by minimizing the contrastive loss of intra-class sample\nsimilarity while assuring this similarity to be invariant across all classes.\nOn benchmarks with various context biases and domain gaps, we show that a\nsimple re-weighting based classifier equipped with our context estimation\nachieves state-of-the-art performance.

We compare the spectral expansion properties of our algorithm\nwith that of an existing curvature-based non-local rewiring strategy.

However, conventional visual recognition models\nusually miss objects because of the significant occlusion among instances and\ncauses incorrect prediction due to the visual ambiguity with the high object\ncrowdedness. In this paper, we propose an interactive exploration framework\ncalled Smart Explorer for recognizing all objects in dense clutters. Our Smart\nExplorer physically interacts with the clutter to maximize the recognition\nperformance while minimize the number of motions, where the false positives and\nnegatives can be alleviated effectively with the optimal accuracy-efficiency\ntrade-offs. Specifically, we first collect the multi-view RGB-D images of the\nclutter and reconstruct the corresponding point cloud. By aggregating the\ninstance segmentation of RGB images across views, we acquire the instance-wise\npoint cloud partition of the clutter through which the existed classes and the\nnumber of objects for each class are predicted. The pushing actions for\neffective physical interaction are generated to sizably reduce the recognition\nuncertainty that consists of the instance segmentation entropy and multi-view\nobject disagreement. Therefore, the optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off of\nobject recognition in dense clutter is achieved via iterative instance\nprediction and physical interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nSmart Explorer acquires promising recognition accuracy with only a few actions,\nwhich also outperforms the random pushing by a large margin.",

    "title": "\"All of them claim to be the best\": Multi-perspective study of VPN users  and VPN providers",
    "abstract": "As more users adopt VPNs for a variety of reasons, it is important to develop\nempirical knowledge of their needs and mental models of what a VPN offers.\nMoreover, studying VPN users alone is not enough because, in using a VPN, a\nuser essentially transfers trust, say from their network provider, onto the VPN\nprovider. To that end, we are the first to study the VPN ecosystem from both\nthe users' and the providers' perspectives. In this paper, we conduct a\nquantitative survey of 1,252 VPN users in the U.S. and qualitative interviews\nof nine providers to answer several research questions regarding the\nmotivations, needs, threat model, and mental model of users and the key\nchallenges and insights from VPN providers. We create novel insights by\naugmenting our multi-perspective results, and highlight cases where the user\nand provider perspectives are misaligned. Alarmingly, we find that users rely\non and trust VPN review sites, but VPN providers shed light on how they are\nmostly motivated by money. Worryingly, we find that users have flawed mental\nmodels about the protection VPNs provide, and about the data collected by VPNs.\nWe present actionable recommendations for technologists and security and\nprivacy advocates by identifying potential areas to focus efforts and improve\nthe VPN ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Face based affective computing consists in detecting emotions from face\nimages. It is useful to unlock better automatic comprehension of human\nbehaviours and could pave the way toward improved human-machines interactions.\nHowever it comes with the challenging task of designing a computational\nrepresentation of emotions. So far, emotions have been represented either\ncontinuously in the 2D Valence/Arousal space or in a discrete manner with\nEkman's 7 basic emotions. Alternatively, Ekman's Facial Action Unit (AU) system\nhave also been used to caracterize emotions using a codebook of unitary\nmuscular activations. ABAW3 and ABAW4 Multi-Task Challenges are the first work\nto provide a large scale database annotated with those three types of labels.\nIn this paper we present a transformer based multi-task method for jointly\nlearning to predict valence arousal, action units and basic emotions. From an\narchitectural standpoint our method uses a taskwise token approach to\nefficiently model the similarities between the tasks. From a learning point of\nview we use an uncertainty weighted loss for modelling the difference of\nstochasticity between the three tasks annotations.",

Many methods rely on the approximation\nof a value function to derive near-optimal policies. In partially observable\nenvironments, these functions depend on the complete sequence of observations\nand past actions, called the history. In this work, we show empirically that\nrecurrent neural networks trained to approximate such value functions\ninternally filter the posterior probability distribution of the current state\ngiven the history, called the belief. More precisely, we show that, as a\nrecurrent neural network learns the Q-function, its hidden states become more\nand more correlated with the beliefs of state variables that are relevant to\noptimal control. This correlation is measured through their mutual information.\nIn addition, we show that the expected return of an agent increases with the\nability of its recurrent architecture to reach a high mutual information\nbetween its hidden states and the beliefs. Finally, we show that the mutual\ninformation between the hidden states and the beliefs of variables that are\nirrelevant for optimal control decreases through the learning process.

    "abstract": "Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a powerful approach to classify whole\nslide images (WSIs) for diagnostic pathology. A fundamental challenge of MIL on\nWSI classification is to discover the \\textit{critical instances} that trigger\nthe bag label. However, previous methods are primarily designed under the\nindependent and identical distribution hypothesis (\\textit{i.i.d}), ignoring\neither the correlations between instances or heterogeneity of tumours. In this\npaper, we propose a novel multiplex-detection-based multiple instance learning\n(MDMIL) to tackle the issues above. Specifically, MDMIL is constructed by the\ninternal query generation module (IQGM) and the multiplex detection module\n(MDM) and assisted by the memory-based contrastive loss during training.\nFirstly, IQGM gives the probability of instances and generates the internal\nquery (IQ) for the subsequent MDM by aggregating highly reliable features after\nthe distribution analysis. Secondly, the multiplex-detection cross-attention\n(MDCA) and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) in MDM cooperate to generate the\nfinal representations for the WSI. In this process, the IQ and trainable\nvariational query (VQ) successfully build up the connections between instances\nand significantly improve the model's robustness toward heterogeneous tumours.\nAt last, to further enforce constraints in the feature space and stabilize the\ntraining process, we adopt a memory-based contrastive loss, which is\npracticable for WSI classification even with a single sample as input in each\niteration. We conduct experiments on three computational pathology datasets,\ne.g., CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC datasets. The superior accuracy and\nAUC demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MDMIL over other\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present MetaEmu, an architecture-agnostic emulator\nsynthesizer geared towards rehosting and security analysis of automotive\nfirmware. MetaEmu improves over existing rehosting environments in two ways:\nFirstly, it solves the hitherto open-problem of a lack of generic Virtual\nExecution Environments (VXEs) for rehosting by synthesizing processor\nsimulators from Ghidra's language definitions. In doing so, MetaEmu can\nsimulate any processor supported by a vast and growing library of open-source\ndefinitions. In MetaEmu, we use a specification-based approach to cover\nperipherals, execution models, and analyses, which allows our framework to be\neasily extended. Secondly, MetaEmu can rehost and analyze multiple targets,\neach of different architecture, simultaneously, and share analysis facts\nbetween each target's analysis environment, a technique we call inter-device\nanalysis. We show that the flexibility afforded by our approach does not lead\nto a performance trade-off -- MetaEmu lifts rehosted firmware to an optimized\nintermediate representation, and provides performance comparable to existing\nemulation tools, such as Unicorn. Our evaluation spans five different\narchitectures, bare-metal and RTOS-based firmware, and three kinds of\nautomotive Electronic Control Unit (ECU) from four distinct vendors -- none of\nwhich can be rehosted or emulated by current tools, due to lack of processor\nsupport.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used to perform different machine\nlearning tasks on graphs. As the size of the graphs grows, and the GNNs get\ndeeper, training and inference time become costly in addition to the memory\nrequirement. Thus, without sacrificing accuracy, graph sparsification, or model\ncompression becomes a viable approach for graph learning tasks. A few existing\ntechniques only study the sparsification of graphs and GNN models. In this\npaper, we develop a SparseGCN pipeline to study all possible sparsification in\nGNN. We provide a theoretical analysis and empirically show that it can add up\nto 11.6\\% additional sparsity to the embedding matrix without sacrificing the\naccuracy of the commonly used benchmark graph datasets.",

    "abstract": "Loss of upper extremity motor control and function is an unremitting symptom\nin post-stroke patients. This would impose hardships on accomplishing their\ndaily life activities. Supernumerary robotic limbs (SRLs) were introduced as a\nsolution to regain the lost Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) by introducing an\nindependent new limb. The actuation systems in SRL can be categorized into\nrigid and soft actuators. Soft actuators have proven advantageous over their\nrigid counterparts through intrinsic safety, cost, and energy efficiency.\nHowever, they suffer from low stiffness, which jeopardizes their accuracy.\nVariable Stiffness Actuators (VSAs) are newly developed technologies that have\nbeen proven to ensure accuracy and safety. In this paper, we introduce the\nnovel Supernumerary Robotic Limb based on Variable Stiffness Actuators. Based\non our knowledge, the proposed proof-of-concept SRL is the first that utilizes\nVariable Stiffness Actuators. The developed SRL would assist post-stroke\npatients in bi-manual tasks, e.g., eating with a fork and knife. The modeling,\ndesign, and realization of the system are illustrated. The proposed SRL was\nevaluated and verified for its accuracy via predefined trajectories. The safety\nwas verified by utilizing the momentum observer for collision detection, and\nseveral post-collision reaction strategies were evaluated through the Soft\nTissue Injury Test. The assistance process is qualitatively verified through\nstandard user-satisfaction questionnaire.",

    "abstract": "There is strong interest in the generation of synthetic video imagery of\npeople talking for various purposes, including entertainment, communication,\ntraining, and advertisement. With the development of deep fake generation\nmodels, synthetic video imagery will soon be visually indistinguishable to the\nnaked eye from a naturally capture video. In addition, many methods are\ncontinuing to improve to avoid more careful, forensic visual analysis. Some\ndeep fake videos are produced through the use of facial puppetry, which\ndirectly controls the head and face of the synthetic image through the\nmovements of the actor, allow the actor to 'puppet' the image of another. In\nthis paper, we address the question of whether one person's movements can be\ndistinguished from the original speaker by controlling the visual appearance of\nthe speaker but transferring the behavior signals from another source. We\nconduct a study by comparing synthetic imagery that: 1) originates from a\ndifferent person speaking a different utterance, 2) originates from the same\nperson speaking a different utterance, and 3) originates from a different\nperson speaking the same utterance. Our study shows that synthetic videos in\nall three cases are seen as less real and less engaging than the original\nsource video. Our results indicate that there could be a behavioral signature\nthat is detectable from a person's movements that is separate from their visual\nappearance, and that this behavioral signature could be used to distinguish a\ndeep fake from a properly captured video.",

    "abstract": "Current deep learning solutions are well known for not informing whether they\ncan reliably classify an example during inference. One of the most effective\nways to build more reliable deep learning solutions is to improve their\nperformance in the so-called out-of-distribution detection task, which\nessentially consists of \"know that you do not know\" or \"know the unknown\". In\nother words, out-of-distribution detection capable systems may reject\nperforming a nonsense classification when submitted to instances of classes on\nwhich the neural network was not trained. This thesis tackles the defiant\nout-of-distribution detection task by proposing novel loss functions and\ndetection scores. Uncertainty estimation is also a crucial auxiliary task in\nbuilding more robust deep learning systems. Therefore, we also deal with this\nrobustness-related task, which evaluates how realistic the probabilities\npresented by the deep neural network are. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach, in addition to a substantial set of experiments, which includes\nstate-of-the-art results, we use arguments based on the principle of maximum\nentropy to establish the theoretical foundation of the proposed approaches.\nUnlike most current methods, our losses and scores are seamless and principled\nsolutions that produce accurate predictions in addition to fast and efficient\ninference. Moreover, our approaches can be incorporated into current and future\nprojects simply by replacing the loss used to train the deep neural network and\ncomputing a rapid score for detection.",

    "abstract": "Proof-of-learning (PoL) proposes a model owner use machine learning training\ncheckpoints to establish a proof of having expended the necessary compute for\ntraining. The authors of PoL forego cryptographic approaches and trade rigorous\nsecurity guarantees for scalability to deep learning by being applicable to\nstochastic gradient descent and adaptive variants. This lack of formal analysis\nleaves the possibility that an attacker may be able to spoof a proof for a\nmodel they did not train.\nWe contribute a formal analysis of why the PoL protocol cannot be formally\n(dis)proven to be robust against spoofing adversaries. To do so, we disentangle\nthe two roles of proof verification in PoL: (a) efficiently determining if a\nproof is a valid gradient descent trajectory, and (b) establishing precedence\nby making it more expensive to craft a proof after training completes (i.e.,\nspoofing). We show that efficient verification results in a tradeoff between\naccepting legitimate proofs and rejecting invalid proofs because deep learning\nnecessarily involves noise. Without a precise analytical model for how this\nnoise affects training, we cannot formally guarantee if a PoL verification\nalgorithm is robust. Then, we demonstrate that establishing precedence robustly\nalso reduces to an open problem in learning theory: spoofing a PoL post hoc\ntraining is akin to finding different trajectories with the same endpoint in\nnon-convex learning. Yet, we do not rigorously know if priori knowledge of the\nfinal model weights helps discover such trajectories.\nWe conclude that, until the aforementioned open problems are addressed,\nrelying more heavily on cryptography is likely needed to formulate a new class\nof PoL protocols with formal robustness guarantees. In particular, this will\nhelp with establishing precedence. As a by-product of insights from our\nanalysis, we also demonstrate two novel attacks against PoL.",

Lately, the effectiveness of using graph\nneural networks (GNNs) with vectorized representations for trajectory\nprediction has been demonstrated by many researchers. Nonetheless, these\nalgorithms either pay little attention to models' generalizability across\nvarious scenarios or simply assume training and test data follow similar\nstatistics. In fact, when test scenarios are unseen or Out-of-Distribution\n(OOD), the resulting train-test domain shift usually leads to significant\ndegradation in prediction performance, which will impact downstream modules and\neventually lead to severe accidents. Therefore, it is of great importance to\nthoroughly investigate the prediction models in terms of their\ngeneralizability, which can not only help identify their weaknesses but also\nprovide insights on how to improve these models. This paper proposes a\ngeneralizability analysis framework using feature attribution methods to help\ninterpret black-box models. For the case study, we provide an in-depth\ngeneralizability analysis of one of the state-of-the-art graph-based trajectory\npredictors that utilize vectorized representation.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is one of the global leading causes of cancer-related\ndeaths. Despite the success of Deep Learning in computer-aided diagnosis and\ndetection (CAD) methods, little attention has been paid to the detection of\nPancreatic Cancer. We propose a method for detecting pancreatic tumor that\nutilizes clinically-relevant features in the surrounding anatomical structures,\nthereby better aiming to exploit the radiologist's knowledge compared to other,\nconventional deep learning approaches. To this end, we collect a new dataset\nconsisting of 99 cases with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and 97\ncontrol cases without any pancreatic tumor. Due to the growth pattern of\npancreatic cancer, the tumor may not be always visible as a hypodense lesion,\ntherefore experts refer to the visibility of secondary external features that\nmay indicate the presence of the tumor. We propose a method based on a\nU-Net-like Deep CNN that exploits the following external secondary features:\nthe pancreatic duct, common bile duct and the pancreas, along with a processed\nCT scan. Using these features, the model segments the pancreatic tumor if it is\npresent. This segmentation for classification and localization approach\nachieves a performance of 99% sensitivity (one case missed) and 99%\nspecificity, which realizes a 5% increase in sensitivity over the previous\nstate-of-the-art method. The model additionally provides location information\nwith reasonable accuracy and a shorter inference time compared to previous PDAC\ndetection methods.

Saliency maps, which emphasize\nsalient regions largely connected to the network's decision-making, are one of\nthe most common ways for visualizing and analyzing deep networks in the\ncomputer vision community. However, saliency maps generated by existing methods\ncannot represent authentic information in images due to the unproven proposals\nabout the weights of activation maps which lack solid theoretical foundation\nand fail to consider the relations between each pixel.

    "title": "Blackbox Attacks via Surrogate Ensemble Search",
    "abstract": "Blackbox adversarial attacks can be categorized into transfer- and\nquery-based attacks. Transfer methods do not require any feedback from the\nvictim model, but provide lower success rates compared to query-based methods.\nQuery attacks often require a large number of queries for success. To achieve\nthe best of both approaches, recent efforts have tried to combine them, but\nstill require hundreds of queries to achieve high success rates (especially for\ntargeted attacks). In this paper, we propose a novel method for blackbox\nattacks via surrogate ensemble search (BASES) that can generate highly\nsuccessful blackbox attacks using an extremely small number of queries. We\nfirst define a perturbation machine that generates a perturbed image by\nminimizing a weighted loss function over a fixed set of surrogate models. To\ngenerate an attack for a given victim model, we search over the weights in the\nloss function using queries generated by the perturbation machine. Since the\ndimension of the search space is small (same as the number of surrogate\nmodels), the search requires a small number of queries. We demonstrate that our\nproposed method achieves better success rate with at least 30x fewer queries\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods on different image classifiers trained\nwith ImageNet (including VGG-19, DenseNet-121, and ResNext-50). In particular,\nour method requires as few as 3 queries per image (on average) to achieve more\nthan a 90% success rate for targeted attacks and 1-2 queries per image for over\na 99% success rate for non-targeted attacks. Our method is also effective on\nGoogle Cloud Vision API and achieved a 91% non-targeted attack success rate\nwith 2.9 queries per image. We also show that the perturbations generated by\nour proposed method are highly transferable and can be adopted for hard-label\nblackbox attacks.",

Effective use of mental health prediction or\ndetection models can help mental health practitioners re-define mental\nillnesses more objectively than currently done, and identify illnesses at an\nearlier stage when interventions may be more effective. However, there is still\na lack of standard in evaluating bias in such machine learning models in the\nfield, which leads to challenges in providing reliable predictions and in\naddressing disparities. This lack of standards persists due to factors such as\ntechnical difficulties, complexities of high dimensional clinical health data,\netc., which are especially true for physiological signals.

Most\ntwo-stage 3D detectors utilize grid points, voxel grids, or sampled keypoints\nfor RoI feature extraction in the second stage. Such methods, however, are\ninefficient in handling unevenly distributed and sparse outdoor points. This\npaper solves this problem in three aspects. 1) Dynamic Point Aggregation. We\npropose the patch search to quickly search points in a local region for each 3D\nproposal. The dynamic farthest voxel sampling is then applied to evenly sample\nthe points. Especially, the voxel size varies along the distance to accommodate\nthe uneven distribution of points. 2) RoI-graph Pooling. We build local graphs\non the sampled points to better model contextual information and mine point\nrelations through iterative message passing. 3) Visual Features Augmentation.\nWe introduce a simple yet effective fusion strategy to compensate for sparse\nLiDAR points with limited semantic cues. Based on these modules, we construct\nour Graph R-CNN as the second stage, which can be applied to existing one-stage\ndetectors to consistently improve the detection performance.

    "abstract": "Micro-video background music recommendation is a complicated task where the\nmatching degree between videos and uploader-selected background music is a\nmajor issue. However, the selection of the user-generated content (UGC) is\nbiased caused by knowledge limitations and historical preferences among music\nof each uploader. In this paper, we propose a Debiased Cross-Modal (DebCM)\nmatching model to alleviate the influence of such selection bias. Specifically,\nwe design a teacher-student network to utilize the matching of segments of\nmusic videos, which is professional-generated content (PGC) with specialized\nmusic-matching techniques, to better alleviate the bias caused by insufficient\nknowledge of users. The PGC data is captured by a teacher network to guide the\nmatching of uploader-selected UGC data of the student network by KL-based\nknowledge transfer. In addition, uploaders' personal preferences of music\ngenres are identified as confounders that spuriously correlate music embeddings\nand background music selections, resulting in the learned recommender system to\nover-recommend music from the majority groups. To resolve such confounders in\nthe UGC data of the student network, backdoor adjustment is utilized to\ndeconfound the spurious correlation between music embeddings and prediction\nscores. We further utilize Monte Carlo (MC) estimator with batch-level average\nas the approximations to avoid integrating the entire confounder space\ncalculated by the adjustment.

FL allows clients to update model parameters\nlocally for several epochs, then share them to a global model for aggregation.\nThis training paradigm with multi-local step updating before aggregation\nexposes unique vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is\na popular and effective method to improve the robustness of networks against\nadversaries. In this work, we formulate a general form of federated adversarial\nlearning (FAL) that is adapted from adversarial learning in the centralized\nsetting. On the client side of FL training, FAL has an inner loop to generate\nadversarial samples for adversarial training and an outer loop to update local\nmodel parameters. On the server side, FAL aggregates local model updates and\nbroadcast the aggregated model. We design a global robust training loss and\nformulate FAL training as a min-max optimization problem. Unlike the\nconvergence analysis in classical centralized training that relies on the\ngradient direction, it is significantly harder to analyze the convergence in\nFAL for three reasons: 1) the complexity of min-max optimization, 2) model not\nupdating in the gradient direction due to the multi-local updates on the\nclient-side before aggregation and 3) inter-client heterogeneity. We address\nthese challenges by using appropriate gradient approximation and coupling\ntechniques and present the convergence analysis in the over-parameterized\nregime.

In this paper, we point out that this\nroots in a defective yet common design in existing CNN architectures, namely\nthe use of strided convolution and/or pooling layers, which results in a loss\nof fine-grained information and learning of less effective feature\nrepresentations. To this end, we propose a new CNN building block called\nSPD-Conv in place of each strided convolution layer and each pooling layer\n(thus eliminates them altogether).

However, it can be prohibitively expensive to obtain\nsufficient annotation for source datasets in many real scenarios. To escape\nfrom the dilemma between domain generalization and annotation costs, in this\npaper, we introduce a novel task named label-efficient domain generalization\n(LEDG) to enable model generalization with label-limited source domains. To\naddress this challenging task, we propose a novel framework called\nCollaborative Exploration and Generalization (CEG) which jointly optimizes\nactive exploration and semi-supervised generalization. Specifically, in active\nexploration, to explore class and domain discriminability while avoiding\ninformation divergence and redundancy, we query the labels of the samples with\nthe highest overall ranking of class uncertainty, domain representativeness,\nand information diversity. In semi-supervised generalization, we design\nMixUp-based intra- and inter-domain knowledge augmentation to expand domain\nknowledge and generalize domain invariance. We unify active exploration and\nsemi-supervised generalization in a collaborative way and promote mutual\nenhancement between them, boosting model generalization with limited\nannotation. Extensive experiments show that CEG yields superior generalization\nperformance. In particular, CEG can even use only 5% data annotation budget to\nachieve competitive results compared to the previous DG methods with fully\nlabeled data on PACS dataset.",

    "abstract": "Transformers are considered one of the most important deep learning models\nsince 2018, in part because it establishes state-of-the-art (SOTA) records and\ncould potentially replace existing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Despite the\nremarkable triumphs, the prolonged turnaround time of Transformer models is a\nwidely recognized roadblock. The variety of sequence lengths imposes additional\ncomputing overhead where inputs need to be zero-padded to the maximum sentence\nlength in the batch to accommodate the parallel computing platforms. This paper\ntargets the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and proposes a coherent\nsequence length adaptive algorithm-hardware co-design for Transformer\nacceleration. Particularly, we develop a hardware-friendly sparse attention\noperator and a length-aware hardware resource scheduling algorithm. The\nproposed sparse attention operator brings the complexity of attention-based\nmodels down to linear complexity and alleviates the off-chip memory traffic.\nThe proposed length-aware resource hardware scheduling algorithm dynamically\nallocates the hardware resources to fill up the pipeline slots and eliminates\nbubbles for NLP tasks. Experiments show that our design has very small accuracy\nloss and has 80.2 $\\times$ and 2.6 $\\times$ speedup compared to CPU and GPU\nimplementation, and 4 $\\times$ higher energy efficiency than state-of-the-art\nGPU accelerator optimized via CUBLAS GEMM.",

    "abstract": "The development of IoT technology enables a variety of sensors can be\nintegrated into mobile devices. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on\nsensor data has become an active research topic in the field of machine\nlearning and ubiquitous computing. However, due to the inconsistent frequency\nof human activities, the amount of data for each activity in the human activity\ndataset is imbalanced. Considering the limited sensor resources and the high\ncost of manually labeled sensor data, human activity recognition is facing the\nchallenge of highly imbalanced activity datasets. In this paper, we propose\nBalancing Sensor Data Generative Adversarial Networks (BSDGAN) to generate\nsensor data for minority human activities. The proposed BSDGAN consists of a\ngenerator model and a discriminator model. Considering the extreme imbalance of\nhuman activity dataset, an autoencoder is employed to initialize the training\nprocess of BSDGAN, ensure the data features of each activity can be learned.\nThe generated activity data is combined with the original dataset to balance\nthe amount of activity data across human activity classes. We deployed multiple\nhuman activity recognition models on two publicly available imbalanced human\nactivity datasets, WISDM and UNIMIB. Experimental results show that the\nproposed BSDGAN can effectively capture the data features of real human\nactivity sensor data, and generate realistic synthetic sensor data. Meanwhile,\nthe balanced activity dataset can effectively help the activity recognition\nmodel to improve the recognition accuracy.",

    "abstract": "To make the earlier medical intervention of infants' cerebral palsy (CP),\nearly diagnosis of brain damage is critical. Although general movements\nassessment(GMA) has shown promising results in early CP detection, it is\nlaborious. Most existing works take videos as input to make fidgety\nmovements(FMs) classification for the GMA automation. Those methods require a\ncomplete observation of videos and can not localize video frames containing\nnormal FMs. Therefore we propose a novel approach named WO-GMA to perform FMs\nlocalization in the weakly supervised online setting. Infant body keypoints are\nfirst extracted as the inputs to WO-GMA. Then WO-GMA performs local\nspatio-temporal extraction followed by two network branches to generate pseudo\nclip labels and model online actions. With the clip-level pseudo labels, the\naction modeling branch learns to detect FMs in an online fashion. Experimental\nresults on a dataset with 757 videos of different infants show that WO-GMA can\nget state-of-the-art video-level classification and cliplevel detection\nresults. Moreover, only the first 20% duration of the video is needed to get\nclassification results as good as fully observed, implying a significantly\nshortened FMs diagnosis time.

Various schemes are proposed to address the\ngeneralization issues, including transfer learning, multi-task learning and\nmeta learning, as well as the robust and adversarial reinforcement learning.\nHowever, there is not a unified formulation of the various schemes, as well as\nthe comprehensive comparisons of methods across different schemes. In this\nwork, we propose a game-theoretic framework for the generalization in\nreinforcement learning, named GiRL, where an RL agent is trained against an\nadversary over a set of tasks, where the adversary can manipulate the\ndistributions over tasks within a given threshold. With different\nconfigurations, GiRL can reduce the various schemes mentioned above.

    "abstract": "This paper tackles the problem of Cross-view Video-based camera Localization\n(CVL). The task is to localize a query camera by leveraging information from\nits past observations, i.e., a continuous sequence of images observed at\nprevious time stamps, and matching them to a large overhead-view satellite\nimage. The critical challenge of this task is to learn a powerful global\nfeature descriptor for the sequential ground-view images while considering its\ndomain alignment with reference satellite images. For this purpose, we\nintroduce CVLNet, which first projects the sequential ground-view images into\nan overhead view by exploring the ground-and-overhead geometric correspondences\nand then leverages the photo consistency among the projected images to form a\nglobal representation. In this way, the cross-view domain differences are\nbridged. Since the reference satellite images are usually pre-cropped and\nregularly sampled, there is always a misalignment between the query camera\nlocation and its matching satellite image center. Motivated by this, we propose\nestimating the query camera's relative displacement to a satellite image before\nsimilarity matching. In this displacement estimation process, we also consider\nthe uncertainty of the camera location. For example, a camera is unlikely to be\non top of trees. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we collect\nsatellite images from Google Map for the KITTI dataset and construct a new\ncross-view video-based localization benchmark dataset, KITTI-CVL.

As the recognized best solution to CTDE, Weighted QMIX is\ncutting-edge on StarCraft Multi-agent Challenge (SMAC), with a weighting scheme\nimplemented on QMIX to place more emphasis on the optimal joint actions.\nHowever, the fixed weight requires manual tuning according to the application\nscenarios, which painfully prevents Weighted QMIX from being used in broader\nengineering applications.

    "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrate the use of a two-stage supervised framework to\ngenerate images that depict human perception to visual stimuli from EEG,\nreferring to EEG-visual reconstruction. They are, however, unable to reproduce\nthe exact visual stimulus, since it is the human-specified annotation of\nimages, not their data, that determines what the synthesized images are.\nMoreover, synthesized images often suffer from noisy EEG encodings and unstable\ntraining of generative models, making them hard to recognize. Instead, we\npresent a single-stage EEG-visual retrieval paradigm where data of two\nmodalities are correlated, as opposed to their annotations, allowing us to\nrecover the exact visual stimulus for an EEG clip. We maximize the mutual\ninformation between the EEG encoding and associated visual stimulus through\noptimization of a contrastive self-supervised objective, leading to two\nadditional benefits. One, it enables EEG encodings to handle visual classes\nbeyond seen ones during training, since learning is not directed at class\nannotations. In addition, the model is no longer required to generate every\ndetail of the visual stimulus, but rather focuses on cross-modal alignment and\nretrieves images at the instance level, ensuring distinguishable model output.\nEmpirical studies are conducted on the largest single-subject EEG dataset that\nmeasures brain activities evoked by image stimuli. We demonstrate the proposed\napproach completes an instance-level EEG-visual retrieval task which existing\nmethods cannot.

    "abstract": "Time delays in communication networks are one of the main concerns in\ndeploying robots with computation boards on the edge. This article proposes a\nmulti-stage Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) that is capable of\nhandling varying network-induced time delays for establishing a control\nframework being able to guarantee collision-free Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs)\nnavigation. This study introduces a novel approach that considers different\nsampling times by a tree of discretization scenarios contrary to the existing\ntypical multi-stage NMPC where system uncertainties are modeled by a tree of\nscenarios. Additionally, the proposed method considers adaptive weights for the\nmulti-stage NMPC scenarios based on the probability of time delays in the\ncommunication link. As a result of the multi-stage NMPC, the obtained optimal\ncontrol action is valid for multiple sampling times. Finally, the overall\neffectiveness of the proposed novel control framework is demonstrated in\nvarious tests and different simulation environments.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the exponential increase in the demand of wireless data\ntransmission rises the urgency for accurate spectrum sensing approaches to\nimprove spectrum efficiency. The unreliability of conventional spectrum sensing\nmethods by using measurements from a single secondary user (SU) has motivated\nresearch on cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS). In this work, we propose a\nvertical federated learning (VFL) framework to exploit the distributed features\nacross multiple SUs without compromising data privacy. However, the repetitive\ntraining process in VFL faces the issue of high communication latency. To\naccelerate the training process, we propose a truncated vertical federated\nlearning (T-VFL) algorithm, where the training latency is highly reduced by\nintegrating the standard VFL algorithm with a channel-aware user scheduling\npolicy. The convergence performance of T-VFL is provided via mathematical\nanalysis and justified by simulation results. Moreover, to guarantee the\nconvergence performance of the T-VFL algorithm, we conclude three design rules\non the neural architectures used under the VFL framework, whose effectiveness\nis proved through simulations.",

    "abstract": "By coordinating terminal smart devices or microprocessors to engage in\ncooperative computation to achieve systemlevel targets, distributed\noptimization is incrementally favored by both engineering and computer science.\nThe well-known alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has turned\nout to be one of the most popular tools for distributed optimization due to\nmany advantages, such as modular structure, superior convergence, easy\nimplementation and high flexibility. In the past decade, ADMM has experienced\nwidespread developments. The developments manifest in both handling more\ngeneral problems and enabling more effective implementation. Specifically, the\nmethod has been generalized to broad classes of problems (i.e.,multi-block,\ncoupled objective, nonconvex, etc.). Besides, it has been extensively\nreinforced for more effective implementation, such as improved convergence\nrate, easier subproblems, higher computation efficiency, flexible\ncommunication, compatible with inaccurate information, robust to communication\ndelays, etc. These developments lead to a plentiful of ADMM variants to be\ncelebrated by broad areas ranging from smart grids, smart buildings, wireless\ncommunications, machine learning and beyond. However, there lacks a survey to\ndocument those developments and discern the results. To achieve such a goal,\nthis paper provides a comprehensive survey on ADMM variants. Particularly, we\ndiscern the five major classes of problems that have been mostly concerned and\ndiscuss the related ADMM variants in terms of main ideas, main assumptions,\nconvergence behaviors and main features. In addition, we figure out several\nimportant future research directions to be addressed. This survey is expected\nto work as a tutorial for both developing distributed optimization in broad\nareas and identifying existing theoretical research gaps.",

Some multi-view learning methods assume that the\nmulti-view data is complete, which means that all instances are present, but\nthis too ideal.

In addition, adaptive weights are equipped to each view to adjust the\nimportance of different views.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in complex network analysis opened a wide range of\npossibilities for applications in diverse fields. The power of the network\nanalysis depends on the node features. The topology-based node features are\nrealizations of local and global spatial relations and node connectivity\nstructure. Hence, collecting correct information on the node characteristics\nand the connectivity structure of the neighboring nodes plays the most\nprominent role in node classification and link prediction in complex network\nanalysis. The present work introduces a new feature abstraction method, namely\nthe Transition Probabilities Matrix (TPM), based on embedding anonymous random\nwalks on feature vectors. The node feature vectors consist of transition\nprobabilities obtained from sets of walks in a predefined radius. The\ntransition probabilities are directly related to the local connectivity\nstructure, hence correctly embedded onto feature vectors. The success of the\nproposed embedding method is tested on node identification/classification and\nlink prediction on three commonly used real-world networks. In real-world\nnetworks, nodes with similar connectivity structures are common; Thus,\nobtaining information from similar networks for predictions on the new networks\nis the distinguishing characteristic that makes the proposed algorithm superior\nto the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of cross-networks generalization\ntasks.",

Especially in the coming era of Shared Autonomous\nVehicles (SAVs), parking operations in urban transportation networks will\ninevitably change. Parking stations will serve as storage places for unused\nvehicles and depots that control the level-of-service of SAVs. This study\npresents an Analytical Parking Planning Model (APPM) for the SAV environment to\nprovide broader insights into parking planning decisions. Two specific planning\nscenarios are considered for the APPM: (i) Single-zone APPM (S-APPM), which\nconsiders the target area as a single homogeneous zone, and (ii) Two-zone APPM\n(T-APPM), which considers the target area as two different zones, such as city\ncenter and suburban area. S-APPM offers a closed-form solution to find the\noptimal density of parking stations and parking spaces and the optimal number\nof SAV fleets, which is beneficial for understanding the explicit relationship\nbetween planning decisions and the given environments, including demand density\nand cost factors. In addition, to incorporate different macroscopic\ncharacteristics across two zones, T-APPM accounts for inter- and intra-zonal\npassenger trips and the relocation of vehicles. We conduct a case study to\ndemonstrate the proposed method with the actual data collected in Seoul\nMetropolitan Area, South Korea.

To gain strategic advantages in\nthe technological competitions between regions, nations need to leverage the\ninvestments of public and private funds to diversify over all technologies or\nspecialize in a small number of technologies. In this paper, we investigated\nwho the leaders are at the regional and assignee levels, how they attained\ntheir leadership positions, and whether they adopted diversification or\nspecialization strategies, using a dataset of 176,193 patent records on\ngraphene between 1986 and 2017 downloaded from Derwent Innovation. By applying\na co-clustering method to the IPC subclasses in the patents and using a z-score\nmethod to extract keywords from their titles and abstracts, we identified seven\ngraphene technology areas emerging in the sequence synthesis - composites -\nsensors - devices - catalyst - batteries - water treatment. We then examined\nthe top regions in their investment preferences and their changes in rankings\nover time and found that they invested in all seven technology areas. In\ncontrast, at the assignee level, some were diversified while others were\nspecialized. We found that large entities diversified their portfolios across\nmultiple technology areas, while small entities specialized around their core\ncompetencies. In addition, we found that universities had higher entropy values\nthan corporations on average, leading us to the hypothesis that corporations\nfile, buy, or sell patents to enable product development.

    "abstract": "Multi-object tracking in videos requires to solve a fundamental problem of\none-to-one assignment between objects in adjacent frames. Most methods address\nthe problem by first discarding impossible pairs whose feature distances are\nlarger than a threshold, followed by linking objects using Hungarian algorithm\nto minimize the overall distance. However, we find that the distribution of the\ndistances computed from Re-ID features may vary significantly for different\nvideos. So there isn't a single optimal threshold which allows us to safely\ndiscard impossible pairs. To address the problem, we present an efficient\napproach to compute a marginal probability for each pair of objects in real\ntime. The marginal probability can be regarded as a normalized distance which\nis significantly more stable than the original feature distance. As a result,\nwe can use a single threshold for all videos. The approach is general and can\nbe applied to the existing trackers to obtain about one point improvement in\nterms of IDF1 metric. It achieves competitive results on MOT17 and MOT20\nbenchmarks. In addition, the computed probability is more interpretable which\nfacilitates subsequent post-processing operations.",

    "abstract": "Recently, intent-based management is receiving good attention in telecom\nnetworks owing to stringent performance requirements for many of the use cases.\nSeveral approaches on the literature employ traditional methods in the telecom\ndomain to fulfill intents on the KPIs, which can be defined as a closed loop.\nHowever, these methods consider every closed-loop independent of each other\nwhich degrades the combined closed-loop performance. Also, when many closed\nloops are needed, these methods are not easily scalable. Multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) techniques have shown significant promise in many\nareas in which traditional closed-loop control falls short, typically for\ncomplex coordination and conflict management among loops. In this work, we\npropose a method based on MARL to achieve intent-based management without the\nrequirement of the model of the underlying system. Moreover, when there are\nconflicting intents, the MARL agents can implicitly incentivize the loops to\ncooperate, without human interaction, by prioritizing the important KPIs.\nExperiments have been performed on a network emulator on optimizing KPIs for\nthree services and we observe the proposed system performs well and is able to\nfulfill all existing intents when there are enough resources or prioritize the\nKPIs when there are scarce resources.",

    "abstract": "We study how to represent a video with implicit neural representations\n(INRs). Classical INRs methods generally utilize MLPs to map input coordinates\nto output pixels. While some recent works have tried to directly reconstruct\nthe whole image with CNNs. However, we argue that both the above pixel-wise and\nimage-wise strategies are not favorable to video data. Instead, we propose a\npatch-wise solution, PS-NeRV, which represents videos as a function of patches\nand the corresponding patch coordinate. It naturally inherits the advantages of\nimage-wise methods, and achieves excellent reconstruction performance with fast\ndecoding speed. The whole method includes conventional modules, like positional\nembedding, MLPs and CNNs, while also introduces AdaIN to enhance intermediate\nfeatures. These simple yet essential changes could help the network easily fit\nhigh-frequency details.

    "abstract": "The Scene Graph Generation (SGG) task aims to detect all the objects and\ntheir pairwise visual relationships in a given image. Although SGG has achieved\nremarkable progress over the last few years, almost all existing SGG models\nfollow the same training paradigm: they treat both object and predicate\nclassification in SGG as a single-label classification problem, and the\nground-truths are one-hot target labels. However, this prevalent training\nparadigm has overlooked two characteristics of current SGG datasets: 1) For\npositive samples, some specific subject-object instances may have multiple\nreasonable predicates. 2) For negative samples, there are numerous missing\nannotations. Regardless of the two characteristics, SGG models are easy to be\nconfused and make wrong predictions. To this end, we propose a novel\nmodel-agnostic Label Semantic Knowledge Distillation (LS-KD) for unbiased SGG.\nSpecifically, LS-KD dynamically generates a soft label for each subject-object\ninstance by fusing a predicted Label Semantic Distribution (LSD) with its\noriginal one-hot target label. LSD reflects the correlations between this\ninstance and multiple predicate categories. Meanwhile, we propose two different\nstrategies to predict LSD: iterative self-KD and synchronous self-KD. Extensive\nablations and results on three SGG tasks have attested to the superiority and\ngenerality of our proposed LS-KD, which can consistently achieve decent\ntrade-off performance between different predicate categories.",

    "abstract": "Progress in GANs has enabled the generation of high-resolution photorealistic\nimages of astonishing quality. StyleGANs allow for compelling attribute\nmodification on such images via mathematical operations on the latent style\nvectors in the W/W+ space that effectively modulate the rich hierarchical\nrepresentations of the generator. Such operations have recently been\ngeneralized beyond mere attribute swapping in the original StyleGAN paper to\ninclude interpolations. In spite of many significant improvements in StyleGANs,\nthey are still seen to generate unnatural images. The quality of the generated\nimages is predicated on two assumptions; (a) The richness of the hierarchical\nrepresentations learnt by the generator, and, (b) The linearity and smoothness\nof the style spaces. In this work, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic\nRegularizer (HSR) which aligns the hierarchical representations learnt by the\ngenerator to corresponding powerful features learnt by pretrained networks on\nlarge amounts of data. HSR is shown to not only improve generator\nrepresentations but also the linearity and smoothness of the latent style\nspaces, leading to the generation of more natural-looking style-edited images.\nTo demonstrate improved linearity, we propose a novel metric - Attribute\nLinearity Score (ALS). A significant reduction in the generation of unnatural\nimages is corroborated by improvement in the Perceptual Path Length (PPL)\nmetric by 16.19% averaged across different standard datasets while\nsimultaneously improving the linearity of attribute-change in the attribute\nediting tasks.",

    "abstract": "In class-incremental learning, the model is expected to learn new classes\ncontinually while maintaining knowledge on previous classes. The challenge here\nlies in preserving the model's ability to effectively represent prior classes\nin the feature space, while adapting it to represent incoming new classes. We\npropose two distillation-based objectives for class incremental learning that\nleverage the structure of the feature space to maintain accuracy on previous\nclasses, as well as enable learning the new classes. In our first objective,\ntermed cross-space clustering (CSC), we propose to use the feature space\nstructure of the previous model to characterize directions of optimization that\nmaximally preserve the class - directions that all instances of a specific\nclass should collectively optimize towards, and those that they should\ncollectively optimize away from. Apart from minimizing forgetting, this\nindirectly encourages the model to cluster all instances of a class in the\ncurrent feature space, and gives rise to a sense of herd-immunity, allowing all\nsamples of a class to jointly combat the model from forgetting the class. Our\nsecond objective termed controlled transfer (CT) tackles incremental learning\nfrom an understudied perspective of inter-class transfer. CT explicitly\napproximates and conditions the current model on the semantic similarities\nbetween incrementally arriving classes and prior classes. This allows the model\nto learn classes in such a way that it maximizes positive forward transfer from\nsimilar prior classes, thus increasing plasticity, and minimizes negative\nbackward transfer on dissimilar prior classes, whereby strengthening stability.\nWe perform extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, adding our method\n(CSCCT) on top of three prominent class-incremental learning methods. We\nobserve consistent performance improvement on a variety of experimental\nsettings.",

This paper is aimed to design an optimized\nmicro-propulsion system, Cold Gas Thruster, to de-orbit the PSLV debris from\n668km to 250 km height after capturing process. The propulsion system mainly\nconsists of a storage tank, pipes, control valves, and a convergent-divergent\nnozzle. The paper gives an idea of the design of each component based on a\ncontinuous iterative process until the design thrust requirements are met. All\nthe components are designed in the CATIA V5, and the structural analysis is\ndone in the ANSYS tool for each component where our cylinder tank can withstand\nthe high hoop stress generated on its wall of it. And flow analysis is done by\nusing the K-$\\epsilon$ turbulence model for the CD nozzle, which provides the\nrequired thrust to de-orbit PSLV from a higher orbit to a lower orbit, after\nwhich the air drag will be enough to bring back to earth\\'s atmosphere and burn\nit.

When training\na detector to detect the cancer cells in a WSI (Whole Slice Image) image\ncaptured from the TCT (Thinprep Cytology Test) specimen, head categories (e.g.\nnormal cells and inflammatory cells) typically have a much larger number of\nsamples than tail categories (e.g. cancer cells). Most existing\nstate-of-the-art long-tailed learning methods in object detection focus on\ncategory distribution statistics to solve the problem in the long-tailed\nscenario without considering the \"hardness\" of each sample. To address this\nproblem, in this work we propose a Grad-Libra Loss that leverages the gradients\nto dynamically calibrate the degree of hardness of each sample for different\ncategories, and re-balance the gradients of positive and negative samples. Our\nloss can thus help the detector to put more emphasis on those hard samples in\nboth head and tail categories. Extensive experiments on a long-tailed TCT WSI\nimage dataset show that the mainstream detectors, e.g. RepPoints, FCOS, ATSS,\nYOLOF, etc. trained using our proposed Gradient-Libra Loss, achieved much\nhigher (7.8%) mAP than that trained using cross-entropy classification loss.",

Mirai, a notorious IoT malware, is one of the\nrepresentative threats; it infects many IoT devices and turns them into\nbotnets, and the botnets rapidly spread infection over IoT networks. It seems\nhard to eliminate the chance of devices being infected with malware completely.\nTherefore, we believe it is essential to consider systems that enable us to\nremotely stop (or control) infected devices as soon as possible to prevent or\nlimit malicious behaviors of infected devices. In this paper, we design a\npromising candidate for such remote-control systems, called IoT-REX\n(REemote-Control System for IoT devices). IoT-REX allows a systems manager to\ndesignate an arbitrary subset of all IoT devices in the system and generate\nauthenticated information that contains any command the system manager wants.\nEvery device can confirm whether or not the device itself was designated; if\nso, the device executes the command. Towards realizing IoT-REX, we introduce a\nnovel cryptographic primitive called centralized multi-designated verifier\nsignatures (CMDVS). Although CMDVS works under a restricted condition compared\nto conventional MDVS, it is sufficient for realizing IoT-REX. We provide an\nefficient CMDVS construction from any approximate membership query structures\nand digital signatures, yielding compact communication sizes and efficient\nverification procedures for IoT-REX.",

If the platform is secure under a\nsufficiently strong threat model, it can provide the missing link to enabling\npowerful analytics of sensitive personal data, by alleviating data subjects'\nconcerns about leakage and misuse of data. For instance, many types of powerful\nanalytics that benefit public health, mobility, infrastructure, finance, or\nsustainable energy can be made differentially private, thus alleviating\nconcerns about privacy. However, no platform currently exists that is\nsufficiently secure to alleviate concerns about data leakage and misuse; as a\nresult, many types of analytics that would be in the interest of data subjects\nand the public are not done.

GHA approximates the regular global\ndot-product attention via a series of coarsening and interpolation operations\nover multiple hierarchy levels. The advantage of GHA is two-fold. First, it has\nlinear complexity with respect to the number of points, enabling the processing\nof large point clouds. Second, GHA inherently possesses the inductive bias to\nfocus on spatially close points, while retaining the global connectivity among\nall points. Combined with a feedforward network, GHA can be inserted into many\nexisting network architectures. We experiment with multiple baseline networks\nand show that adding GHA consistently improves performance across different\ntasks and datasets. For the task of semantic segmentation, GHA gives a +1.7%\nmIoU increase to the MinkowskiEngine baseline on ScanNet. For the 3D object\ndetection task, GHA improves the CenterPoint baseline by +0.5% mAP on the\nnuScenes dataset, and the 3DETR baseline by +2.1% mAP25 and +1.5% mAP50 on\nScanNet.",

To mitigate this problem, we\npropose a powerful RGBD fusion network, SwinDRNet, for depth restoration. We\nfurther propose Domain Randomization-Enhanced Depth Simulation (DREDS) approach\nto simulate an active stereo depth system using physically based rendering and\ngenerate a large-scale synthetic dataset that contains 130K photorealistic RGB\nimages along with their simulated depths carrying realistic sensor noises. To\nevaluate depth restoration methods, we also curate a real-world dataset, namely\nSTD, that captures 30 cluttered scenes composed of 50 objects with different\nmaterials from specular, transparent, to diffuse. Experiments demonstrate that\nthe proposed DREDS dataset bridges the sim-to-real domain gap such that,\ntrained on DREDS, our SwinDRNet can seamlessly generalize to other real depth\ndatasets, e.g. ClearGrasp, and outperform the competing methods on depth\nrestoration with a real-time speed.

To facilitate efficient resource allocation design for large IRSs,\nwe employ a codebook-based optimization framework, where the IRS is divided\ninto several tiles and the phase-shift elements of each tile are selected from\na pre-defined codebook. The resource allocation algorithm design is formulated\nas an optimization problem for the maximization of the average sum data rate of\nthe eMBB users over a time slot while guaranteeing the quality-of-service (QoS)\nof each URLLC user in each mini-slot. An iterative algorithm based on\nalternating optimization (AO) is proposed to find a high-quality suboptimal\nsolution. As a case study, the proposed algorithm is applied in an industrial\nindoor environment modelled via the Quadriga channel simulator. Our simulation\nresults show that the proposed algorithm design enables the coexistence of eMBB\nand URLLC users and yields large performance gains compared to three baseline\nschemes.

    "abstract": "Recent work has highlighted the risks of intellectual property (IP) piracy of\ndeep learning (DL) models from the side-channel leakage of DL hardware\naccelerators. In response, to provide side-channel leakage resiliency to DL\nhardware accelerators, several approaches have been proposed, mainly borrowed\nfrom the methodologies devised for cryptographic implementations. Therefore, as\nexpected, the same challenges posed by the complex design of such\ncountermeasures should be dealt with. This is despite the fact that fundamental\ncryptographic approaches, specifically secure and private function evaluation,\ncould potentially improve the robustness against side-channel leakage. To\nexamine this and weigh the costs and benefits, we introduce hardware garbled NN\n(HWGN2), a DL hardware accelerator implemented on FPGA. HWGN2 also provides NN\ndesigners with the flexibility to protect their IP in real-time applications,\nwhere hardware resources are heavily constrained, through a\nhardware-communication cost trade-off. Concretely, we apply garbled circuits,\nimplemented using a MIPS architecture that achieves up to 62.5x fewer logical\nand 66x less memory utilization than the state-of-the-art approaches at the\nprice of communication overhead. Further, the side-channel resiliency of HWGN2\nis demonstrated by employing the test vector leakage assessment (TVLA) test\nagainst both power and electromagnetic side-channels. This is in addition to\nthe inherent feature of HWGN2: it ensures the privacy of users' input,\nincluding the architecture of NNs.

    "abstract": "We consider the Stochastic Boolean Function Evaluation (SBFE) problem where\nthe task is to efficiently evaluate a known Boolean function $f$ on an unknown\nbit string $x$ of length $n$. We determine $f(x)$ by sequentially testing the\nvariables of $x$, each of which is associated with a cost of testing and an\nindependent probability of being true. If a strategy for solving the problem is\nadaptive in the sense that its next test can depend on the outcomes of previous\ntests, it has lower expected cost but may take up to exponential space to\nstore. In contrast, a non-adaptive strategy may have higher expected cost but\ncan be stored in linear space and benefit from parallel resources. The\nadaptivity gap, the ratio between the expected cost of the optimal non-adaptive\nand adaptive strategies, is a measure of the benefit of adaptivity. We present\nlower bounds on the adaptivity gap for the SBFE problem for popular classes of\nBoolean functions, including read-once DNF formulas, read-once formulas, and\ngeneral DNFs.

Recently, pose information\n(i.e., locations of keypoints or skeleton) has been used to interpret social\nbehaviours of mice. Nevertheless, effective encoding and decoding of social\ninteraction information underlying the keypoints of mice has been rarely\ninvestigated in the existing methods. In particular, it is challenging to model\ncomplex social interactions between mice due to highly deformable body shapes\nand ambiguous movement patterns. To deal with the interaction modelling\nproblem, we here propose a Cross-Skeleton Interaction Graph Aggregation Network\n(CS-IGANet) to learn abundant dynamics of freely interacting mice, where a\nCross-Skeleton Node-level Interaction module (CS-NLI) is used to model\nmulti-level interactions (i.e., intra-, inter- and cross-skeleton\ninteractions).

However, current approaches are limited to their insufficient\nexpressive power for relationships between instruments. Hence, we propose a\ngraph representation learning framework to comprehensively represent instrument\nmotions in the surgical workflow anticipation problem. In our proposed graph\nrepresentation, we maps the bounding box information of instruments to the\ngraph nodes in the consecutive frames and build inter-frame/inter-instrument\ngraph edges to represent the trajectory and interaction of the instruments over\ntime.

Scientists and\njournalists often communicate these incremental findings to lay people through\nvisualizations and text (e.g., the positive and negative effects of caffeine\nintake). Consequently, readers need to integrate diverse and contrasting\nevidence from multiple sources to form opinions or make decisions. However, the\nunderlying mechanism for synthesizing information from multiple visualizations\nremains underexplored. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a series of\nfour experiments (N = 1166) in which participants synthesized empirical\nevidence from a pair of line charts presented sequentially. In Experiment 1, we\nadministered a baseline condition with charts depicting no specific context\nwhere participants held no strong belief. To test for the generalizability, we\nintroduced real-world scenarios to our visualizations in Experiment 2, and\nadded accompanying text descriptions similar to on-line news articles or blog\nposts in Experiment 3. In all three experiments, we varied the relative\ndirection and magnitude of line slopes within the chart pairs. We found that\nparticipants tended to weigh the positive slope more when the two charts\ndepicted relationships in the opposite direction (e.g., one positive slope and\none negative slope). Participants tended to weigh the less steep slope when the\ntwo charts depicted relationships in the same direction (e.g., both positive).\nThrough these experiments, we characterize participants' synthesis behaviors\ndepending on the relationship between the information they viewed, contribute\nto theories describing underlying cognitive mechanisms in information\nsynthesis, and describe design implications for data storytelling.",

In this work, we consider the celebrated\ndefinition of counterfactual fairness [Kusner et al., NeurIPS, 2017]. We begin\nby showing that an algorithm which satisfies counterfactual fairness also\nsatisfies demographic parity, a far simpler fairness constraint. Similarly, we\nshow that all algorithms satisfying demographic parity can be trivially\nmodified to satisfy counterfactual fairness. Together, our results indicate\nthat counterfactual fairness is basically equivalent to demographic parity,\nwhich has important implications for the growing body of work on counterfactual\nfairness. We then validate our theoretical findings empirically, analyzing\nthree existing algorithms for counterfactual fairness against three simple\nbenchmarks. We find that two simple benchmark algorithms outperform all three\nexisting algorithms -- in terms of fairness, accuracy, and efficiency -- on\nseveral data sets. Our analysis leads us to formalize a concrete fairness goal:\nto preserve the order of individuals within protected groups. We believe\ntransparency around the ordering of individuals within protected groups makes\nfair algorithms more trustworthy.

    "abstract": "In a constructive setting, no concrete formulation of ordinal numbers can\nsimultaneously have all the properties one might be interested in; for example,\nbeing able to calculate limits of sequences is constructively incompatible with\ndeciding extensional equality. Using homotopy type theory as the foundational\nsetting, we develop an abstract framework for ordinal theory and establish a\ncollection of desirable properties and constructions. We then study and compare\nthree concrete implementations of ordinals in homotopy type theory: first, a\nnotation system based on Cantor normal forms (binary trees); second, a refined\nversion of Brouwer trees (infinitely-branching trees); and third, extensional\nwell-founded orders.\nEach of our three formulations has the central properties expected of\nordinals, such as being equipped with an extensional and well-founded ordering\nas well as allowing basic arithmetic operations, but they differ with respect\nto what they make possible in addition. For example, for finite collections of\nordinals, Cantor normal forms have decidable properties, but suprema of\ninfinite collections cannot be computed. In contrast, extensional well-founded\norders work well with infinite collections, but almost all properties are\nundecidable. Brouwer trees take the sweet spot in the middle by combining a\nrestricted form of decidability with the ability to work with infinite\nincreasing sequences.\nOur three approaches are connected by canonical order-preserving functions\nfrom the \"more decidable\" to the \"less decidable\" notions. We have formalised\nthe results on Cantor normal forms and Brouwer trees in cubical Agda, while\nextensional well-founded orders have been studied and formalised thoroughly by\nEscardo and his collaborators.

However, these systems struggle to\nshow robustness in extreme weather conditions because sensors like lidars and\ncameras, which are the primary sensors in a sensor suite, see a decline in\nperformance under these conditions. In order to solve this problem,\ncamera-radar fusion systems provide a unique opportunity for all weather\nreliable high quality perception.

    "title": "Learning Entity Linking Features for Emerging Entities",
    "abstract": "Entity linking (EL) is the process of linking entity mentions appearing in\ntext with their corresponding entities in a knowledge base. EL features of\nentities (e.g., prior probability, relatedness score, and entity embedding) are\nusually estimated based on Wikipedia. However, for newly emerging entities\n(EEs) which have just been discovered in news, they may still not be included\nin Wikipedia yet. As a consequence, it is unable to obtain required EL features\nfor those EEs from Wikipedia and EL models will always fail to link ambiguous\nmentions with those EEs correctly as the absence of their EL features. To deal\nwith this problem, in this paper we focus on a new task of learning EL features\nfor emerging entities in a general way. We propose a novel approach called\nSTAMO to learn high-quality EL features for EEs automatically, which needs just\na small number of labeled documents for each EE collected from the Web, as it\ncould further leverage the knowledge hidden in the unlabeled data. STAMO is\nmainly based on self-training, which makes it flexibly integrated with any EL\nfeature or EL model, but also makes it easily suffer from the error\nreinforcement problem caused by the mislabeled data. Instead of some common\nself-training strategies that try to throw the mislabeled data away explicitly,\nwe regard self-training as a multiple optimization process with respect to the\nEL features of EEs, and propose both intra-slot and inter-slot optimizations to\nalleviate the error reinforcement problem implicitly. We construct two EL\ndatasets involving selected EEs to evaluate the quality of obtained EL features\nfor EEs, and the experimental results show that our approach significantly\noutperforms other baseline methods of learning EL features.",

The basic idea is to cast the robustness\nanalysis of a neural network as a reachability problem and use (i) the\n$\\ell_{\\infty}$-norm input-output Lipschitz constant and (ii) the tight\ninclusion function of the network to over-approximate its reachable sets.\nFirst, for a given implicit neural network, we use $\\ell_{\\infty}$-matrix\nmeasures to propose sufficient conditions for its well-posedness, design an\niterative algorithm to compute its fixed points, and provide upper bounds for\nits $\\ell_\\infty$-norm input-output Lipschitz constant.

Third, we use the upper bounds of the Lipschitz\nconstants and the upper bounds of the tight inclusion functions to design two\nalgorithms for the training and robustness verification of implicit neural\nnetworks.

The use of provenance to\ncommunicate analytic sensemaking carries promise by describing the interactions\nand summarizing the steps taken to reach insights. Yet, no universal guidelines\nexist for communicating provenance in different settings. Our work focuses on\nthe presentation of provenance information and the resulting conclusions\nreached and strategies used by new analysts. In an open-ended, 30-minute,\ntextual exploration scenario, we qualitatively compare how adding different\ntypes of provenance information (specifically data coverage and interaction\nhistory) affects analysts' confidence in conclusions developed, propensity to\nrepeat work, filtering of data, identification of relevant information, and\ntypical investigation strategies. We see that data coverage (i.e., what was\ninteracted with) provides provenance information without limiting individual\ninvestigation freedom. On the other hand, while interaction history (i.e., when\nsomething was interacted with) does not significantly encourage more mimicry,\nit does take more time to comfortably understand, as represented by less\nconfident conclusions and less relevant information-gathering behaviors. Our\nresults contribute empirical data towards understanding how provenance\nsummarizations can influence analysis behaviors.",

In this work, we strive to establish a parametrization space\nthat affords the data-driven representation variance of measured BRDF models\nwhile still offering the artistic control of parametric analytical BRDFs. We\npresent a machine learning approach that generates an interpretable\ndisentangled parameter space. A disentangled representation is one in which\neach parameter is responsible for a unique generative factor and is insensitive\nto the ones encoded by the other parameters. To that end, we resort to a\n$\\beta$-Variational AutoEncoder ($\\beta$-VAE), a specific architecture of Deep\nNeural Network (DNN). After training our network, we analyze the\nparametrization space and interpret the learned generative factors utilizing\nour visual perception. It should be noted that perceptual analysis is called\nupon downstream of the system for interpretation purposes compared to most\nother existing methods where it is used upfront to elaborate the\nparametrization. In addition to that, we do not need a test subject\ninvestigation. A novel feature of our interpretable disentangled\nparametrization is the post-processing capability to incorporate new parameters\nalong with the learned ones, thus expanding the richness of producible\nappearances.

The problem is defined in the following way: given a kernel function\n$f(x,y)$ and a set of points $\\{x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n \\} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$,\nwe would like to compute $\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i,y)$ for any query\npoint $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. Recently, there has been a growing trend of using\ndata structures for efficient KDE. However, the proposed KDE data structures\nfocus on static settings. The robustness of KDE data structures over dynamic\nchanging data distributions is not addressed. In this work, we focus on the\ndynamic maintenance of KDE data structures with robustness to adversarial\nqueries. Especially, we provide a theoretical framework of KDE data structures.\nIn our framework, the KDE data structures only require subquadratic spaces.\nMoreover, our data structure supports the dynamic update of the dataset in\nsublinear time. Furthermore, we can perform adaptive queries with the potential\nadversary in sublinear time.",

    "title": "Depth Quality-Inspired Feature Manipulation for Efficient RGB-D and  Video Salient Object Detection",
    "abstract": "Recently CNN-based RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) has obtained\nsignificant improvement on detection accuracy. However, existing models often\nfail to perform well in terms of efficiency and accuracy simultaneously. This\nhinders their potential applications on mobile devices as well as many\nreal-world problems. To bridge the accuracy gap between lightweight and large\nmodels for RGB-D SOD, in this paper, an efficient module that can greatly\nimprove the accuracy but adds little computation is proposed. Inspired by the\nfact that depth quality is a key factor influencing the accuracy, we propose an\nefficient depth quality-inspired feature manipulation (DQFM) process, which can\ndynamically filter depth features according to depth quality. The proposed DQFM\nresorts to the alignment of low-level RGB and depth features, as well as\nholistic attention of the depth stream to explicitly control and enhance\ncross-modal fusion. We embed DQFM to obtain an efficient lightweight RGB-D SOD\nmodel called DFM-Net, where we in addition design a tailored depth backbone and\na two-stage decoder as basic parts. Extensive experimental results on nine\nRGB-D datasets demonstrate that our DFM-Net outperforms recent efficient\nmodels, running at about 20 FPS on CPU with only 8.5Mb model size, and\nmeanwhile being 2.9/2.4 times faster and 6.7/3.1 times smaller than the latest\nbest models A2dele and MobileSal. It also maintains state-of-the-art accuracy\nwhen even compared to non-efficient models. Interestingly, further statistics\nand analyses verify the ability of DQFM in distinguishing depth maps of various\nqualities without any quality labels. Last but not least, we further apply\nDFM-Net to deal with video SOD (VSOD), achieving comparable performance against\nrecent efficient models while being 3/2.3 times faster/smaller than the prior\nbest in this field.

    "title": "CSSAM:Code Search via Attention Matching of Code Semantics and  Structures",
    "abstract": "Despite the continuous efforts in improving both the effectiveness and\nefficiency of code search, two issues remained unsolved. First, programming\nlanguages have inherent strong structural linkages, and feature mining of code\nas text form would omit the structural information contained inside it. Second,\nthere is a potential semantic relationship between code and query, it is\nchallenging to align code and text across sequences so that vectors are\nspatially consistent during similarity matching. To tackle both issues, in this\npaper, a code search model named CSSAM (Code Semantics and Structures Attention\nMatching) is proposed. By introducing semantic and structural matching\nmechanisms, CSSAM effectively extracts and fuses multidimensional code\nfeatures. Specifically, the cross and residual layer was developed to\nfacilitate high-latitude spatial alignment of code and query at the token\nlevel. By leveraging the residual interaction, a matching module is designed to\npreserve more code semantics and descriptive features, that enhances the\nadhesion between the code and its corresponding query text. Besides, to improve\nthe model's comprehension of the code's inherent structure, a code\nrepresentation structure named CSRG (Code Semantic Representation Graph) is\nproposed for jointly representing abstract syntax tree nodes and the data flow\nof the codes. According to the experimental results on two publicly available\ndatasets containing 540k and 330k code segments, CSSAM significantly\noutperforms the baselines in terms of achieving the highest SR@1/5/10, MRR, and\nNDCG@50 on both datasets respectively. Moreover, the ablation study is\nconducted to quantitatively measure the impact of each key component of CSSAM\non the efficiency and effectiveness of code search, which offers the insights\ninto the improvement of advanced code search solutions.",

    "abstract": "Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks. An\nadversary can find a small perturbation in the input sample to change its\nlatent encoding non-smoothly, thereby compromising the reconstruction. A known\nreason for such vulnerability is the latent space distortions arising from a\nmismatch between approximated latent posterior and a prior distribution.\nConsequently, a slight change in the inputs leads to a significant change in\nthe latent space encodings. This paper demonstrates that the sensitivity around\na data point is due to a directional bias of a stochastic pullback metric\ntensor induced by the encoder network. The pullback metric tensor measures the\ninfinitesimal volume change from input to latent space. Thus, it can be viewed\nas a lens to analyse the effect of small changes in the input leading to\ndistortions in the latent space. We propose robustness evaluation scores using\nthe eigenspectrum of a pullback metric. Moreover, we empirically show that the\nscores correlate with the robustness parameter $\\beta$ of the $\\beta-$VAE.",

For both second-order and moderate deviations\nasymptotics, we consider two types of codebooks: the spherical codebook where\neach codeword is drawn independently and uniformly from the surface of a sphere\nand the i.i.d.

We establish the achievable\nsecond-order rate-region under JEP and we show that under SEP any memoryless\nsource satisfying mild moment conditions is strongly successively refinable.\nWhen specialized to a Gaussian memoryless source (GMS), our results provide an\nalternative achievability proof with specific code design. We show that under\nJEP and SEP, the same moderate deviations constant is achievable. For large\ndeviations asymptotics, we only consider the i.i.d. Gaussian codebook since the\ni.i.d.

This helps marketers in better managing the online\nbehavior of e-commerce customers.

Compared with embedding watermarks directly\ninto DNN parameters, inserting trigger-set watermarks enables us to verify the\nownership without knowing the internal details of the DNN, which is more\nsuitable for application scenarios. The cost is we have to carefully craft the\ntrigger samples. Mainstream methods construct the trigger samples by inserting\na noticeable pattern to the clean samples in the spatial domain, which does not\nconsider sample imperceptibility, sample robustness and model robustness, and\ntherefore has limited the watermarking performance and the model\ngeneralization. It has motivated the authors in this paper to propose a novel\nDNN watermarking method based on Fourier perturbation analysis and frequency\nsensitivity clustering. First, we analyze the perturbation impact of different\nfrequency components of the input sample on the task functionality of the DNN\nby applying random perturbation. Then, by K-means clustering, we determine the\nfrequency components that result in superior watermarking performance for\ncrafting the trigger samples.

This process requires numerous unlabeled training\ndata and computational resources, which makes the pre-trained encoder become\nvaluable intellectual property of the owner. However, the lack of a priori\nknowledge of downstream tasks makes it non-trivial to protect the intellectual\nproperty of the pre-trained encoder by applying conventional watermarking\nmethods. To deal with this problem, in this paper, we introduce AWEncoder, an\nadversarial method for watermarking the pre-trained encoder in contrastive\nlearning. First, as an adversarial perturbation, the watermark is generated by\nenforcing the training samples to be marked to deviate respective location and\nsurround a randomly selected key image in the embedding space. Then, the\nwatermark is embedded into the pre-trained encoder by further optimizing a\njoint loss function. As a result, the watermarked encoder not only performs\nvery well for downstream tasks, but also enables us to verify its ownership by\nanalyzing the discrepancy of output provided using the encoder as the backbone\nunder both white-box and black-box conditions.

In this study, we propose a novel corruption method\nbased on the abutting grating illusion, which is a visual phenomenon widely\ndiscovered in both human and a wide range of animal species. The corruption\nmethod destroys the gradient-defined boundaries and generates the perception of\nillusory contours using line gratings abutting each other.

    "title": "Sampling Based On Natural Image Statistics Improves Local Surrogate  Explainers",
    "abstract": "Many problems in computer vision have recently been tackled using models\nwhose predictions cannot be easily interpreted, most commonly deep neural\nnetworks. Surrogate explainers are a popular post-hoc interpretability method\nto further understand how a model arrives at a particular prediction. By\ntraining a simple, more interpretable model to locally approximate the decision\nboundary of a non-interpretable system, we can estimate the relative importance\nof the input features on the prediction. Focusing on images, surrogate\nexplainers, e.g., LIME, generate a local neighbourhood around a query image by\nsampling in an interpretable domain. However, these interpretable domains have\ntraditionally been derived exclusively from the intrinsic features of the query\nimage, not taking into consideration the manifold of the data the\nnon-interpretable model has been exposed to in training (or more generally, the\nmanifold of real images). This leads to suboptimal surrogates trained on\npotentially low probability images. We address this limitation by aligning the\nlocal neighbourhood on which the surrogate is trained with the original\ntraining data distribution, even when this distribution is not accessible. We\npropose two approaches to do so, namely (1) altering the method for sampling\nthe local neighbourhood and (2) using perceptual metrics to convey some of the\nproperties of the distribution of natural images.",

Existing methods often address the problem from one perspective.\nDiverse items and complex bin scenes require diverse picking strategies\ntogether with advanced reasoning. As such, to build robust and effective\nmachine-learning algorithms for solving this complex task requires significant\namounts of comprehensive and high quality data. Collecting such data in real\nworld would be too expensive and time prohibitive and therefore intractable\nfrom a scalability perspective. To tackle this big, diverse data problem, we\ntake inspiration from the recent rise in the concept of metaverses, and\nintroduce MetaGraspNet, a large-scale photo-realistic bin picking dataset\nconstructed via physics-based metaverse synthesis. The proposed dataset\ncontains 217k RGBD images across 82 different article types, with full\nannotations for object detection, amodal perception, keypoint detection,\nmanipulation order and ambidextrous grasp labels for a parallel-jaw and vacuum\ngripper. We also provide a real dataset consisting of over 2.3k fully annotated\nhigh-quality RGBD images, divided into 5 levels of difficulties and an unseen\nobject set to evaluate different object and layout properties.

The workspace is proven to be topologically a simply-connected\nsubset and geometrically a convex subset of the set of all configurations.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate an intelligent reflecting surface\n(IRS)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system design in a\nclutter environment. Assisted by an IRS equipped with a uniform linear array\n(ULA), a multi-antenna base station (BS) is targeted for communicating with\nmultiple communication users (CUs) and sensing multiple targets simultaneously.\nWe consider the IRS-assisted ISAC design in the case with Type-I or Type-II\nCUs, where each Type-I and Type-II CU can and cannot cancel the interference\nfrom sensing signals, respectively. In particular, we aim to maximize the\nminimum sensing beampattern gain among multiple targets, by jointly optimizing\nthe BS transmit beamforming vectors and the IRS phase shifting matrix, subject\nto the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for each\nType-I/Type-II CU, the interference power constraint per clutter, the\ntransmission power constraint at the BS, and the cross-correlation pattern\nconstraint. Due to the coupling of the BS's transmit design variables and the\nIRS's phase shifting matrix, the formulated max-min IRS-assisted ISAC design\nproblem in the case with Type-I/Type-II CUs is highly non-convex. As such, we\npropose an efficient algorithm based on the alternating-optimization and\nsemi-definite relaxation (SDR) techniques. In the case with Type-I CUs, we show\nthat the dedicated sensing signal at the BS is always beneficial to improve the\nsensing performance. By contrast, the dedicated sensing signal at the BS is not\nrequired in the case with Type-II CUs.

    "abstract": "Drones equipped with cameras can significantly enhance human ability to\nperceive the world because of their remarkable maneuverability in 3D space.\nIronically, object detection for drones has always been conducted in the 2D\nimage space, which fundamentally limits their ability to understand 3D scenes.\nFurthermore, existing 3D object detection methods developed for autonomous\ndriving cannot be directly applied to drones due to the lack of deformation\nmodeling, which is essential for the distant aerial perspective with sensitive\ndistortion and small objects. To fill the gap, this work proposes a dual-view\ndetection system named DVDET to achieve aerial monocular object detection in\nboth the 2D image space and the 3D physical space. To address the severe view\ndeformation issue, we propose a novel trainable geo-deformable transformation\nmodule that can properly warp information from the drone's perspective to the\nBEV. Compared to the monocular methods for cars, our transformation includes a\nlearnable deformable network for explicitly revising the severe deviation.

We propose a new family of\nAutomatic-Repeat-Requests (ARQs) based cooperative strategies wherein high\nend-to-end reliability is obtained using packet re-transmissions at each hop\nwhile the low-latency constraint is met by imposing an upper bound on the total\nnumber of packet retransmissions across the network. A hallmark of our\nstrategies is the one-hop listening capability wherein nodes utilize the unused\nARQs of their preceding node just by counting the number of failed attempts due\nto decoding errors. We further extend the idea of one-hop listening to\nmulti-hop listening, wherein a set of consecutive nodes form clusters to\nutilize the unused ARQs of the preceding nodes, beyond its nearest neighbour,\nto further improve reliability. Thus, our strategies provide the\nhigh-reliability feature with no compromise in the original latency-constraint.\nFor the proposed strategies, we solve non-linear optimization problems on\ndistributing the ARQs across the nodes so as to minimize packet drop\nprobability (PDP) subject to a total number of ARQs in the network. Through\nextensive theoretical results on PDP and delay profiles, we show that the\nproposed strategies outperform the best-known strategies in this space.",

    "abstract": "Despite the extreme error-correction performance, the amount of computation\nof sequential decoding of the polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes\nis random. In sequential decoding of convolutional codes, the computational\ncutoff rate denotes the region between rates whose average computational\ncomplexity of decoding is finite and those which is infinite. In this paper, by\nbenefiting from the polarization and guessing techniques, we prove that the\ncomputational cutoff rate in sequential decoding of pre-transformed polar codes\npolarizes. The polarization of the computational cutoff rate affects the\ncriteria for the rate-profile construction of the pre-transformed polar codes.\nWe propose a technique for taming the Reed-Muller (RM) rate-profile\nconstruction, and the performance results demonstrate that the error-correction\nperformance of the PAC codes can achieve the theoretical bounds using the\ntamed-RM rate-profile construction and requires a significantly lower\ncomputational complexity than the RM rate-profile construction.",

    "abstract": "The online assignment problem plays an important role in operational research\nand computer science which is why immense attention has been given to improving\nits solution quality. Due to the incomplete information about the input, it is\ndifficult for online algorithms to produce the optimal solution. The quality of\nthe solution of an online algorithm is measured using a competitive ratio. No\nonline deterministic algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio better than\n(2n-1). It has been shown that advice in online computation improves the lower\nbound of the competitive ratio of online problems. Advice in online computation\ncan be interpreted as additional information for the online algorithm to\ncompensate for the lack of information about the whole input sequence. In this\nstudy, we investigate how introducing machine-learned advice could improve the\ncompetitive ratio for this problem. We provide an online algorithm for the\nonline assignment problem by simulating a machine learning algorithm that\npredicts the whole input in advance. We utilize an optimal offline algorithm to\nprovide a matching solution from the predicted input. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate how the prediction error of machine learning affects the\ncompetitive ratio of the online algorithm. We utilize a benchmark data set to\nperform our empirical analysis. We show that as the Machine Learning prediction\nerror increases, the solution quality decreases. Moreover, the magnitude of\nerror is directly proportional to the size of the input.

    "abstract": "Inspired by several delay-bounded mission-critical applications, this paper\ninvestigates chase-combining-based hybrid automatic repeat request (CC-HARQ)\nprotocols to achieve high reliability in delay-constrained applications. A\nsalient feature of our approach is to use the end-to-end delay constraint for\ncomputing the total number of ARQs permitted in the network, and then optimally\ndistributing them across the nodes so as to minimize packet-drop-probability\n(PDP), which is the end-to-end reliability metric of interest. Since the\nchase-combining strategy combines the received packets across multiple\nattempts, we observe that the PDP of the network depends on the coherence-time\nof the intermediate wireless channels. As a result, we address the question of\ncomputing optimal allocation of ARQs for CC-HARQ strategies under both\nslow-fading and fast-fading scenarios. For both the channel conditions, we\nderive closed-form expressions for the PDP, and then formulate several\noptimization problems for minimizing the PDP for a given delay-bound. Using\nextensive theoretical results on the local minima of the optimization problems,\nwe synthesize low-complexity algorithms to obtain near-optimal ARQ\ndistributions. Besides using extensive simulation results to validate our\nfindings, a detailed end-to-end delay analysis is also presented to show that\nthe proposed CC-HARQ strategies outperform already known Type-1 ARQ based\nstrategies in several scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation predicts users' next behaviors with their\nhistorical interactions. Recommending with longer sequences improves\nrecommendation accuracy and increases the degree of personalization. As\nsequences get longer, existing works have not yet addressed the following two\nmain challenges. Firstly, modeling long-range intra-sequence dependency is\ndifficult with increasing sequence lengths. Secondly, it requires efficient\nmemory and computational speeds. In this paper, we propose a Sparse Attentive\nMemory (SAM) network for long sequential user behavior modeling. SAM supports\nefficient training and real-time inference for user behavior sequences with\nlengths on the scale of thousands. In SAM, we model the target item as the\nquery and the long sequence as the knowledge database, where the former\ncontinuously elicits relevant information from the latter. SAM simultaneously\nmodels target-sequence dependencies and long-range intra-sequence dependencies\nwith O(L) complexity and O(1) number of sequential updates, which can only be\nachieved by the self-attention mechanism with O(L^2) complexity. Extensive\nempirical results demonstrate that our proposed solution is effective not only\nin long user behavior modeling but also on short sequences modeling.\nImplemented on sequences of length 1000, SAM is successfully deployed on one of\nthe largest international E-commerce platforms. This inference time is within\n30ms, with a substantial 7.30% click-through rate improvement for the online\nA/B test. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first end-to-end long user\nsequence modeling framework that models intra-sequence and target-sequence\ndependencies with the aforementioned degree of efficiency and successfully\ndeployed on a large-scale real-time industrial recommender system.",

    "abstract": "Non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion remains an interesting but\nchallenging speech processing task. Recently, AutoVC, a conditional autoencoder\nbased method, achieved excellent conversion results by disentangling the\nspeaker identity and the speech content using information-constraining\nbottlenecks. However, due to the pure autoencoder training method, it is\ndifficult to evaluate the separation effect of content and speaker identity. In\nthis paper, a novel voice conversion framework, named $\\boldsymbol T$ext\n$\\boldsymbol G$uided $\\boldsymbol A$utoVC(TGAVC), is proposed to more\neffectively separate content and timbre from speech, where an expected content\nembedding produced based on the text transcriptions is designed to guide the\nextraction of voice content. In addition, the adversarial training is applied\nto eliminate the speaker identity information in the estimated content\nembedding extracted from speech. Under the guidance of the expected content\nembedding and the adversarial training, the content encoder is trained to\nextract speaker-independent content embedding from speech. Experiments on\nAIShell-3 dataset show that the proposed model outperforms AutoVC in terms of\nnaturalness and similarity of converted speech.",

    "abstract": "Automatic face recognition is a research area with high popularity. Many\ndifferent face recognition algorithms have been proposed in the last thirty\nyears of intensive research in the field. With the popularity of deep learning\nand its capability to solve a huge variety of different problems, face\nrecognition researchers have concentrated effort on creating better models\nunder this paradigm. From the year 2015, state-of-the-art face recognition has\nbeen rooted in deep learning models. Despite the availability of large-scale\nand diverse datasets for evaluating the performance of face recognition\nalgorithms, many of the modern datasets just combine different factors that\ninfluence face recognition, such as face pose, occlusion, illumination, facial\nexpression and image quality. When algorithms produce errors on these datasets,\nit is not clear which of the factors has caused this error and, hence, there is\nno guidance in which direction more research is required. This work is a\nfollowup from our previous works developed in 2014 and eventually published in\n2016, showing the impact of various facial aspects on face recognition\nalgorithms. By comparing the current state-of-the-art with the best systems\nfrom the past, we demonstrate that faces under strong occlusions, some types of\nillumination, and strong expressions are problems mastered by deep learning\nalgorithms, whereas recognition with low-resolution images, extreme pose\nvariations, and open-set recognition is still an open problem.

    "abstract": "Relevance judgment of human assessors is inherently subjective and dynamic\nwhen evaluation datasets are created for Information Retrieval (IR) systems.\nHowever, a small group of experts' relevance judgment results are usually taken\nas ground truth to \"objectively\" evaluate the performance of the IR systems.\nRecent trends intend to employ a group of judges, such as outsourcing, to\nalleviate the potentially biased judgment results stemmed from using only a\nsingle expert's judgment. Nevertheless, different judges may have different\nopinions and may not agree with each other, and the inconsistency in human\nrelevance judgment may affect the IR system evaluation results. In this\nresearch, we introduce a Relevance Judgment Convergence Degree (RJCD) to\nmeasure the quality of queries in the evaluation datasets.

    "abstract": "Most of the currently existing vision and language pre-training (VLP) methods\nhave mainly focused on how to extract and align vision and text features. In\ncontrast to the mainstream VLP methods, we highlight that two routinely applied\nsteps during pre-training have crucial impact on the performance of the\npre-trained model: in-batch hard negative sampling for image-text matching\n(ITM) and assigning the large masking probability for the masked language\nmodeling (MLM). After empirically showing the unexpected effectiveness of above\ntwo steps, we systematically devise our GRIT-VLP, which adaptively samples\nmini-batches for more effective mining of hard negative samples for ITM while\nmaintaining the computational cost for pre-training. Our method consists of\nthree components: 1) GRouped mIni-baTch sampling (GRIT) strategy that collects\nsimilar examples in a mini-batch, 2) ITC consistency loss for improving the\nmining ability, and 3) enlarged masking probability for MLM. Consequently, we\nshow our GRIT-VLP achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on various\ndownstream tasks with much less computational cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat our model is essentially in par with ALBEF, the previous state-of-the-art,\nonly with one-third of training epochs on the same training data.

    "abstract": "There is often a scarcity of training data for machine learning (ML)\nclassification and regression models in industrial production, especially for\ntime-consuming or sparsely run manufacturing processes. A majority of the\nlimited ground-truth data is used for training, while a handful of samples are\nleft for testing. Here, the number of test samples is inadequate to properly\nevaluate the robustness of the ML models under test for classification and\nregression. Furthermore, the output of these ML models may be inaccurate or\neven fail if the input data differ from the expected. This is the case for ML\nmodels used in the Electroslag Remelting (ESR) process in the refined steel\nindustry to predict the pressure in a vacuum chamber. A vacuum pumping event\nthat occurs once a workday generates a few hundred samples in a year of pumping\nfor training and testing. In the absence of adequate training and test samples,\nthis paper first presents a method to generate a fresh set of augmented samples\nbased on vacuum pumping principles. Based on the generated augmented samples,\nthree test scenarios and one test oracle are presented to assess the robustness\nof an ML model used for production on an industrial scale. Experiments are\nconducted with real industrial production data obtained from Uddeholms AB steel\ncompany. The evaluations indicate that Ensemble and Neural Network are the most\nrobust when trained on augmented data using the proposed testing strategy. The\nevaluation also demonstrates the proposed method's effectiveness in checking\nand improving ML algorithms' robustness in such situations. The work improves\nsoftware testing's state-of-the-art robustness testing in similar settings.\nFinally, the paper presents an MLOps implementation of the proposed approach\nfor real-time ML model prediction and action on the edge node and automated\ncontinuous delivery of ML software from the cloud.",

These forks create variants, which have a common code base\nbut then evolve the code in different directions, which is specific to that\nforked project requirements. An interesting side-effect of having multiple\nforks is the ability to select between different evolution directions of the\ncode which is based on developers fixing bugs in the code base. However, the\nkey issue that this decentralized form of information is difficult to analyze.\nIn this study, we propose a visualization to analyze active changes in fork\nrepositories that have not been merged back to the original project. Our\nvisualization shows code commit activities in multiple forks with highlight on\nbug fix commits in the history of forks. While the commit activity of each\nrepository is visualized similarly to the code frequency view of GitHub, our\nview shows only commits unique to fork repositories. To illustrate the\neffectiveness of our visualization, we have applied our view to two use cases:\nidentifying forks from a repository no longer maintained, and identifying a bug\nfix among forks. In the first case, we identify a fork of a suspended project\nnamed Obfuscator-LLVM. Our view shows the original repository and its most\nactive fork that continue the development on the top. In the second case, we\nidentify a bug fix in a fork of Clipy project. Our view shows that the most\nactive fork has its own bug fixes; we could easily identify a patch for the bug\nhighlighted in the view. As a new ideas paper, we then present our outline of\nthree research questions to spark real world use-cases and goals for our\nvisualization has the potential to uncover.

    "abstract": "The pairwise objective paradigms are an important and essential aspect of\nmachine learning. Examples of machine learning approaches that use pairwise\nobjective functions include differential network in face recognition, metric\nlearning, bipartite learning, multiple kernel learning, and maximizing of area\nunder the curve (AUC). Compared to pointwise learning, pairwise learning's\nsample size grows quadratically with the number of samples and thus its\ncomplexity. Researchers mostly address this challenge by utilizing an online\nlearning system. Recent research has, however, offered adaptive sample size\ntraining for smooth loss functions as a better strategy in terms of convergence\nand complexity, but without a comprehensive theoretical study. In a distinct\nline of research, importance sampling has sparked a considerable amount of\ninterest in finite pointwise-sum minimization. This is because of the\nstochastic gradient variance, which causes the convergence to be slowed\nconsiderably. In this paper, we combine adaptive sample size and importance\nsampling techniques for pairwise learning, with convergence guarantees for\nnonsmooth convex pairwise loss functions. In particular, the model is trained\nstochastically using an expanded training set for a predefined number of\niterations derived from the stability bounds. In addition, we demonstrate that\nsampling opposite instances at each iteration reduces the variance of the\ngradient, hence accelerating convergence. Experiments on a broad variety of\ndatasets in AUC maximization confirm the theoretical results.",

We pay less attention to affective intents--those that seek to\ninfluence or leverage the audience's opinions, attitudes, or values in some\nway. Affective objectives may range in outcomes from making the viewer care\nabout the subject, strengthening a stance on an opinion, or leading them to\ntake further action. Because such goals are often considered a violation of\nperceived 'neutrality' or are 'political,' designers may resist or be unable to\ndescribe these intents, let alone formalize them as learning objectives. While\nthere are notable exceptions--such as advocacy visualizations or persuasive\ncartography--we find that visualization designers rarely acknowledge or\nformalize affective objectives. Through interviews with visualization\ndesigners, we expand on prior work on using learning objectives as a framework\nfor describing and assessing communicative intent. Specifically, we extend and\nrevise the framework to include a set of affective learning objectives. This\nstructured taxonomy can help designers identify and declare their goals and\ncompare and assess designs in a more principled way.

However,\nexisting related datasets mostly focused on users' field of view (FoV),\nignoring the more important eye gaze information, not to mention the integrated\nextraction and analysis of both FoV and eye gaze. Besides, users' behavior\npatterns are highly related to videos, yet most existing datasets only\ncontained videos with subjective and qualitative classification from video\ngenres, which lack quantitative analysis and fail to characterize the intrinsic\nproperties of a video scene. To this end, we first propose a quantitative\ntaxonomy for 360{\\deg} videos that contains three objective technical metrics.\nBased on this taxonomy, we collect a dataset containing users' head and gaze\nbehaviors simultaneously, which outperforms existing datasets with rich\ndimensions, large scale, strong diversity, and high frequency.

Most existing works explore the semantic encoding and transmission\nfor text and apply techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret\nthe meaning of the text. In this paper, we conceive the semantic communications\nfor image data that is much more richer in semantics and bandwidth sensitive.\nWe propose an reinforcement learning based adaptive semantic coding (RL-ASC)\napproach that encodes images beyond pixel level. Firstly, we define the\nsemantic concept of image data that includes the category, spatial arrangement,\nand visual feature as the representation unit, and propose a convolutional\nsemantic encoder to extract semantic concepts. Secondly, we propose the image\nreconstruction criterion that evolves from the traditional pixel similarity to\nsemantic similarity and perceptual performance. Thirdly, we design a novel\nRL-based semantic bit allocation model, whose reward is the increase in\nrate-semantic-perceptual performance after encoding a certain semantic concept\nwith adaptive quantization level. Thus, the task-related information is\npreserved and reconstructed properly while less important data is discarded.\nFinally, we propose the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) based semantic\ndecoder that fuses both locally and globally features via an attention module.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-ASC is noise robust and\ncould reconstruct visually pleasant and semantic consistent image, and saves\ntimes of bit cost compared to standard codecs and other deep learning-based\nimage codecs.",

However, a good test suite must\nhave different properties, which cannot be captured by using an individual\ncoverage criterion. Therefore, the state-of-the-art approach combines multiple\ncriteria to generate test cases. As combining multiple coverage criteria brings\nmultiple objectives for optimization, it hurts the test suites' coverage for\ncertain criteria compared with using the single criterion. To cope with this\nproblem, we propose a novel approach named \\textbf{smart selection}. Based on\nthe coverage correlations among criteria and the coverage goals' subsumption\nrelationships, smart selection selects a subset of coverage goals to reduce the\nnumber of optimization objectives and avoid missing any properties of all\ncriteria.

In this work, we present an end-to-end political\nideology pipeline, which includes; a domain-independent ground truth based on\nthe slant of media users' share, a socially-informed lense allowing performant\nideology inference, and an appropriate classifier methodology. We apply the\npipeline to both the conventional use case of left-right ideology detection,\nand the detection of far-right users (who are often of more concern). The\nideology detection pipeline can be applied directly to investigate communities\nof interest, and sets a strong footing for a plethora of downstream tasks.",

    "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems (CRS) that interact with users in natural\nlanguage utilize recommendation dialogs collected with the help of paired\nhumans, where one plays the role of a seeker and the other as a recommender.\nThese recommendation dialogs include items and entities to disclose seekers'\npreferences in natural language. However, in order to precisely model the\nseekers' preferences and respond consistently, mainly CRS rely on explicitly\nannotated items and entities that appear in the dialog, and usually leverage\nthe domain knowledge. In this work, we investigate INSPIRED, a dataset\nconsisting of recommendation dialogs for the sociable conversational\nrecommendation, where items and entities were explicitly annotated using\nautomatic keyword or pattern matching techniques. To this end, we found a large\nnumber of cases where items and entities were either wrongly annotated or\nmissing annotations at all. The question however remains to what extent\nautomatic techniques for annotations are effective. Moreover, it is unclear\nwhat is the relative impact of poor and improved annotations on the overall\neffectiveness of a CRS in terms of the consistency and quality of responses. In\nthis regard, first, we manually fixed the annotations and removed the noise in\nthe INSPIRED dataset. Second, we evaluate the performance of several benchmark\nCRS using both versions of the dataset. Our analyses suggest that with the\nimproved version of the dataset, i.e., INSPIRED2, various benchmark CRS\noutperformed and that dialogs are rich in knowledge concepts compared to when\nthe original version is used.

The problem contains the parameters $\\epsilon$ and $\\mu$\nmultiplying the diffusion and convection coefficients, respectively.

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation models are primarily optimized to distinguish\npositive samples from negative ones during training in which negative sampling\nserves as an essential component in learning the evolving user preferences\nthrough historical records. Except for randomly sampling negative samples from\na uniformly distributed subset, many delicate methods have been proposed to\nmine negative samples with high quality. However, due to the inherent\nrandomness of negative sampling, false negative samples are inevitably\ncollected in model training. Current strategies mainly focus on removing such\nfalse negative samples, which leads to overlooking potential user interests,\nlack of recommendation diversity, less model robustness, and suffering from\nexposure bias. To this end, we propose a novel method that can Utilize False\nNegative samples for sequential Recommendation (UFNRec) to improve model\nperformance. We first devise a simple strategy to extract false negative\nsamples and then transfer these samples to positive samples in the following\ntraining process. Furthermore, we construct a teacher model to provide soft\nlabels for false negative samples and design a consistency loss to regularize\nthe predictions of these samples from the student model and the teacher model.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize false negative\nsamples instead of simply removing them for the sequential recommendation.\nExperiments on three benchmark public datasets are conducted using three widely\napplied SOTA models. The experiment results demonstrate that our proposed\nUFNRec can effectively draw information from false negative samples and further\nimprove the performance of SOTA models.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a novel perspective to the problem of patch\ncorrectness assessment: a correct patch implements changes that \"answer\" to a\nproblem posed by buggy behaviour. Concretely, we turn the patch correctness\nassessment into a Question Answering problem. To tackle this problem, our\nintuition is that natural language processing can provide the necessary\nrepresentations and models for assessing the semantic correlation between a bug\n(question) and a patch (answer). Specifically, we consider as inputs the bug\nreports as well as the natural language description of the generated patches.\nOur approach, Quatrain, first considers state of the art commit message\ngeneration models to produce the relevant inputs associated to each generated\npatch. Then we leverage a neural network architecture to learn the semantic\ncorrelation between bug reports and commit messages. Experiments on a large\ndataset of 9135 patches generated for three bug datasets (Defects4j, Bugs.jar\nand Bears) show that Quatrain can achieve an AUC of 0.886 on predicting patch\ncorrectness, and recalling 93% correct patches while filtering out 62%\nincorrect patches. Our experimental results further demonstrate the influence\nof inputs quality on prediction performance. We further perform experiments to\nhighlight that the model indeed learns the relationship between bug reports and\ncode change descriptions for the prediction. Finally, we compare against prior\nwork and discuss the benefits of our approach.",

Universal Generating Function (UGF) is an important method in\nthe reliability analysis, which efficiently obtains the system reliability by a\nfast algebraic procedure. However, when structural relationships between\nsubsystems or components are not clear or without explicit expressions, the UGF\nmethod is difficult to use or not applicable at all. Bayesian Network (BN) has\na natural advantage in terms of uncertainty inference for the relationship\nwithout explicit expressions. For the number of components is extremely large,\nthough, it has the defects of low efficiency. To overcome the respective\ndefects of UGF and BN, a novel reliability analysis method called UGF-BN is\nproposed for the complex MSS. In the UGF-BN framework, the UGF method is\nfirstly used to analyze the bottom components with a large number. Then\nprobability distributions obtained are taken as the input of BN. Finally, the\nreliability of the complex MSS is modeled by the BN method.

However, as a reconstruction-based\nframework, it is still an open question to understand how MIM works, since MIM\nappears very different from previous well-studied siamese approaches such as\ncontrastive learning. In this paper, we propose a new viewpoint: MIM implicitly\nlearns occlusion-invariant features, which is analogous to other siamese\nmethods while the latter learns other invariance. By relaxing MIM formulation\ninto an equivalent siamese form, MIM methods can be interpreted in a unified\nframework with conventional methods, among which only a) data transformations,\ni.e. what invariance to learn, and b) similarity measurements are different.\nFurthermore, taking MAE (He et al.) as a representative example of MIM, we\nempirically find the success of MIM models relates a little to the choice of\nsimilarity functions, but the learned occlusion invariant feature introduced by\nmasked image -- it turns out to be a favored initialization for vision\ntransformers, even though the learned feature could be less semantic.

The large majority of\nlearning approaches applied today rely either on static representations or on\nshort-term temporal correlations. This is at odds with the nature of brain\nactivity which is dynamic and exhibit both short- and long-range dependencies.\nFurther, new sophisticated deep learning approaches have been developed and\nvalidated on single tasks/datasets. The application of these models for the\nstudy of a different targets typically require exhaustive hyperparameter\nsearch, model engineering and trial and error to obtain competitive results\nwith simpler linear models.

Subsequently, a state-of-the-art\nconvolutional neural network, YOLOv4, is trained to detect the different types\nof industrial objects.

    "abstract": "Activation compressed training~(ACT) has been shown to be a promising way to\nreduce the memory consumption in training deep neural networks. However,\nexisting work of ACT relies on searching for the optimal bit-width during deep\nneural network (DNN) training to reduce the quantization noise, which makes the\nprocedure complicated and less transparent. To this end, we propose a simple\nand effective ACT method for DNN training. Our method is motivated by the\nobservation: \\emph{DNN backward propagation mainly depends on the low-frequency\ncomponent~(LFC) of the activation maps instead of the high-frequency\ncomponent~(HFC)}. It indicates the HFC of the activation maps is highly\nredundant and compressible during DNN training, which inspires our proposed\nDual ActIVation PrecISION~(DIVISION). During the training, DIVISION estimates\nboth the LFC and HFC of the activation maps, and compresses the HFC into\nlow-precision copy to remove the redundancy. This can significantly reduce the\nmemory consumption without negatively affecting the precision of DNN backward\npropagation. In this way, DIVISION achieves comparable performance as normal\ntraining.

Currently, there are no well-developed institutional collaboration\nrecommendation systems.

The framework, based on NLP\nand network analysis techniques, is capable of determining the strengths of an\ninstitution in different thematic areas within a field and thereby determining\nthe core competency and potential core competency areas of that institution. A\nmajor advantage of the system is that it can help to determine and improve the\nresearch portfolio of an institution within a field through suitable\ncollaboration, which may lead to the overall improvement of the performance of\nthe institution in that field. The framework is demonstrated by analyzing the\nperformance of 195 Indian institutions in the field of 'Computer Science'.

We\nutilize the extracted feature maps from the Siamese architecture as local\ndescriptors, the search results are then further refined using a cosine\nsimilarity between local descriptors. We conduct a deeper analysis of the\nGoogle Landmark Dataset, which is used for evaluation, and augment the dataset\nto handle various intra-class variances. Furthermore, we conduct several\nexperiments to compare the effects of transfer learning and metric learning, as\nwell as experiments using other local descriptors. We show that a re-ranking\nusing local features can improve the search results. We believe that the\nproposed local feature extraction using cosine similarity is a simple approach\nthat can be extended to many other retrieval tasks.",

    "abstract": "We present Bit Diffusion: a simple and generic approach for generating\ndiscrete data with continuous diffusion models. The main idea behind our\napproach is to first represent the discrete data as binary bits, and then train\na continuous diffusion model to model these bits as real numbers which we call\nanalog bits. To generate samples, the model first generates the analog bits,\nwhich are then thresholded to obtain the bits that represent the discrete\nvariables. We further propose two simple techniques, namely Self-Conditioning\nand Asymmetric Time Intervals, which lead to a significant improvement in\nsample quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can achieve\nstrong performance in both discrete image generation and image captioning\ntasks. For discrete image generation, we significantly improve previous\nstate-of-the-art on both CIFAR-10 (which has 3K discrete 8-bit tokens) and\nImageNet-64x64 (which has 12K discrete 8-bit tokens), outperforming the best\nautoregressive model in both sample quality (measured by FID) and efficiency.\nFor image captioning on MS-COCO dataset, our approach achieves competitive\nresults compared to autoregressive models.",

In particular,\nseveral deep learning systems have been introduced to enable comprehensive\nanalysis of neuro-developmental conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder\n(ASD). This condition affects children from their early developmental stages\nonwards, and diagnosis relies entirely on observing the child's behavior and\ndetecting behavioral cues. However, the diagnosis process is time-consuming as\nit requires long-term behavior observation, and the scarce availability of\nspecialists. We demonstrate the effect of a region-based computer vision system\nto help clinicians and parents analyze a child's behavior. For this purpose, we\nadopt and enhance a dataset for analyzing autism-related actions using videos\nof children captured in uncontrolled environments (e.g. videos collected with\nconsumer-grade cameras, in varied environments). The data is pre-processed by\ndetecting the target child in the video to reduce the impact of background\nnoise. Motivated by the effectiveness of temporal convolutional models, we\npropose both light-weight and conventional models capable of extracting action\nfeatures from video frames and classifying autism-related behaviors by\nanalyzing the relationships between frames in a video. Through extensive\nevaluations on the feature extraction and learning strategies, we demonstrate\nthat the best performance is achieved with an Inflated 3D Convnet and\nMulti-Stage Temporal Convolutional Networks, achieving a 0.83 Weighted F1-score\nfor classification of the three autism-related actions, outperforming existing\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Video-text retrieval (VTR) is an attractive yet challenging task for\nmulti-modal understanding, which aims to search for relevant video (text) given\na query (video). Existing methods typically employ completely heterogeneous\nvisual-textual information to align video and text, whilst lacking the\nawareness of homogeneous high-level semantic information residing in both\nmodalities. To fill this gap, in this work, we propose a novel\nvisual-linguistic aligning model named HiSE for VTR, which improves the\ncross-modal representation by incorporating explicit high-level semantics.\nFirst, we explore the hierarchical property of explicit high-level semantics,\nand further decompose it into two levels, i.e. discrete semantics and holistic\nsemantics. Specifically, for visual branch, we exploit an off-the-shelf\nsemantic entity predictor to generate discrete high-level semantics. In\nparallel, a trained video captioning model is employed to output holistic\nhigh-level semantics. As for the textual modality, we parse the text into three\nparts including occurrence, action and entity. In particular, the occurrence\ncorresponds to the holistic high-level semantics, meanwhile both action and\nentity represent the discrete ones. Then, different graph reasoning techniques\nare utilized to promote the interaction between holistic and discrete\nhigh-level semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with the aid of\nexplicit high-level semantics, our method achieves the superior performance\nover state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets, including MSR-VTT,\nMSVD and DiDeMo.",

The formulation leverages\nconcepts from information-theoretic signal compression, specifically, the\ninformation bottleneck (IB) method, to pose an abstraction problem as an\noptimal encoder search over the space of multi-resolution trees. The\nabstractions emerge in a task-relevant manner as a function of agent\ninformation-processing constraints.

A\ndiscussion delineating the benefits and drawbacks of our formulation is\npresented, as well as a detailed explanation how our approach can be\ninterpreted within the context of generating abstractions for\nresource-constrained autonomous systems. It is shown that the resulting\ninformation-theoretic abstraction problem over the space of multi-resolution\ntrees can be formulated as a integer linear programming (ILP) problem. We\ndemonstrate the approach on a number of examples, and provide a discussion\ndetailing the differences of the proposed framework compared to existing\nmethods.

Although powerful, it is very difficult for a\nGNN-based recommender system to attach tangible explanations of why a specific\nitem ends up in the list of suggestions for a given user. Indeed, explaining\nGNN-based recommendations is unique, and existing GNN explanation methods are\ninappropriate for two reasons. First, traditional GNN explanation methods are\ndesigned for node, edge, or graph classification tasks rather than ranking, as\nin recommender systems. Second, standard machine learning explanations are\nusually intended to support skilled decision-makers. Instead, recommendations\nare designed for any end-user, and thus their explanations should be provided\nin user-understandable ways. In this work, we propose GREASE, a novel method\nfor explaining the suggestions provided by any black-box GNN-based recommender\nsystem. Specifically, GREASE first trains a surrogate model on a target\nuser-item pair and its $l$-hop neighborhood. Then, it generates both factual\nand counterfactual explanations by finding optimal adjacency matrix\nperturbations to capture the sufficient and necessary conditions for an item to\nbe recommended, respectively.

These images can be utilized to train an\ninvariant classifier, avoiding the wide spread problem of deep architectures\nlearning spurious correlations rather than meaningful ones. As a consequence,\nout-of-domain robustness is improved. However, the CGN architecture comprises\nmultiple over parameterized networks, namely BigGAN and U2-Net. Training these\nnetworks requires appropriate background knowledge and extensive computation.\nSince one does not always have access to the precise training details, nor do\nthey always possess the necessary knowledge of counterfactuals, our work\naddresses the following question: Can we use the knowledge embedded in\npre-trained CGNs to train a lower-capacity model, assuming black-box access\n(i.e., only access to the pretrained CGN model) to the components of the\narchitecture? In this direction, we propose a novel work named SKDCGN that\nattempts knowledge transfer using Knowledge Distillation (KD). In our proposed\narchitecture, each independent mechanism (shape, texture, background) is\nrepresented by a student 'TinyGAN' that learns from the pretrained teacher\n'BigGAN'. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method using\nstate-of-the-art datasets such as ImageNet, and MNIST by using KD and\nappropriate loss functions. Moreover, as an additional contribution, our paper\nconducts a thorough study on the composition mechanism of the CGNs, to gain a\nbetter understanding of how each mechanism influences the classification\naccuracy of an invariant classifier.

In\nthis work, we design and analyze a novel Reconfigurable power-efficient and\ncongestion-aware Silicon Photonic 2.5D Interposer network, called ReSiPI.\nConsidering run-time traffic, ReSiPI is able to dynamically deploy\ninter-chiplet photonic gateways to improve the overall network congestion.\nReSiPI also employs switching elements based on phase change materials (PCMs)\nto dynamically reconfigure and power-gate the photonic interposer network,\nthereby improving the network power efficiency. Compared to the best prior\nstate-of-the-art 2.5D photonic network, ReSiPI demonstrates, on average, 37%\nlower latency, 25% power reduction, and 53% energy minimization in the network.",

Our model encodes each\ndocument with a set of generated pseudo-queries to get query-informed,\nmulti-view document representations. It not only enjoys high inference\nefficiency like the vanilla dual-encoder models, but also enables deep\nquery-document interactions in document encoding and provides multi-faceted\nrepresentations to better match different queries. Experiments on several\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, out-performing\nstrong dual encoder baselines.The code is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/jordane95/dual-cross-encoder",

    "abstract": "The metaverse has the potential to revolutionize the next generation of the\nInternet by supporting highly interactive services with the help of Mixed\nReality (MR) technologies; still, to provide a satisfactory experience for\nusers, the synchronization between the physical world and its digital models is\ncrucial. This work proposes a sampling, communication and prediction co-design\nframework to minimize the communication load subject to a constraint on\ntracking the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between a real-world device and its\ndigital model in the metaverse. To optimize the sampling rate and the\nprediction horizon, we exploit expert knowledge and develop a constrained Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm, named Knowledge-assisted Constrained\nTwin-Delayed Deep Deterministic (KC-TD3) policy gradient algorithm. We validate\nour framework on a prototype composed of a real-world robotic arm and its\ndigital model. Compared with existing approaches: (1) When the tracking error\nconstraint is stringent (MSE=0.002 degrees), our policy degenerates into the\npolicy in the sampling-communication co-design framework. (2) When the tracking\nerror constraint is mild (MSE=0.007 degrees), our policy degenerates into the\npolicy in the prediction-communication co-design framework. (3) Our framework\nachieves a better trade-off between the average MSE and the average\ncommunication load compared with a communication system without sampling and\nprediction. For example, the average communication load can be reduced up to\n87% when the track error constraint is 0.002 degrees. (4) Our policy\noutperforms the benchmark with the static sampling rate and prediction horizon\noptimized by exhaustive search, in terms of the tail probability of the\ntracking error. Furthermore, with the assistance of expert knowledge, the\nproposed algorithm KC-TD3 achieves better convergence time, stability, and\nfinal policy performance.",

Constraining the\nusage of memory in such cases is of paramount importance. It is important that\nsuch code size improvements should not have a negative impact on the runtime.\nImproving the execution time while optimizing for code size is a non-trivial\nbut a significant task. The ordering of standard optimization sequences in\nmodern compilers is fixed, and are heuristically created by the compiler domain\nexperts based on their expertise. However, this ordering is sub-optimal, and\ndoes not generalize well across all the cases. We present a reinforcement\nlearning based solution to the phase ordering problem, where the ordering\nimproves both the execution time and code size. We propose two different\napproaches to model the sequences: one by manual ordering, and other based on a\ngraph called Oz Dependence Graph (ODG). Our approach uses minimal data as\ntraining set, and is integrated with LLVM. We show results on x86 and AArch64\narchitectures on the benchmarks from SPEC-CPU 2006, SPEC-CPU 2017 and MiBench.\nWe observe that the proposed model based on ODG outperforms the current Oz\nsequence both in terms of size and execution time by 6.19% and 11.99% in SPEC\n2017 benchmarks, on an average.",

In this paper, we propose an efficient and flexible\nalgorithm generating a trajectory-independent 3D sparse topological skeleton\ngraph capturing the spatial structure of the free space. In our method, an\nefficient ray sampling and validating mechanism are adopted to find distinctive\nfree space regions, which contributes to skeleton graph vertices, with\ntraversability between adjacent vertices as edges. A cycle formation scheme is\nalso utilized to maintain skeleton graph compactness. Benchmark comparison with\nstate-of-the-art works demonstrates that our approach generates sparse graphs\nin a substantially shorter time, giving high-quality global planning paths.\nExperiments conducted in real-world maps further validate the capability of our\nmethod in real-world scenarios.

Participants are assigned to one of\ntwo treatments in which the position of the defective files is switched.

In\nthis paper, we aim to understand the developers' perspective on assessing\nsoftware security during code review, the challenges they encounter, and the\nsupport that companies and projects provide. To this end, we conduct a two-step\ninvestigation: we interview 10 professional developers and survey 182\npractitioners about software security assessment during code review. The\noutcome is an overview of how developers perceive software security during code\nreview and a set of identified challenges. Our study revealed that most\ndevelopers do not immediately report to focus on security issues during code\nreview. Only after being asked about software security, developers state to\nalways consider it during review and acknowledge its importance. Most companies\ndo not provide security training, yet expect developers to still ensure\nsecurity during reviews. Accordingly, developers report the lack of training\nand security knowledge as the main challenges they face when checking for\nsecurity issues. In addition, they have challenges with third-party libraries\nand to identify interactions between parts of code that could have security\nimplications. Moreover, security may be disregarded during reviews due to\ndevelopers' assumptions about the security dynamic of the application they\ndevelop.\nData and materials: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6875435",

    "abstract": "Balancing multiple competing and conflicting objectives is an essential task\nfor any artificial intelligence tasked with satisfying human values or\npreferences. Conflict arises both from misalignment between individuals with\ncompeting values, but also between conflicting value systems held by a single\nhuman. Starting with principle of loss-aversion, we designed a set of soft\nmaximin function approaches to multi-objective decision-making. Bench-marking\nthese functions in a set of previously-developed environments, we found that\none new approach in particular, `split-function exp-log loss aversion'\n(SFELLA), learns faster than the state of the art thresholded alignment\nobjective method \\cite{vamplew_potential-based_2021} on three of four tasks it\nwas tested on, and achieved the same optimal performance after learning. SFELLA\nalso showed relative robustness improvements against changes in objective\nscale, which may highlight an advantage dealing with distribution shifts in the\nenvironment dynamics. Further work had to be omitted from the preprint, but in\nthe final published version, we will further compare SFELLA to the\nmulti-objective reward exponentials (MORE) approach, demonstrating that SFELLA\nperforms similarly to MORE in a simple previously-described foraging task, but\nin a modified foraging environment with a new resource that was not depleted as\nthe agent worked, SFELLA collected more of the new resource with very little\ncost incurred in terms of the old resource. Overall, we found SFELLA useful for\navoiding problems that sometimes occur with a thresholded approach, and more\nreward-responsive than MORE while retaining its conservative, loss-averse\nincentive structure.",

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) aims to produce pixel-wise\nclass predictions with only image-level labels for training. To this end,\nprevious methods adopt the common pipeline: they generate pseudo masks from\nclass activation maps (CAMs) and use such masks to supervise segmentation\nnetworks. However, it is challenging to derive comprehensive pseudo masks that\ncover the whole extent of objects due to the local property of CAMs, i.e., they\ntend to focus solely on small discriminative object parts. In this paper, we\nassociate the locality of CAMs with the texture-biased property of\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). Accordingly, we propose to exploit shape\ninformation to supplement the texture-biased CNN features, thereby encouraging\nmask predictions to be not only comprehensive but also well-aligned with object\nboundaries. We further refine the predictions in an online fashion with a novel\nrefinement method that takes into account both the class and the color\naffinities, in order to generate reliable pseudo masks to supervise the model.\nImportantly, our model is end-to-end trained within a single-stage framework\nand therefore efficient in terms of the training cost. Through extensive\nexperiments on PASCAL VOC 2012, we validate the effectiveness of our method in\nproducing precise and shape-aligned segmentation results. Specifically, our\nmodel surpasses the existing state-of-the-art single-stage approaches by large\nmargins.

In this paper, we learn to compare the image quality\nof two registered images, with respect to a chosen distortion. Our method takes\nadvantage of the fact that at times, simulating image distortion and later\nevaluating its relative image quality, is easier than assessing its absolute\nvalue. Thus, given a pair of images, we look for an optimal dimensional\nreduction function that will map each image to a numerical score, so that the\nscores will reflect the image quality relation (i.e., a less distorted image\nwill receive a lower score). We look for an optimal dimensional reduction\nmapping in the form of a Deep Neural Network which minimizes the violation of\nimage quality order. Subsequently, we extend the method to order a set of\nimages by utilizing the predicted level of the chosen distortion.

Recent works related to underwater\nimage enhancement, and based on deep learning approaches, tackle the lack of\npaired datasets generating synthetic ground-truth. In this paper, we present a\nself-supervised learning methodology for underwater image enhancement based on\ndeep learning that requires no paired datasets. The proposed method estimates\nthe degradation present in underwater images. Besides, an autoencoder\nreconstructs this image, and its output image is degraded using the estimated\ndegradation information. Therefore, the strategy replaces the output image with\nthe degraded version in the loss function during the training phase. This\nprocedure \\textit{misleads} the neural network that learns to compensate the\nadditional degradation. As a result, the reconstructed image is an enhanced\nversion of the input image. Also, the algorithm presents an attention module to\nreduce high-intensity areas generated in enhanced images by color channel\nunbalances and outlier regions.

    "abstract": "Isoforms are mRNAs produced from the same gene site in the phenomenon called\nAlternative Splicing. Studies have shown that more than 95% of human multi-exon\ngenes have undergone alternative splicing. Although there are few changes in\nmRNA sequence, They may have a systematic effect on cell function and\nregulation. It is widely reported that isoforms of a gene have distinct or even\ncontrasting functions. Most studies have shown that alternative splicing plays\na significant role in human health and disease. Despite the wide range of gene\nfunction studies, there is little information about isoforms' functionalities.\nRecently, some computational methods based on Multiple Instance Learning have\nbeen proposed to predict isoform function using gene function and gene\nexpression profile. However, their performance is not desirable due to the lack\nof labeled training data. In addition, probabilistic models such as Conditional\nRandom Field (CRF) have been used to model the relation between isoforms. This\nproject uses all the data and valuable information such as isoform sequences,\nexpression profiles, and gene ontology graphs and proposes a comprehensive\nmodel based on Deep Neural Networks. The UniProt Gene Ontology (GO) database is\nused as a standard reference for gene functions. The NCBI RefSeq database is\nused for extracting gene and isoform sequences, and the NCBI SRA database is\nused for expression profile data. Metrics such as Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) and Precision-Recall Under the\nCurve (PR AUC) are used to measure the prediction accuracy.",

However, these anomalous sounds\nof machines are usually unavailable in normal conditions. Therefore, the models\nemployed have to learn acoustic representations with normal sounds for\ntraining, and detect anomalous sounds while testing. In this article, we\npropose a self-supervised dual-path Transformer (SSDPT) network to detect\nanomalous sounds in machine monitoring. The SSDPT network splits the acoustic\nfeatures into segments and employs several DPT blocks for time and frequency\nmodeling. DPT blocks use attention modules to alternately model the interactive\ninformation about the frequency and temporal components of the segmented\nacoustic features. To address the problem of lack of anomalous sound, we adopt\na self-supervised learning approach to train the network with normal sound.\nSpecifically, this approach randomly masks and reconstructs the acoustic\nfeatures, and jointly classifies machine identity information to improve the\nperformance of anomalous sound detection. We evaluated our method on the\nDCASE2021 task2 dataset.

    "abstract": "A deep learning (DL) closure model for large-eddy simulation (LES) is\ndeveloped and evaluated for incompressible flows around a rectangular cylinder\nat moderate Reynolds numbers. Near-wall flow simulation remains a central\nchallenge in aerodynamic modeling: RANS predictions of separated flows are\noften inaccurate, while LES can require prohibitively small near-wall mesh\nsizes. The DL-LES model is trained using adjoint PDE optimization methods to\nmatch, as closely as possible, direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. It is\nthen evaluated out-of-sample (i.e., for new aspect ratios and Reynolds numbers\nnot included in the training data) and compared against a standard LES model\n(the dynamic Smagorinsky model). The DL-LES model outperforms dynamic\nSmagorinsky and is able to achieve accurate LES predictions on a relatively\ncoarse mesh (downsampled from the DNS grid by a factor of four in each\nCartesian direction). We study the accuracy of the DL-LES model for predicting\nthe drag coefficient, mean flow, and Reynolds stress. A crucial challenge is\nthat the LES quantities of interest are the steady-state flow statistics; for\nexample, the time-averaged mean velocity $\\bar{u}(x) = \\displaystyle \\lim_{t\n\\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{t} \\int_0^t u(s,x) dx$. Calculating the\nsteady-state flow statistics therefore requires simulating the DL-LES equations\nover a large number of flow times through the domain; it is a non-trivial\nquestion whether an unsteady partial differential equation model whose\nfunctional form is defined by a deep neural network can remain stable and\naccurate on $t \\in [0, \\infty)$. Our results demonstrate that the DL-LES model\nis accurate and stable over large physical time spans, enabling the estimation\nof the steady-state statistics for the velocity, fluctuations, and drag\ncoefficient of turbulent flows around bluff bodies relevant to aerodynamic\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Pneumonia is one of the major reasons for child mortality especially in\nincome-deprived regions of the world. Although it can be detected and treated\nwith very less sophisticated instruments and medication, Pneumonia detection\nstill remains a major concern in developing countries. Computer-aided based\ndiagnosis (CAD) systems can be used in such countries due to their lower\noperating costs than professional medical experts. In this paper, we propose a\nCAD system for Pneumonia detection from Chest X-rays, using the concepts of\ndeep learning and a meta-heuristic algorithm. We first extract deep features\nfrom the pre-trained ResNet50, fine-tuned on a target Pneumonia dataset. Then,\nwe propose a feature selection technique based on particle swarm optimization\n(PSO), which is modified using a memory-based adaptation parameter, and\nenriched by incorporating an altruistic behavior into the agents. We name our\nfeature selection method as adaptive and altruistic PSO (AAPSO). The proposed\nmethod successfully eliminates non-informative features obtained from the\nResNet50 model, thereby improving the Pneumonia detection ability of the\noverall framework. Extensive experimentation and thorough analysis on a\npublicly available Pneumonia dataset establish the superiority of the proposed\nmethod over several other frameworks used for Pneumonia detection. Apart from\nPneumonia detection, AAPSO is further evaluated on some standard UCI datasets,\ngene expression datasets for cancer prediction and a COVID-19 prediction\ndataset. The overall results are satisfactory, thereby confirming the\nusefulness of AAPSO in dealing with varied real-life problems.

    "abstract": "The Rayleigh regression model was recently proposed for modeling amplitude\nvalues of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image pixels. However, inferences from\nsuch model are based on the maximum likelihood estimators, which can be biased\nfor small signal lengths. The Rayleigh regression model for SAR images often\ntakes into account small pixel windows, which may lead to inaccurate results.\nIn this letter, we introduce bias-adjusted estimators tailored for the Rayleigh\nregression model based on: (i) the Cox and Snell's method; (ii) the Firth's\nscheme; and (iii) the parametric bootstrap method. We present numerical\nexperiments considering synthetic and actual SAR data sets. The bias-adjusted\nestimators yield nearly unbiased estimates and accurate modeling results.",

    "abstract": "For general quadratically-constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), we\npropose a parabolic relaxation described with convex quadratic constraints. An\ninteresting property of the parabolic relaxation is that the original\nnon-convex feasible set is contained on the boundary of the parabolic\nrelaxation. Under certain assumptions, this property enables one to recover\nnear-optimal feasible points via objective penalization. Moreover, through an\nappropriate change of coordinates that requires a one-time computation of an\noptimal basis, the easier-to-solve parabolic relaxation can be made as strong\nas a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation, which can be effective in\naccelerating algorithms that require solving a sequence of convex surrogates.\nThe majority of theoretical and computational results are given in the next\npart of this work [57].",

    "abstract": "For the demonstration of ultra-wideband bandwidth and pencil-beamforming, the\nterahertz (THz)-band has been envisioned as one of the key enabling\ntechnologies for the sixth generation networks. However, the acquisition of the\nTHz channel entails several unique challenges such as severe path loss and\nbeam-split. Prior works usually employ ultra-massive arrays and additional\nhardware components comprised of time-delayers to compensate for these loses.\nIn order to provide a cost-effective solution, this paper introduces a\nsparse-Bayesian-learning (SBL) technique for joint channel and beam-split\nestimation. Specifically, we first model the beam-split as an array\nperturbation inspired from array signal processing. Next, a low-complexity\napproach is developed by exploiting the line-of-sight-dominant feature of THz\nchannel to reduce the computational complexity involved in the proposed SBL\ntechnique for channel estimation (SBCE). Additionally, based on\nfederated-learning, we implement a model-free technique to the proposed\nmodel-based SBCE solution. Further to that, we examine the near-field\nconsiderations of THz channel, and introduce the range-dependent near-field\nbeam-split. The theoretical performance bounds, i.e., Cram\\'er-Rao lower\nbounds, are derived for near- and far-field parameters, e.g., user directions,\nranges and beam-split, and several numerical experiments are conducted.\nNumerical simulations demonstrate that SBCE outperforms the existing approaches\nand exhibits lower hardware cost.",

    "abstract": "The Granger Causality (GC) test is a famous statistical hypothesis test for\ninvestigating if the past of one time series affects the future of the other.\nIt helps in answering the question whether one time series is helpful in\nforecasting. Standard traditional approaches to Granger causality detection\ncommonly assume linear dynamics, but such simplification does not hold in many\nreal-world applications, e.g., neuroscience or genomics that are inherently\nnon-linear. In such cases, imposing linear models such as Vector Autoregressive\n(VAR) models can lead to inconsistent estimation of true Granger Causal\ninteractions. Machine Learning (ML) can learn the hidden patterns in the\ndatasets specifically Deep Learning (DL) has shown tremendous promise in\nlearning the non-linear dynamics of complex systems. Recent work of Tank et al\npropose to overcome the issue of linear simplification in VAR models by using\nneural networks combined with sparsity-inducing penalties on the learn-able\nweights. In this work, we build upon ideas introduced by Tank et al. We propose\nseveral new classes of models that can handle underlying non-linearity.\nFirstly, we present the Learned Kernal VAR(LeKVAR) model-an extension of VAR\nmodels that also learns kernel parametrized by a neural net. Secondly, we show\none can directly decouple lags and individual time series importance via\ndecoupled penalties. This decoupling provides better scaling and allows us to\nembed lag selection into RNNs. Lastly, we propose a new training algorithm that\nsupports mini-batching, and it is compatible with commonly used adaptive\noptimizers such as Adam.he proposed techniques are evaluated on several\nsimulated datasets inspired by real-world applications.We also apply these\nmethods to the Electro-Encephalogram (EEG) data for an epilepsy patient to\nstudy the evolution of GC before , during and after seizure across the 19 EEG\nchannels.",

    "abstract": "Learned video compression methods have gained a variety of interest in the\nvideo coding community since they have matched or even exceeded the\nrate-distortion (RD) performance of traditional video codecs. However, many\ncurrent learning-based methods are dedicated to utilizing short-range temporal\ninformation, thus limiting their performance. In this paper, we focus on\nexploiting the unique characteristics of video content and further exploring\ntemporal information to enhance compression performance. Specifically, for\nlong-range temporal information exploitation, we propose temporal prior that\ncan update continuously within the group of pictures (GOP) during inference. In\nthat case temporal prior contains valuable temporal information of all decoded\nimages within the current GOP. As for short-range temporal information, we\npropose a progressive guided motion compensation to achieve robust and\neffective compensation. In detail, we design a hierarchical structure to\nachieve multi-scale compensation. More importantly, we use optical flow\nguidance to generate pixel offsets between feature maps at each scale, and the\ncompensation results at each scale will be used to guide the following scale's\ncompensation. Sufficient experimental results demonstrate that our method can\nobtain better RD performance than state-of-the-art video compression\napproaches.

    "abstract": "We consider a persuasion problem between a sender and a receiver whose\nutility may be nonlinear in her belief; we call such receivers risk-conscious.\nSuch utility models arise when the receiver exhibits systematic biases away\nfrom expected-utility-maximization, such as uncertainty aversion (e.g., from\nsensitivity to the variance of the waiting time for a service). Due to this\nnonlinearity, the standard approach to finding the optimal persuasion mechanism\nusing revelation principle fails. To overcome this difficulty, we use the\nunderlying geometry of the problem to develop a convex optimization framework\nto find the optimal persuasion mechanism. We define the notion of full\npersuasion and use our framework to characterize conditions under which full\npersuasion can be achieved. We use our approach to study binary persuasion,\nwhere the receiver has two actions and the sender strictly prefers one of them\nat every state. Under a convexity assumption, we show that the binary\npersuasion problem reduces to a linear program, and establish a canonical set\nof signals where each signal either reveals the state or induces in the\nreceiver uncertainty between two states. Finally, we discuss the broader\napplicability of our methods to more general contexts, and illustrate our\nmethodology by studying information sharing of waiting times in service\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "Avian flocks display a wide variety of flight behaviors, including steady\ndirected translation of center of mass, rapid change of overall morphology,\nre-shuffling of positions of individuals within a persistent form, etc. These\nbehaviors may be viewed as flock-scale strategies, emerging from interactions\nbetween individuals, accomplishing some collective adaptive purpose such as\nfinding a roost, or mitigating the danger from predator attacks. While we do\nnot conceive the flock as a single cognitive agent, the moment-to-moment\ndecisions of individuals, influenced by their neighbors, appear as if to\nrealize collective strategies that are cognizant of purpose. In this paper, we\nidentify the actions of the flock as allocation of energetic resources, and\nthereby associate a cognitive cost to behavior. Our notion of cognitive cost\nreflects the burden arising from rapid re-allocation of resource. Using a\nrecently developed natural geometric approach to kinetic energy allocation, we\nmap the flock behavior to a temporal signature on the standard (probability)\nsimplex. Given the signature of a flocking event, we calculate the cognitive\ncost as a solution to an optimal control problem based on a game-theoretic\nmodel. Alternatively, one can associate to a signature an entropic cost. These\ntwo cost measures, when applied to data on starling flocks, show a consistent\nspread in value across events, and we suggest the possibility that higher cost\nmay arise from predator attacks.",

    "abstract": "Supervised deep learning needs a large amount of labeled data to achieve high\nperformance. However, in medical imaging analysis, each site may only have a\nlimited amount of data and labels, which makes learning ineffective. Federated\nlearning (FL) can learn a shared model from decentralized data. But traditional\nFL requires fully-labeled data for training, which is very expensive to obtain.\nSelf-supervised contrastive learning (CL) can learn from unlabeled data for\npre-training, followed by fine-tuning with limited annotations. However, when\nadopting CL in FL, the limited data diversity on each site makes federated\ncontrastive learning (FCL) ineffective. In this work, we propose two federated\nself-supervised learning frameworks for volumetric medical image segmentation\nwith limited annotations. The first one features high accuracy and fits\nhigh-performance servers with high-speed connections. The second one features\nlower communication costs, suitable for mobile devices. In the first framework,\nfeatures are exchanged during FCL to provide diverse contrastive data to each\nsite for effective local CL while keeping raw data private. Global structural\nmatching aligns local and remote features for a unified feature space among\ndifferent sites. In the second framework, to reduce the communication cost for\nfeature exchanging, we propose an optimized method FCLOpt that does not rely on\nnegative samples. To reduce the communications of model download, we propose\nthe predictive target network update (PTNU) that predicts the parameters of the\ntarget network. Based on PTNU, we propose the distance prediction (DP) to\nremove most of the uploads of the target network. Experiments on a cardiac MRI\ndataset show the proposed two frameworks substantially improve the segmentation\nand generalization performance compared with state-of-the-art techniques.",

    "title": "Network Critical Slowing Down: Data-Driven Detection of Critical  Transitions in Nonlinear Networks",
    "abstract": "In a Nature article, Scheffer et al. presented a novel data-driven framework\nto predict critical transitions in complex systems. These transitions, which\nmay stem from failures, degradation, or adversarial actions, have been\nattributed to bifurcations in the nonlinear dynamics. Their approach was built\nupon the phenomenon of critical slowing down, i.e., slow recovery in response\nto small perturbations near bifurcations. We extend their approach to detect\nand localize critical transitions in nonlinear networks. By introducing the\nnotion of network critical slowing down, the objective of this paper is to\ndetect that the network is undergoing a bifurcation only by analyzing its\nsignatures from measurement data. We focus on two classes of widely-used\nnonlinear networks: (1) Kuramoto model for the synchronization of coupled\noscillators and (2) attraction-repulsion dynamics in swarms, each of which\npresents a specific type of bifurcation. Based on the phenomenon of critical\nslowing down, we study the asymptotic behavior of the perturbed system away and\nclose to the bifurcation and leverage this fact to develop a deterministic\nmethod to detect and identify critical transitions in nonlinear networks.\nFurthermore, we study the state covariance matrix subject to a stochastic noise\nprocess away and close to the bifurcation and use it to develop a stochastic\nframework for detecting critical transitions. Our simulation results show the\nstrengths and limitations of the methods.",

The proposed framework is equipped with three\nimportant components, namely, dual-network collaborative learning,\nreunderampling data augmentation and a specially designed co-training loss.

    "abstract": "The generation of three-dimensional (3D) medical images can have great\napplication potential since it takes into account the 3D anatomical structure.\nThere are two problems, however, that prevent effective training of a 3D\nmedical generative model: (1) 3D medical images are very expensive to acquire\nand annotate, resulting in an insufficient number of training images, (2) a\nlarge number of parameters are involved in 3D convolution. To address both\nproblems, we propose a novel GAN model called 3D Split&Shuffle-GAN. In order to\naddress the 3D data scarcity issue, we first pre-train a two-dimensional (2D)\nGAN model using abundant image slices and inflate the 2D convolution weights to\nimprove initialization of the 3D GAN. Novel 3D network architectures are\nproposed for both the generator and discriminator of the GAN model to\nsignificantly reduce the number of parameters while maintaining the quality of\nimage generation. A number of weight inflation strategies and\nparameter-efficient 3D architectures are investigated.

In this\npaper, we propose FRA-RIR, a fast random approximation method of the\nwidely-used image-source method (ISM), to efficiently generate realistic RIR\ndata without specific computational devices. FRA-RIR replaces the physical\nsimulation in the standard ISM by a series of random approximations, which\nsignificantly speeds up the simulation process and enables its application in\non-the-fly data generation pipelines. Experiments show that FRA-RIR can not\nonly be significantly faster than other existing ISM-based RIR simulation tools\non standard computational platforms, but also improves the performance of\nspeech denoising systems evaluated on real-world RIR when trained with\nsimulated RIR. A Python implementation of FRA-RIR is available\nonline\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/yluo42/FRA-RIR}}.",

    "abstract": "Precision medicine provides customized treatments to patients based on their\ncharacteristics and is a promising approach to improving treatment efficiency.\nLarge scale omics data are useful for patient characterization, but often their\nmeasurements change over time, leading to longitudinal data. Random forest is\none of the state-of-the-art machine learning methods for building prediction\nmodels, and can play a crucial role in precision medicine. In this paper, we\nreview extensions of the standard random forest method for the purpose of\nlongitudinal data analysis. Extension methods are categorized according to the\ndata structures for which they are designed. We consider both univariate and\nmultivariate responses and further categorize the repeated measurements\naccording to whether the time effect is relevant. Information of available\nsoftware implementations of the reviewed extensions is also given. We conclude\nwith discussions on the limitations of our review and some future research\ndirections.",

    "title": "Deep Machine Learning Reconstructing Lattice Topology with Strong  Thermal Fluctuations",
    "abstract": "Applying artificial intelligence to scientific problems (namely AI for\nscience) is currently under hot debate. However, the scientific problems differ\nmuch from the conventional ones with images, texts, and etc., where new\nchallenges emerges with the unbalanced scientific data and complicated effects\nfrom the physical setups. In this work, we demonstrate the validity of the deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) on reconstructing the lattice topology\n(i.e., spin connectivities) in the presence of strong thermal fluctuations and\nunbalanced data. Taking the kinetic Ising model with Glauber dynamics as an\nexample, the CNN maps the time-dependent local magnetic momenta (a single-node\nfeature) evolved from a specific initial configuration (dubbed as an evolution\ninstance) to the probabilities of the presences of the possible couplings. Our\nscheme distinguishes from the previous ones that might require the knowledge on\nthe node dynamics, the responses from perturbations, or the evaluations of\nstatistic quantities such as correlations or transfer entropy from many\nevolution instances. The fine tuning avoids the \"barren plateau\" caused by the\nstrong thermal fluctuations at high temperatures. Accurate reconstructions can\nbe made where the thermal fluctuations dominate over the correlations and\nconsequently the statistic methods in general fail. Meanwhile, we unveil the\ngeneralization of CNN on dealing with the instances evolved from the unlearnt\ninitial spin configurations and those with the unlearnt lattices. We raise an\nopen question on the learning with unbalanced data in the nearly\n\"double-exponentially\" large sample space.",

    "abstract": "For a long time, water and hydroelectric power are relatively important\nresources. Their rational distribution is closely related to regional\nagriculture, industry, residents, etc. In this paper, we mainly study the\nproblem of allocation scheme for Glen Canyon Dam and Hoover Dam in the Colorado\nRiver Basin. Taking into consideration of various factors, we build models to\nachieve optimal scheduling. Firstly, we propose the Water Strategy Decision\nModel, which can obtain different distribution methods for the different water\nlevels. Also, we connect the two dams in series to consider the coupling effect\nbetween them and integrate this part into the main model. Secondly, we propose\nthree criteria of allocation for water and power generation, namely, economic,\nsocial, and environmental benefits. Social benefits mainly include the minimum\nshortage of water and electricity for agriculture, industry, and residents. For\nthis multi-objective plan, the model is solved using a multi-objective ant\ncolony genetic algorithm under the constraint of constant total water volume,\nand finally, the current reservoir capacities of the two lakes are input to\nderive the annual water supply to the five states. Thirdly, based on the\nlocation and development characteristics of the five states, we obtain a water\nscheduling model based on the priority of geographic-industry characteristics.\nFourthly, we can regard the model as a four-dimensional space of industrial,\nagricultural, residential and power generation water demand. The partial\nderivative calculation formula of multi-dimensional space can be used to obtain\nthe results. Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of the model, and it shows\nthat the model has strong adaptability and is easier to popularize. Moreover,\nwe discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the models.",

    "abstract": "Liquid metals (LM) are embedded in an elastomer matrix to obtain soft\ncomposites with unique thermal, dielectric, and mechanical properties. They\nhave applications in soft robotics, biomedical engineering, and wearable\nelectronics. By linking the structure to the properties of these materials, it\nis possible to perform material design rationally. Liquid-metal embedded\nelastomers (LMEEs) have been designed for targeted electro-thermo-mechanical\nproperties by semi-supervised learning of structure-property (SP) links in a\nvariational autoencoder network (VAE). The design parameters are the\nmicrostructural descriptors that are physically meaningful and have affine\nrelationships with the synthetization of the studied particulate composite. The\nmachine learning (ML) model is trained on a generated dataset of\nmicrostructural descriptors with their multifunctional property quantities as\ntheir labels. Sobol sequence is used for in-silico Design of Experiment (DoE)\nby sampling the design space to generate a comprehensive dataset of 3D\nmicrostructure realizations via a packing algorithm. The mechanical responses\nof the generated microstructures are simulated using a previously developed\nFinite Element (FE) model, considering the surface tension induced by LM\ninclusions, while the linear thermal and dielectric constants are homogenized\nwith the help of our in-house Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) package. Following\nthe training by minimization of an appropriate loss function, the VAE encoder\nacts as the surrogate of numerical solvers of the multifunctional\nhomogenizations, and its decoder is used for the material design. Our results\nindicate the satisfactory performance of the surrogate model and the inverse\ncalculator with respect to high-fidelity numerical simulations validated with\nLMEE experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Finding quantitative descriptors representing the microstructural features of\na given material is an ongoing research area in the paradigm of\nMaterials-by-Design. Historically, microstructural analysis mostly relies on\nqualitative descriptions. However, to build a robust and accurate\nprocess-structure-properties relationship, which is required for designing new\nadvanced high-performance materials, the extraction of quantitative and\nmeaningful statistical data from the microstructural analysis is a critical\nstep. In recent years, computer vision (CV) methods, especially those which are\ncentered around convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms have shown\npromising results for this purpose. This review paper focuses on the\nstate-of-the-art CNN-based techniques that have been applied to various\nmulti-scale microstructural image analysis tasks, including classification,\nobject detection, segmentation, feature extraction, and reconstruction.\nAdditionally, we identified the main challenges with regard to the application\nof these methods to materials science research.

    "abstract": "We show that the spectral theorem -- which we understand to be a statement\nthat every self-adjoint matrix admits a certain type of canonical form under\nunitary similarity -- admits analogues over other $*$-algebras distinct from\nthe complex numbers. If these $*$-algebras contain nilpotents, then it is shown\nthat there is a consistent way in which many classic matrix decompositions --\nsuch as the Singular Value Decomposition, the Takagi decomposition, the\nskew-Takagi decomposition, and the Jordan decomposition, among others -- are\nimmediate consequences of these. If producing the relevant canonical form of a\nself-adjoint matrix were a subroutine in some programming language, then the\ncorresponding classic matrix decomposition would be a 1-line invocation with no\nadditional steps. We also suggest that by employing operator overloading in a\nprogramming language, a numerical algorithm for computing a unitary\ndiagonalisation of a complex self-adjoint matrix would generalise immediately\nto solving problems like SVD or Takagi. While algebras without nilpotents (like\nthe quaternions) allow for similar unifying behaviour, the classic matrix\ndecompositions which they unify are never obtained as easily. In the process of\ndoing this, we develop some spectral theory over Clifford algebras of the form\n$\\cl_{p,q,0}(\\mathbb R)$ and $\\cl_{p,q,1}(\\mathbb R)$ where the former is\nadmittedly quite easy.

We define two\nlevels of hierarchical redundancy in video frames: 1) first-order: redundancy\nin pixel space, i.e., similarities in pixel values across neighboring frames,\nwhich is effectively captured using motion and residual compensation, 2)\nsecond-order: redundancy in motion and residual maps due to smooth motion in\nnatural videos. While most of the existing neural video coding literature\naddresses first-order redundancy, we tackle the problem of capturing\nsecond-order redundancy in neural video codecs via predictors. We introduce\ngeneric motion and residual predictors that learn to extrapolate from\npreviously decoded data. These predictors are lightweight, and can be employed\nwith most neural video codecs in order to improve their rate-distortion\nperformance. Moreover, while RGB is the dominant colorspace in neural video\ncoding literature, we introduce general modifications for neural video codecs\nto embrace the YUV420 colorspace and report YUV420 results.
