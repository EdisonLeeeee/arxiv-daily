    "abstract": "Entity alignment is a crucial task in knowledge graph fusion. However, most\nentity alignment approaches have the scalability problem. Recent methods\naddress this issue by dividing large KGs into small blocks for embedding and\nalignment learning in each. However, such a partitioning and learning process\nresults in an excessive loss of structure and alignment. Therefore, in this\nwork, we propose a scalable GNN-based entity alignment approach to reduce the\nstructure and alignment loss from three perspectives. First, we propose a\ncentrality-based subgraph generation algorithm to recall some landmark entities\nserving as the bridges between different subgraphs. Second, we introduce\nself-supervised entity reconstruction to recover entity representations from\nincomplete neighborhood subgraphs, and design cross-subgraph negative sampling\nto incorporate entities from other subgraphs in alignment learning. Third,\nduring the inference process, we merge the embeddings of subgraphs to make a\nsingle space for alignment search. Experimental results on the benchmark OpenEA\ndataset and the proposed large DBpedia1M dataset verify the effectiveness of\nour approach.",

    "abstract": "Authors make their videos visually accessible by adding audio descriptions\n(AD), and auditorily accessible by adding closed captions (CC). However,\ncreating AD and CC is challenging and tedious, especially for non-professional\ndescribers and captioners, due to the difficulty of identifying accessibility\nproblems in videos. A video author will have to watch the video through and\nmanually check for inaccessible information frame-by-frame, for both visual and\nauditory modalities. In this paper, we present CrossA11y, a system that helps\nauthors efficiently detect and address visual and auditory accessibility issues\nin videos. Using cross-modal grounding analysis, CrossA11y automatically\nmeasures accessibility of visual and audio segments in a video by checking for\nmodality asymmetries. CrossA11y then displays these segments and surfaces\nvisual and audio accessibility issues in a unified interface, making it\nintuitive to locate, review, script AD/CC in-place, and preview the described\nand captioned video immediately. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CrossA11y\nthrough a lab study with 11 participants, comparing to existing baseline.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we study multi-domain learning for face anti-spoofing(MD-FAS),\nwhere a pre-trained FAS model needs to be updated to perform equally well on\nboth source and target domains while only using target domain data for\nupdating. We present a new model for MD-FAS, which addresses the forgetting\nissue when learning new domain data, while possessing a high level of\nadaptability. First, we devise a simple yet effective module, called spoof\nregion estimator(SRE), to identify spoof traces in the spoof image. Such spoof\ntraces reflect the source pre-trained model's responses that help upgraded\nmodels combat catastrophic forgetting during updating. Unlike prior works that\nestimate spoof traces which generate multiple outputs or a low-resolution\nbinary mask, SRE produces one single, detailed pixel-wise estimate in an\nunsupervised manner. Secondly, we propose a novel framework, named FAS-wrapper,\nwhich transfers knowledge from the pre-trained models and seamlessly integrates\nwith different FAS models. Lastly, to help the community further advance\nMD-FAS, we construct a new benchmark based on SIW, SIW-Mv2 and Oulu-NPU, and\nintroduce four distinct protocols for evaluation, where source and target\ndomains are different in terms of spoof type, age, ethnicity, and illumination.\nOur proposed method achieves superior performance on the MD-FAS benchmark than\nprevious methods.

For a function $f:\\mathcal{X}\\times\n\\mathcal{Y}\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}$, the $n$-fold XOR function $f^{\\oplus\nn}:\\mathcal{X}^n\\times \\mathcal{Y}^n\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}$ maps $n$ input pairs\n$(X_1,\\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\\ldots,Y_n)$ to the XOR of the $n$ output bits\n$f(X_1,Y_1)\\oplus \\cdots \\oplus f(X_n, Y_n)$. We prove that if every $r$-round\ncommunication protocols that computes $f$ with probability $2/3$ uses at least\n$C$ bits of communication, then any $r$-round protocol that computes $f^{\\oplus\nn}$ with probability $1/2+\\exp(-O(n))$ must use $n\\cdot \\left(r^{-O(r)}\\cdot\nC-1\\right)$ bits.

It matches the communication cost and the success\nprobability of the trivial protocol that computes the $n$ bits $f(X_i,Y_i)$\nindependently and outputs their XOR, up to a constant factor in $n$.\nA similar XOR lemma has been proved for $f$ whose communication lower bound\ncan be obtained via bounding the discrepancy [Shaltiel'03].

A major theme in the time-domain numerical modeling of this\nproblem has been tackling the difficulty of handling the nonlocal term involved\nin the time-domain polarization equation. Based on the diffusive representation\nand the quadrature formula, we derive an approximate system, where the\nconvolution kernel is replaced by a finite number of auxiliary variables that\nsatisfy local-in-time ordinary differential equations.

We term the secondary\nfrequency regulator a Micro-Automatic Generation Control (Micro-AGC) for\nhighlighting its same functionality as the AGC in bulk power systems. We\nidentify sensory challenges and cyber threats facing the Micro-AGC. To address\nthe sensory challenges, we introduce a new microgrid model by exploiting the\nrank-one deficiency property of microgrid dynamics.

An end-to-end cyber security\nsolution to the False Data Injection (FDI) attack detection and mitigation is\ndeveloped for the proposed Micro-AGC.

In UML, an aggregation is a type of association in which objects\nare configured together to form a more complex object. It has been described as\none of the biggest betes noires in modeling. In spite of its widespread use,\naggregation seems a troublesome concept. It is sometimes treated as part-of;\nhowever, the part-of relation is only one of many possible aggregation\nmechanisms and is itself problematical, partly because of its diverse\nsemantics. The purpose of this paper is to develop a semantic assembly model\nthat is useful to represent relationships in the domain and achieve various\nlevels of interoperability among software. The paper contributes to ontological\nconceptual clarity about aggregation, based on a model called a thinging\nmachine (TM). The TM model uses so-called thimacs (things/machines) as building\nblocks for describing the domain. Thus, the notion of aggregation is extended\nto behavioral aggregation, in which individual entities collectively behave as\na unit.

This line of work is necessary to understand the hardware better and\nbuild more efficient workloads and applications.

    "abstract": "Label noise is common in large real-world datasets, and its presence harms\nthe training process of deep neural networks. Although several works have\nfocused on the training strategies to address this problem, there are few\nstudies that evaluate the impact of data augmentation as a design choice for\ntraining deep neural networks. In this work, we analyse the model robustness\nwhen using different data augmentations and their improvement on the training\nwith the presence of noisy labels. We evaluate state-of-the-art and classical\ndata augmentation strategies with different levels of synthetic noise for the\ndatasets MNist, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and the real-world dataset Clothing1M. We\nevaluate the methods using the accuracy metric. Results show that the\nappropriate selection of data augmentation can drastically improve the model\nrobustness to label noise, increasing up to 177.84% of relative best test\naccuracy compared to the baseline with no augmentation, and an increase of up\nto 6% in absolute value with the state-of-the-art DivideMix training strategy.",

    "abstract": "Relying on the fact that not all inputs require the same amount of\ncomputation to yield a confident prediction, multi-exit networks are gaining\nattention as a prominent approach for pushing the limits of efficient\ndeployment. Multi-exit networks endow a backbone model with early exits,\nallowing to obtain predictions at intermediate layers of the model and thus\nsave computation time and/or energy. However, current various designs of\nmulti-exit networks are only considered to achieve the best trade-off between\nresource usage efficiency and prediction accuracy, the privacy risks stemming\nfrom them have never been explored. This prompts the need for a comprehensive\ninvestigation of privacy risks in multi-exit networks.\nIn this paper, we perform the first privacy analysis of multi-exit networks\nthrough the lens of membership leakages. In particular, we first leverage the\nexisting attack methodologies to quantify the multi-exit networks'\nvulnerability to membership leakages. Our experimental results show that\nmulti-exit networks are less vulnerable to membership leakages and the exit\n(number and depth) attached to the backbone model is highly correlated with the\nattack performance. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid attack that exploits the\nexit information to improve the performance of existing attacks. We evaluate\nmembership leakage threat caused by our hybrid attack under three different\nadversarial setups, ultimately arriving at a model-free and data-free\nadversary. These results clearly demonstrate that our hybrid attacks are very\nbroadly applicable, thereby the corresponding risks are much more severe than\nshown by existing membership inference attacks. We further present a defense\nmechanism called TimeGuard specifically for multi-exit networks and show that\nTimeGuard mitigates the newly proposed attacks perfectly.",

    "abstract": "Dermatological diseases pose a major threat to the global health, affecting\nalmost one-third of the world's population. Various studies have demonstrated\nthat early diagnosis and intervention are often critical to prognosis and\noutcome. To this end, the past decade has witnessed the rapid evolvement of\ndeep learning based smartphone apps, which allow users to conveniently and\ntimely identify issues that have emerged around their skins. In order to\ncollect sufficient data needed by deep learning and at the same time protect\npatient privacy, federated learning is often used, where individual clients\naggregate a global model while keeping datasets local. However, existing\nfederated learning frameworks are mostly designed to optimize the overall\nperformance, while common dermatological datasets are heavily imbalanced. When\napplying federated learning to such datasets, significant disparities in\ndiagnosis accuracy may occur. To address such a fairness issue, this paper\nproposes a fairness-aware federated learning framework for dermatological\ndisease diagnosis. The framework is divided into two stages: In the first in-FL\nstage, clients with different skin types are trained in a federated learning\nprocess to construct a global model for all skin types. An automatic weight\naggregator is used in this process to assign higher weights to the client with\nhigher loss, and the intensity of the aggregator is determined by the level of\ndifference between losses. In the latter post-FL stage, each client fine-tune\nits personalized model based on the global model in the in-FL stage. To achieve\nbetter fairness, models from different epochs are selected for each client to\nkeep the accuracy difference of different skin types within 0.05. Experiments\nindicate that our proposed framework effectively improves both fairness and\naccuracy compared with the state-of-the-art.",

We begin with a\nsurvey of the available distance metrics for permutations, and then use\nprincipal component analysis to classify these metrics. The result of this\nanalysis aligns with existing classifications of permutation problem types\nproduced through less formal means, including the A-permutation, R-permutation,\nand P-permutation types, which classifies problems by whether absolute position\nof permutation elements, relative positions of elements, or general precedence\nof pairs of elements, is the dominant influence over solution fitness.\nAdditionally, the formal analysis identifies subtypes within these problem\ncategories. We see that the classification can assist in identifying\nappropriate metrics based on optimization problem feature for use in fitness\nlandscape analysis. Using optimization problems of each class, we also\ndemonstrate how the classification scheme can subsequently inform the choice of\nmutation operator within an evolutionary algorithm. From this, we present a\nclassification of a variety of mutation operators as a counterpart to that of\nthe metrics. Our implementations of the permutation metrics, permutation\nmutation operators, and associated evolutionary algorithm, are available in a\npair of open source Java libraries.

    "abstract": "Traditional analyses in non-convex optimization typically rely on the\nsmoothness assumption, namely requiring the gradients to be Lipschitz. However,\nrecent evidence shows that this smoothness condition does not capture the\nproperties of some deep learning objective functions, including the ones\ninvolving Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTMs. Instead, they satisfy a much\nmore relaxed condition, with potentially unbounded smoothness. Under this\nrelaxed assumption, it has been theoretically and empirically shown that the\ngradient-clipped SGD has an advantage over the vanilla one. In this paper, we\nshow that clipping is not indispensable for Adam-type algorithms in tackling\nsuch scenarios: we theoretically prove that a generalized SignSGD algorithm can\nobtain similar convergence rates as SGD with clipping but does not need\nexplicit clipping at all. This family of algorithms on one end recovers SignSGD\nand on the other end closely resembles the popular Adam algorithm. Our analysis\nunderlines the critical role that momentum plays in analyzing SignSGD-type and\nAdam-type algorithms: it not only reduces the effects of noise, thus removing\nthe need for large mini-batch in previous analyses of SignSGD-type algorithms,\nbut it also substantially reduces the effects of unbounded smoothness and\ngradient norms. We also compare these algorithms with popular optimizers on a\nset of deep learning tasks, observing that we can match the performance of Adam\nwhile beating the others.",

A wide range of blockchain solutions has been\nintroduced, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger technologies in the\nliterature.

This paper also sheds\nlight on the configuration parameters (inputs) and produced metrics (outputs)\nsupported by each simulator. Furthermore, it investigates which metrics\nsupported by each simulator are scientifically validated/evaluated. Moreover,\ncode quality comparison is carried out to assess the source code of the covered\nsimulators. The results reveal that no simulator fully covers the wide\noperational range of features and capabilities of existing blockchain\ntechnologies.

    "abstract": "Accurately estimating a battery's state of health (SOH) helps prevent\nbattery-powered applications from failing unexpectedly. With the superiority of\nreducing the data requirement of model training for new batteries, transfer\nlearning (TL) emerges as a promising machine learning approach that applies\nknowledge learned from a source battery, which has a large amount of data.\nHowever, the determination of whether the source battery model is reasonable\nand which part of information can be transferred for SOH estimation are rarely\ndiscussed, despite these being critical components of a successful TL. To\naddress these challenges, this paper proposes an interpretable TL-based SOH\nestimation method by exploiting the temporal dynamic to assist transfer\nlearning, which consists of three parts. First, with the help of dynamic time\nwarping, the temporal data from the discharge time series are synchronized,\nyielding the warping path of the cycle-synchronized time series responsible for\ncapacity degradation over cycles. Second, the canonical variates retrieved from\nthe spatial path of the cycle-synchronized time series are used for\ndistribution similarity analysis between the source and target batteries.\nThird, when the distribution similarity is within the predefined threshold, a\ncomprehensive target SOH estimation model is constructed by transferring the\ncommon temporal dynamics from the source SOH estimation model and compensating\nthe errors with a residual model from the target battery. Through a widely-used\nopen-source benchmark dataset, the estimation error of the proposed method\nevaluated by the root mean squared error is as low as 0.0034 resulting in a 77%\naccuracy improvement compared with existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Running deep neural networks (DNNs) on tiny Micro-controller Units (MCUs) is\nchallenging due to their limitations in computing, memory, and storage\ncapacity. Fortunately, recent advances in both MCU hardware and machine\nlearning software frameworks make it possible to run fairly complex neural\nnetworks on modern MCUs, resulting in a new field of study widely known as\nTinyML. However, there have been few studies to show the potential for TinyML\napplications in cyber physical systems (CPS). In this paper, we present\nDeepPicarMicro, a small self-driving RC car testbed, which runs a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) on a Raspberry Pi Pico MCU. We apply a state-of-the-art\nDNN optimization to successfully fit the well-known PilotNet CNN architecture,\nwhich was used to drive NVIDIA's real self-driving car, on the MCU. We apply a\nstate-of-art network architecture search (NAS) approach to find further\noptimized networks that can effectively control the car in real-time in an\nend-to-end manner. From an extensive systematic experimental evaluation study,\nwe observe an interesting relationship between the accuracy, latency, and\ncontrol performance of a system. From this, we propose a joint optimization\nstrategy that takes both accuracy and latency of a model in the network\narchitecture search process for AI enabled CPS.",

    "abstract": "This is a theoretical paper, as a companion paper of the keynote talk at the\nsame conference.\nIn contrast to conscious learning, many projects in AI have employed deep\nlearning many of which seem to give impressive performance data.\nThis paper explains that such performance data are probably misleadingly\ninflated due to two possible misconducts: data deletion and test on training\nset. This paper clarifies what is data deletion in deep learning and what is\ntest on training set in deep learning and why they are misconducts. A simple\nclassification method is defined, called nearest neighbor with threshold\n(NNWT). A theorem is established that the NNWT method reaches a zero error on\nany validation set and any test set using Post-Selections, as long as the test\nset is in the possession of the author and both the amount of storage space and\nthe time of training are finite but unbounded like with many deep learning\nmethods. However, like many deep learning methods, the NNWT method has little\ngeneralization power. The evidence that misconducts actually took place in many\ndeep learning projects is beyond the scope of this paper. Without a transparent\naccount about freedom from Post-Selections, deep learning data are misleading.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an adaptive learning method for data fusion in autonomous\ndriving vehicles. The localization is based on the integration of Inertial\nMeasurement Unit (IMU) with two Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Positioning\nSystem (GPS) units in an adaptive Kalman filter (KF). The observability\nanalysis reveals that $i$) integration of a single GPS with IMU does not\nconstitute an observable system; $ii$) integration of two GPS units with IMU\nresults in a locally observable system provided that the line connecting two\nGPS antennas is not parallel with the vector of the measured acceleration,\ni.e., the sum of inertial and gravitational accelerations. The latter case\nmakes it possible to compensate for the error in the estimated orientation due\nto gyro drift and its bias without needing additional instruments for absolute\norientation measurements, e.g., a magnetic compass. Moreover, in order to cope\nwith the fact that GPS systems sometimes lose their signal and receive\ninaccurate position data, the self-tuning filter estimates the covariance\nmatrix associated with the GPS measurement noise. This allows the KF to\nincorporate GPS measurements in the data fusion process heavily only when the\ninformation received by GPS becomes reliably available.",

    "abstract": "The digital terrain model (DTM) is fundamental geospatial data for various\nstudies in urban, environmental, and Earth science. The reliability of the\nresults obtained from such studies can be considerably affected by the errors\nand uncertainties of the underlying DTM. Numerous algorithms have been\ndeveloped to mitigate the errors and uncertainties of DTM. However, most\nalgorithms involve tricky parameter selection and complicated procedures that\nmake the algorithm's decision rule obscure, so it is often difficult to explain\nand predict the errors and uncertainties of the resulting DTM. Also, previous\nalgorithms often consider the local neighborhood of each point for\ndistinguishing non-ground objects, which limits both search radius and\ncontextual understanding and can be susceptible to errors particularly if point\ndensity varies. This study presents an open-source DTM generation algorithm for\nairborne LiDAR data that can consider beyond the local neighborhood and whose\nresults are easily explainable, predictable, and reliable. The key assumption\nof the algorithm is that grounds are smoothly connected while non-grounds are\nsurrounded by areas having sharp elevation changes.

    "abstract": "The matrix completion problem seeks to recover a $d\\times d$ ground truth\nmatrix of low rank $r\\ll d$ from observations of its individual elements.\nReal-world matrix completion is often a huge-scale optimization problem, with\n$d$ so large that even the simplest full-dimension vector operations with\n$O(d)$ time complexity become prohibitively expensive. Stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) is one of the few algorithms capable of solving matrix completion\non a huge scale, and can also naturally handle streaming data over an evolving\nground truth. Unfortunately, SGD experiences a dramatic slow-down when the\nunderlying ground truth is ill-conditioned; it requires at least\n$O(\\kappa\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ iterations to get $\\epsilon$-close to ground truth\nmatrix with condition number $\\kappa$. In this paper, we propose a\npreconditioned version of SGD that preserves all the favorable practical\nqualities of SGD for huge-scale online optimization while also making it\nagnostic to $\\kappa$. For a symmetric ground truth and the Root Mean Square\nError (RMSE) loss, we prove that the preconditioned SGD converges to\n$\\epsilon$-accuracy in $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ iterations, with a rapid linear\nconvergence rate as if the ground truth were perfectly conditioned with\n$\\kappa=1$.

More recent endeavors attempt to have a unified\napproach with legged and humanoid robots. These solutions, however, occupy\nlarge amounts of space thus reducing the number of packages that can fit into a\ndelivery vehicle. As a result, these bulky robotic systems often reduce the\npotential for scalability and task parallelization. In this paper, we introduce\nLIMMS (Latching Intelligent Modular Mobility System) to address both the\nmanipulation and delivery portion of a typical last-mile delivery while\nmaintaining a minimal spatial footprint. LIMMS is a symmetrically designed, 6\ndegree of freedom (DoF) appendage-like robot with wheels and latching\nmechanisms at both ends. By latching onto a surface and anchoring at one end,\nLIMMS can function as a traditional 6-DoF manipulator arm. On the other hand,\nmultiple LIMMS can latch onto a single box and behave like a legged robotic\nsystem where the package is the body. During transit, LIMMS folds up compactly\nand takes up much less space compared to traditional robotic systems. A large\ngroup of LIMMS units can fit inside of a single delivery vehicle, opening the\npotential for new delivery optimization and hybrid planning methods never done\nbefore. In this paper, the feasibility of LIMMS is studied and presented using\na hardware prototype as well as simulation results for a range of sub-tasks in\na typical last-mile delivery.",

To this end, we train a visual question answering (VQA)\nsystem to answer complex natural language questions about apparel in fashion\nphotoshoot images. The key to the successful training of our VQA model is the\nautomatic creation of a visual question-answering dataset with 168 million\nsamples from item attributes of 207 thousand images using diverse templates.\nThe sample generation employs a strategy that considers the difficulty of the\nquestion-answer pairs to emphasize challenging concepts.

We\nsee that using the same transformer for encoding the question and decoding the\nanswer, as in language models, achieves maximum accuracy, showing that visual\nlanguage models (VLMs) make the best visual question answering systems for our\ndataset.

To effectively learn\nsuch novel framework, we develop two essential training strategies and a novel\nmultiplicative co-modulation architecture that improves significantly upon\nnaive schemes. With extensive evaluations, we show that our method outperforms\nthe prior arts on various tasks, with better editability, stronger identity\npreservation, and higher photo-realism. In addition, we demonstrate a better\ngeneralizability of our design on large pose editing and out-of-domain images.",

    "abstract": "Optimal experimental design is an essential subfield of statistics that\nmaximizes the chances of experimental success. The D- and A-optimal design is a\nvery challenging problem in the field of optimal design, namely minimizing the\ndeterminant and trace of the inverse Fisher information matrix. Due to the\nflexibility and ease of implementation, traditional evolutionary algorithms\n(EAs) are applied to deal with a small part of experimental optimization design\nproblems without mathematical derivation and assumption. However, the current\nEAs remain the issues of determining the support point number, handling the\ninfeasible weight solution, and the insufficient experiment. To address the\nabove issues, this paper investigates differential evolution (DE) variants for\nfinding D- and A-optimal designs on several different statistical models. The\nrepair operation is proposed to automatically determine the support point by\ncombining similar support points with their corresponding weights based on\nEuclidean distance and deleting the support point with less weight.\nFurthermore, the repair operation fixes the infeasible weight solution into the\nfeasible weight solution. To enrich our optimal design experiments, we utilize\nthe proposed DE variants to test the D- and A-optimal design problems on 12\nstatistical models. Compared with other competitor algorithms, simulation\nexperiments show that LSHADE can achieve better performance on the D- and\nA-optimal design problems.",

    "abstract": "Time series anomaly detection is extensively studied in statistics,\neconomics, and computer science. Over the years, numerous methods have been\nproposed for time series anomaly detection using deep learning-based methods.\nMany of these methods demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark\ndatasets, giving the false impression that these systems are robust and\ndeployable in many practical and industrial real-world scenarios. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that the performance of state-of-the-art anomaly\ndetection methods is degraded substantially by adding only small adversarial\nperturbations to the sensor data. We use different scoring metrics such as\nprediction errors, anomaly, and classification scores over several public and\nprivate datasets ranging from aerospace applications, server machines, to\ncyber-physical systems in power plants. Under well-known adversarial attacks\nfrom Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)\nmethods, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) and\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) methods, which claim to be robust against\nanomalies and have been possibly integrated in real-life systems, have their\nperformance drop to as low as 0%. To the best of our understanding, we\ndemonstrate, for the first time, the vulnerabilities of anomaly detection\nsystems against adversarial attacks. The overarching goal of this research is\nto raise awareness towards the adversarial vulnerabilities of time series\nanomaly detectors.",

Previous works assumed strong\nprior knowledge about the incoming data (e.g., knowing the class boundaries)\nwhich can be impossible to obtain in complex and unpredictable environments. In\nthis paper, motivated by real-world scenarios, we formally define the online\nunsupervised lifelong learning problem with class-incremental streaming data,\nwhich is non-iid and single-pass. The problem is more challenging than existing\nlifelong learning problems due to the absence of labels and prior knowledge. To\naddress the issue, we propose Self-Supervised ContrAstive Lifelong LEarning\n(SCALE) which extracts and memorizes knowledge on-the-fly. SCALE is designed\naround three major components: a pseudo-supervised contrastive loss, a\nself-supervised forgetting loss, and an online memory update for uniform subset\nselection. All three components are designed to work collaboratively to\nmaximize learning performance. Our loss functions leverage pairwise similarity\nthus remove the dependency on supervision or prior knowledge. We perform\ncomprehensive experiments of SCALE under iid and four non-iid data streams.\nSCALE outperforms the best state-of-the-art algorithm on all settings with\nimprovements of up to 6.43%, 5.23% and 5.86% kNN accuracy on CIFAR-10,\nCIFAR-100 and SubImageNet datasets.",

Another important advantage is that each data\npoint is sanitized independently from the others, and therefore different users\nmay use different levels of obfuscation depending on their privacy\nrequirements, or they may even use entirely different mechanisms depending on\nthe services they are trading their data for. A challenging requirement in this\nsetting is to construct the original distribution on the users sensitive data\nfrom their noisy versions. Existing techniques can only estimate that\ndistribution separately on each obfuscation schema and corresponding noisy data\nsubset. But the smaller are the subsets, the more imprecise the estimations\nare. In this paper we study how to avoid the subsets-fractioning problem when\ncombining local privacy mechanisms, thus recovering an optimal utility.

However, due to the restriction of\nmulti-head self-attention and GPU memory, there is a limit on the input token\nlength. The existing pretrained code models, such as GraphCodeBERT, CodeBERT,\nRoBERTa (code), take the first 256 tokens by default, which makes them unable\nto represent the complete information of long code (i.e., code that is greater\nthan 256 tokens). Unlike the long text document that can be regarded as a whole\nwith complete semantics, the semantics of long code is discontinuous as a piece\nof long code may contain different code modules. Therefore, it is unreasonable\nto directly apply the long text processing methods to long code. To tackle the\nlong code problem, we propose MLCS (Modeling Long Code for Code Search) to\nobtain a better representation for long code. Our experimental results show the\neffectiveness of MLCS for long code retrieval. With MLCS, we could use\nTransformer-based pretraining models to model long code without changing their\ninternal structure and re-pretraining.

Leveraging the characteristic that\nNDSs will react to various disturbances and the disturbance's influence will\nconsistently spread, this paper focuses on inferring the topology by a few\nactive excitations. The key challenge is to distinguish different influences of\nsystem noises and excitations from the exhibited state deviations, where the\ninfluences will decay with time and the exciatation cannot be arbitrarily\nlarge. To practice, we propose a one-shot excitation based inference method to\ninfer $h$-hop neighbors of a node. The excitation conditions for accurate\none-hop neighbor inference are first derived with probability guarantees. Then,\nwe extend the results to $h$-hop neighbor inference and multiple excitations\ncases, providing the explicit relationships between the inference accuracy and\nexcitation magnitude. Specifically, the excitation based inference method is\nnot only suitable for scenarios where abundant observations are unavailable,\nbut also can be leveraged as auxiliary means to improve the accuracy of\nexisting methods.

However, most existing approaches either\nsequentially extract task-specific features, leading to insufficient feature\ninteractions, or they encode aspect features and sentiment features in a\nparallel manner, implying that feature representation in each task is largely\nindependent of each other except for input sharing. Both of them ignore the\ninternal correlations between the aspect extraction and sentiment\nclassification. To solve this problem, we novelly propose a hierarchical\ninteractive network (HI-ASA) to model two-way interactions between two tasks\nappropriately, where the hierarchical interactions involve two steps:\nshallow-level interaction and deep-level interaction. First, we utilize\ncross-stitch mechanism to combine the different task-specific features\nselectively as the input to ensure proper two-way interactions. Second, the\nmutual information technique is applied to mutually constrain learning between\ntwo tasks in the output layer, thus the aspect input and the sentiment input\nare capable of encoding features of the other task via backpropagation.\nExtensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate HI-ASA's\nsuperiority over baselines.",

    "abstract": "Although many long-range imaging systems are designed to support extended\nvision applications, a natural obstacle to their operation is degradation due\nto atmospheric turbulence. Atmospheric turbulence causes significant\ndegradation to image quality by introducing blur and geometric distortion. In\nrecent years, various deep learning-based single image atmospheric turbulence\nmitigation methods, including CNN-based and GAN inversion-based, have been\nproposed in the literature which attempt to remove the distortion in the image.\nHowever, some of these methods are difficult to train and often fail to\nreconstruct facial features and produce unrealistic results especially in the\ncase of high turbulence. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have\nrecently gained some traction because of their stable training process and\ntheir ability to generate high quality images. In this paper, we propose the\nfirst DDPM-based solution for the problem of atmospheric turbulence mitigation.\nWe also propose a fast sampling technique for reducing the inference times for\nconditional DDPMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on synthetic and\nreal-world data to show the significance of our model. To facilitate further\nresearch, all codes and pretrained models will be made public after the review\nprocess.",

    "abstract": "Neural network (NN)-based methods have emerged as an attractive approach for\nrobot motion planning due to strong learning capabilities of NN models and\ntheir inherently high parallelism. Despite the current development in this\ndirection, the efficient capture and processing of important sequential and\nspatial information, in a direct and simultaneous way, is still relatively\nunder-explored. To overcome the challenge and unlock the potentials of neural\nnetworks for motion planning tasks, in this paper, we propose STP-Net, an\nend-to-end learning framework that can fully extract and leverage important\nspatio-temporal information to form an efficient neural motion planner. By\ninterpreting the movement of the robot as a video clip, robot motion planning\nis transformed to a video prediction task that can be performed by STP-Net in\nboth spatially and temporally efficient ways. Empirical evaluations across\ndifferent seen and unseen environments show that, with nearly 100% accuracy\n(aka, success rate), STP-Net demonstrates very promising performance with\nrespect to both planning speed and path cost. Compared with existing NN-based\nmotion planners, STP-Net achieves at least 5x, 2.6x and 1.8x faster speed with\nlower path cost on 2D Random Forest, 2D Maze and 3D Random Forest environments,\nrespectively. Furthermore, STP-Net can quickly and simultaneously compute\nmultiple near-optimal paths in multi-robot motion planning tasks",

The method employs a\nstrong It\\^o--Taylor scheme for simulating SDE paths, and adaptively decreases\nthe step-size in the numerical integration as the solution approaches the\nboundary of the domain. These techniques turn out to complement each other\nnicely: adaptive time-stepping improves the accuracy of the exit time by\nreducing the magnitude of the overshoot of the numerical solution when it exits\nthe domain, and higher-order schemes improve the approximation of the state of\nthe diffusion process. We present two versions of the higher-order adaptive\nmethod. The first one uses the Milstein scheme as numerical integrator and two\nstep-sizes for adaptive time-stepping: $h$ when far away from the boundary and\n$h^2$ when close to the boundary. The second method is an extension of the\nfirst one using the strong It\\^o--Taylor scheme of order 1.5 as numerical\nintegrator and three step-sizes for adaptive time-stepping.

To support people working in\ndangerous industries, VR can ensure operators manipulate standardized tasks and\nwork collaboratively to deal with potential risks. Surprisingly, little\nresearch has focused on how people can collaboratively work in VR environments.\nFew studies have paid attention to the cognitive load of operators in their\ncollaborative tasks. Once task demands become complex, many researchers focus\non optimizing the design of the interaction interfaces to reduce the cognitive\nload on the operator. That approach could be of merit; however, it can actually\nsubject operators to a more significant cognitive load and potentially more\nerrors and a failure of collaboration. In this paper, we propose a new\ncollaborative VR system to support two teleoperators working in the VR\nenvironment to remote control an uncrewed ground vehicle. We use a compared\nexperiment to evaluate the collaborative VR systems, focusing on the time spent\non tasks and the total number of operations.

However, current works on video understanding mainly focus on\nvideo content summarization, while little effort has been made to explore the\nstructure of a video. Inspired by textual outline generation, we introduce a\nnovel video understanding task, namely video outline generation (VOG). This\ntask is defined to contain two sub-tasks: (1) first segmenting the video\naccording to the content structure and then (2) generating a heading for each\nsegment. To learn and evaluate VOG, we annotate a 10k+ dataset, called DuVOG.\nSpecifically, we use OCR tools to recognize subtitles of videos. Then\nannotators are asked to divide subtitles into chapters and title each chapter.\nIn videos, highlighted text tends to be the headline since it is more likely to\nattract attention. Therefore we propose a Visual Subtitle feature Enhanced\nvideo outline generation model (VSENet) which takes as input the textual\nsubtitles together with their visual font sizes and positions. We consider the\nVOG task as a sequence tagging problem that extracts spans where the headings\nare located and then rewrites them to form the final outlines. Furthermore,\nbased on the similarity between video outlines and textual outlines, we use a\nlarge number of articles with chapter headings to pretrain our model.\nExperiments on DuVOG show that our model largely outperforms other baseline\nmethods, achieving 77.1 of F1-score for the video segmentation level and 85.0\nof ROUGE-L_F0.5 for the headline generation level.",

It\nachieves this by leveraging local dataset distillation instead of traditional\nlearning approaches (i) to significantly reduce communication volumes and (ii)\nto limit transfers to one-shot communication, rather than iterative multiway\ncommunication. Instead of sharing model updates, as in other federated learning\napproaches, FedD3 allows the connected clients to distill the local datasets\nindependently, and then aggregates those decentralized distilled datasets\n(typically in the form a few unrecognizable images, which are normally smaller\nthan a model) across the network only once to form the final model. Our\nexperimental results show that FedD3 significantly outperforms other federated\nlearning frameworks in terms of needed communication volumes, while it provides\nthe additional benefit to be able to balance the trade-off between accuracy and\ncommunication cost, depending on usage scenario or target dataset. For\ninstance, for training an AlexNet model on a Non-IID CIFAR-10 dataset with 10\nclients, FedD3 can either increase the accuracy by over 71% with a similar\ncommunication volume, or save 98% of communication volume, while reaching the\nsame accuracy, comparing to other one-shot federated learning approaches.",

To this\nend, we construct an internal reference dataset and retrieve reference image\npatches from the dataset using depth information. Using LR patches and their\ncorresponding HR reference patches, we train a RefSR network that is embodied\nwith a non-local attention module. Experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed RZSR compared to the previous ZSSR methods and\nrobustness to unseen images compared to other fully supervised SISR methods.",

    "abstract": "In multi-modal action recognition, it is important to consider not only the\ncomplementary nature of different modalities but also global action content. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel network, named Modality Mixer (M-Mixer) network,\nto leverage complementary information across modalities and temporal context of\nan action for multi-modal action recognition. We also introduce a simple yet\neffective recurrent unit, called Multi-modal Contextualization Unit (MCU),\nwhich is a core component of M-Mixer. Our MCU temporally encodes a sequence of\none modality (e.g., RGB) with action content features of other modalities\n(e.g., depth, IR). This process encourages M-Mixer to exploit global action\ncontent and also to supplement complementary information of other modalities.\nAs a result, our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on NTU\nRGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets. Moreover, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of M-Mixer by conducting comprehensive ablation studies.",

Many object detection algorithms have been released, and many have\ncompared object detection algorithms, but few have compared the latest\nalgorithms, such as YOLOv5, primarily which focus on street-level objects. This\npaper compares various one-stage detector algorithms; SSD MobileNetv2 FPN-lite\n320x320, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5s for street-level object detection\nwithin real-time images. The experiment utilizes a modified Udacity Self\nDriving Car Dataset with 3,169 images. Dataset is split into train, validation,\nand test; Then, it is preprocessed and augmented using rescaling, hue shifting,\nand noise. Each algorithm is then trained and evaluated. Based on the\nexperiments, the algorithms have produced decent results according to the\ninference time and the values of their precision, recall, F1-Score, and Mean\nAverage Precision (mAP). The results also shows that YOLOv5l outperforms the\nother algorithms in terms of accuracy with a mAP@.5 of 0.593, MobileNetv2\nFPN-lite has the fastest inference time among the others with only 3.20ms\ninference time. It is also found that YOLOv5s is the most efficient, with it\nhaving a YOLOv5l accuracy and a speed almost as quick as the MobileNetv2\nFPN-lite. This shows that various algorithm are suitable for street-level\nobject detection and viable enough to be used in self-driving car.",

    "abstract": "As an efficient algorithm to solve the multi-view registration problem,the\nmotion averaging (MA) algorithm has been extensively studied and many MA-based\nalgorithms have been introduced. They aim at recovering global motions from\nrelative motions and exploiting information redundancy to average accumulative\nerrors. However, one property of these methods is that they use Guass-Newton\nmethod to solve a least squares problem for the increment of global motions,\nwhich may lead to low efficiency and poor robustness to outliers. In this\npaper, we propose a novel motion averaging framework for the multi-view\nregistration with Laplacian kernel-based maximum correntropy criterion (LMCC).\nUtilizing the Lie algebra motion framework and the correntropy measure, we\npropose a new cost function that takes all constraints supplied by relative\nmotions into account. Obtaining the increment used to correct the global\nmotions, can further be formulated as an optimization problem aimed at\nmaximizing the cost function. By virtue of the quadratic technique, the\noptimization problem can be solved by dividing into two subproblems, i.e.,\ncomputing the weight for each relative motion according to the current\nresiduals and solving a second-order cone program problem (SOCP) for the\nincrement in the next iteration. We also provide a novel strategy for\ndetermining the kernel width which ensures that our method can efficiently\nexploit information redundancy supplied by relative motions in the presence of\nmany outliers. Finally, we compare the proposed method with other MA-based\nmulti-view registration methods to verify its performance. Experimental tests\non synthetic and real data demonstrate that our method achieves superior\nperformance in terms of efficiency, accuracy and robustness.",

Previous 3D pose estimation methods have\nfocused on various modifications to the graph convolution kernel, such as\nabandoning weight sharing or increasing the receptive field. Some of these\nmethods employ attention-based non-local modules as auxiliary modules. In order\nto better model the relationship between nodes in graph-structured data and\nfuse the information of different neighbor nodes in a differentiated way, we\nmake targeted modifications to the attention module and propose two modules\ndesigned for graph-structured data, graph relative positional encoding\nmulti-head self-attention (GR-MSA) and K-order graph-oriented multi-head\nself-attention (KOG-MSA).

Furthermore, we propose a\nnetwork for shape estimation on hand data, called GraAttention shape estimation\nnetwork (GASE-Net), which takes a 3D pose as input and gradually models the\nshape of the hand from sparse to dense.

    "abstract": "Computer programs, so-called solvers, for solving the well-known Boolean\nsatisfiability problem (Sat) have been improving for decades. Among the\nreasons, why these solvers are so fast, is the implicit usage of the formula's\nstructural properties during solving. One of such structural indicators is the\nso-called treewidth, which tries to measure how close a formula instance is to\nbeing easy (tree-like). This work focuses on logic-based problems and\ntreewidth-based methods and tools for solving them. Many of these problems are\nalso relevant for knowledge representation and reasoning (KR) as well as\nartificial intelligence (AI) in general. We present a new type of problem\nreduction, which is referred to by decomposition-guided (DG). This reduction\ntype forms the basis to solve a problem for quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs)\nof bounded treewidth that has been open since 2004. The solution of this\nproblem then gives rise to a new methodology for proving precise lower bounds\nfor a range of further formalisms in logic, KR, and AI. Despite the established\nlower bounds, we implement an algorithm for solving extensions of Sat\nefficiently, by directly using treewidth. Our implementation is based on\nfinding abstractions of instances, which are then incrementally refined in the\nprocess. Thereby, our observations confirm that treewidth is an important\nmeasure that should be considered in the design of modern solvers.",

The missile swarm is modeled\nby a second-order system with heterogeneous reference target, and exponential\nerror function is made to be the objective function such that the swarm\nconverge to optimal equilibrium states satisfying certain formation\nrequirements. Focusing on the issue of local optimum and unstable evolution, we\nincorporate a novel model-based policy constraint and a population adaptation\nstrategies that greatly alleviates the performance degradation. With\napplication of the Molloy-Reed criterion in the field of network communication,\nwe developed an adaptive topology method that assure the connectivity under\nnode failure and its effectiveness are validated both theoretically and\nexperimentally.

    "abstract": "The sparsity of extrinsic rewards poses a serious challenge for reinforcement\nlearning (RL). Currently, many efforts have been made on curiosity which can\nprovide a representative intrinsic reward for effective exploration. However,\nthe challenge is still far from being solved. In this paper, we present a novel\ncuriosity for RL, named DyMeCu, which stands for Dynamic Memory-based\nCuriosity. Inspired by human curiosity and information theory, DyMeCu consists\nof a dynamic memory and dual online learners. The curiosity arouses if\nmemorized information can not deal with the current state, and the information\ngap between dual learners can be formulated as the intrinsic reward for agents,\nand then such state information can be consolidated into the dynamic memory.\nCompared with previous curiosity methods, DyMeCu can better mimic human\ncuriosity with dynamic memory, and the memory module can be dynamically grown\nbased on a bootstrap paradigm with dual learners. On multiple benchmarks\nincluding DeepMind Control Suite and Atari Suite, large-scale empirical\nexperiments are conducted and the results demonstrate that DyMeCu outperforms\ncompetitive curiosity-based methods with or without extrinsic rewards.

    "abstract": "Sample selection is an effective strategy to mitigate the effect of label\nnoise in robust learning. Typical strategies commonly apply the small-loss\ncriterion to identify clean samples. However, those samples lying around the\ndecision boundary with large losses usually entangle with noisy examples, which\nwould be discarded with this criterion, leading to the heavy degeneration of\nthe generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a novel selection\nstrategy, \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{F}il\\textbf{t}ering (SFT), that utilizes the\nfluctuation of noisy examples in historical predictions to filter them, which\ncan avoid the selection bias of the small-loss criterion for the boundary\nexamples. Specifically, we introduce a memory bank module that stores the\nhistorical predictions of each example and dynamically updates to support the\nselection for the subsequent learning iteration. Besides, to reduce the\naccumulated error of the sample selection bias of SFT, we devise a\nregularization term to penalize the confident output distribution. By\nincreasing the weight of the misclassified categories with this term, the loss\nfunction is robust to label noise in mild conditions. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on three benchmarks with variant noise types and achieve the new\nstate-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "Multi-scale features have been proven highly effective for object detection,\nand most ConvNet-based object detectors adopt Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) as\na basic component for exploiting multi-scale features. However, for the\nrecently proposed Transformer-based object detectors, directly incorporating\nmulti-scale features leads to prohibitive computational overhead due to the\nhigh complexity of the attention mechanism for processing high-resolution\nfeatures. This paper presents Iterative Multi-scale Feature Aggregation (IMFA)\n-- a generic paradigm that enables the efficient use of multi-scale features in\nTransformer-based object detectors. The core idea is to exploit sparse\nmulti-scale features from just a few crucial locations, and it is achieved with\ntwo novel designs. First, IMFA rearranges the Transformer encoder-decoder\npipeline so that the encoded features can be iteratively updated based on the\ndetection predictions. Second, IMFA sparsely samples scale-adaptive features\nfor refined detection from just a few keypoint locations under the guidance of\nprior detection predictions. As a result, the sampled multi-scale features are\nsparse yet still highly beneficial for object detection. Extensive experiments\nshow that the proposed IMFA boosts the performance of multiple\nTransformer-based object detectors significantly yet with slight computational\noverhead.

Meanwhile, the sum of the corner function and the internal function\ncorresponds to the particular solution, and the two boundary functions\ncorrespond to the general solutions which satisfy the homogeneous form of the\nequation.

In this\npaper, instead of using a single reference string for the entire collection, we\ninvestigate the use of different reference strings for subsets of the\ncollection, with the aim of improving compression. In particular, we form a\nrooted tree (or hierarchy) on the strings and then compressed each string using\nRLZ with parent as reference, storing only the root of the tree in plain text.\nTo decompress, we traverse the tree in BFS order starting at the root,\ndecompressing children with respect to their parent. We show that this approach\nleads to a twofold improvement in compression on bacterial genome data sets,\nwith negligible effect on decompression time compared to the standard single\nreference approach. We show that an effective hierarchy for a given set of\nstrings can be constructed by computing the optimal arborescence of a completed\nweighted digraph of the strings, with weights as the number of phrases in the\nRLZ parsing of the source and destination vertices.

    "abstract": "Non-uniform image deblurring is a challenging task due to the lack of\ntemporal and textural information in the blurry image itself. Complementary\ninformation from auxiliary sensors such event sensors are being explored to\naddress these limitations. The latter can record changes in a logarithmic\nintensity asynchronously, called events, with high temporal resolution and high\ndynamic range. Current event-based deblurring methods combine the blurry image\nwith events to jointly estimate per-pixel motion and the deblur operator. In\nthis paper, we argue that a divide-and-conquer approach is more suitable for\nthis task. To this end, we propose to use modulated deformable convolutions,\nwhose kernel offsets and modulation masks are dynamically estimated from events\nto encode the motion in the scene, while the deblur operator is learned from\nthe combination of blurry image and corresponding events. Furthermore, we\nemploy a coarse-to-fine multi-scale reconstruction approach to cope with the\ninherent sparsity of events in low contrast regions. Importantly, we introduce\nthe first dataset containing pairs of real RGB blur images and related events\nduring the exposure time.

    "abstract": "In feed-forward time-sensitive networks with Deficit Round-Robin (DRR),\nworst-case delay bounds were obtained by combining Total Flow Analysis (TFA)\nwith the strict service curve characterization of DRR by Tabatabaee et al. The\nlatter is the best-known single server analysis of DRR, however the former is\ndominated by Polynomial-size Linear Programming (PLP), which improves the TFA\nbounds and stability region, but was never applied to DRR networks. We first\nperform the necessary adaptation of PLP to DRR by computing burstiness bounds\nper-class and per-output aggregate and by enabling PLP to support non-convex\nservice curves. Second, we extend the methodology to support networks with\ncyclic dependencies: This raises further dependency loops, as, on one hand, DRR\nstrict service curves rely on traffic characteristics inside the network, which\ncomes as output of the network analysis, and on the other hand, TFA or PLP\nrequires prior knowledge of the DRR service curves. This can be solved by\niterative methods, however PLP itself requires making cuts, which imposes other\nlevels of iteration, and it is not clear how to combine them. We propose a\ngeneric method, called PLP-DRR, for combining all the iterations sequentially\nor in parallel. We show that the obtained bounds are always valid even before\nconvergence; furthermore, at convergence, the bounds are the same regardless of\nhow the iterations are combined. This provides the best-known worst-case bounds\nfor time-sensitive networks, with general topology, with DRR.

While part localization has shown\nsignificant success, it uses either na{\\i}ve position-based partitions or\nstatic feature templates. These, however, hypothesize the pre-existence of the\nparts in a given image or their positions, ignoring the input image-specific\ninformation which limits their usability in challenging scenarios such as Re-ID\nwith partial occlusions and partial probe images. In this paper, we introduce a\nspatial attention-based Dynamic Part Template Initialization module that\ndynamically generates part-templates using mid-level semantic features at the\nearlier layers of the backbone. Following a self-attention layer, human\npart-level features of the backbone are used to extract the templates of\ndiverse human body parts using a simplified cross-attention scheme which will\nthen be used to identify and collate representations of various human parts\nfrom semantically rich features, increasing the discriminative ability of the\nentire model. We further explore adaptive weighting of part descriptors to\nquantify the absence or occlusion of local attributes and suppress the\ncontribution of the corresponding part descriptors to the matching criteria.\nExtensive experiments on holistic, occluded, and partial Re-ID task benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our proposed architecture is able to achieve competitive\nperformance.

Recent work shows that this limitation persists\nin state-of-the-art Transformer-based models. Most solutions to this problem\nuse specific architectures or training methods that do not generalize to other\ntasks. We demonstrate that large language models can succeed in extrapolation\nwithout modifying their architecture or training procedure. Experimental\nresults show that generating step-by-step rationales and introducing marker\ntokens are both required for effective extrapolation. First, we induce it to\nproduce step-by-step rationales before outputting the answer to effectively\ncommunicate the task to the model. However, as sequences become longer, we find\nthat current models struggle to keep track of token positions. To address this\nissue, we interleave output tokens with markup tokens that act as explicit\npositional and counting symbols.

The key point of\nmulti-scenario modeling is to efficiently maximize the use of whole-scenario\ninformation and granularly generate adaptive representations both for users and\nitems among multiple scenarios. we summarize three practical challenges which\nare not well solved for multi-scenario modeling: (1) Lacking of fine-grained\nand decoupled information transfer controls among multiple scenarios.

In this paper, we propose a\nScenario-Adaptive and Self-Supervised (SASS) model to solve the three\nchallenges mentioned above. Specifically, we design a Multi-Layer Scenario\nAdaptive Transfer (ML-SAT) module with scenario-adaptive gate units to select\nand fuse effective transfer information from whole scenario to individual\nscenario in a quite fine-grained and decoupled way. To sufficiently exploit the\npower of entire space samples, a two-stage training process including\npre-training and fine-tune is introduced.

The navigation within complex\nbronchial trees is particularly challenging and physically demanding, requiring\nlong-term experiences of physicians. This paper addresses the automatic\nsegmentation of bronchial orifices in bronchoscopy videos. Deep learning-based\napproaches to this task are currently hampered due to the lack of\nreadily-available ground truth segmentation data. Thus, we present a\ndata-driven pipeline consisting of a k-means followed by a compact marker-based\nwatershed algorithm which enables to generate airway instance segmentation maps\nfrom given depth images. In this way, these traditional algorithms serve as\nweak supervision for training a shallow CNN directly on RGB images solely based\non a phantom dataset. We evaluate generalization capabilities of this model on\ntwo in-vivo datasets covering 250 frames on 21 different bronchoscopies. We\ndemonstrate that its performance is comparable to those models being directly\ntrained on in-vivo data, reaching an average error of 11 vs 5 pixels for the\ndetected centers of the airway segmentation by an image resolution of 128x128.\nOur quantitative and qualitative results indicate that in the context of video\nbronchoscopy, phantom data and weak supervision using non-learning-based\napproaches enable to gain a semantic understanding of airway structures.",

    "abstract": "The softmax-based loss functions and its variants (e.g., cosface, sphereface,\nand arcface) significantly improve the face recognition performance in wild\nunconstrained scenes. A common practice of these algorithms is to perform\noptimizations on the multiplication between the embedding features and the\nlinear transformation matrix. However in most cases, the dimension of embedding\nfeatures is given based on traditional design experience, and there is\nless-studied on improving performance using the feature itself when giving a\nfixed size. To address this challenge, this paper presents a softmax\napproximation method called SubFace, which employs the subspace feature to\npromote the performance of face recognition. Specifically, we dynamically\nselect the non-overlapping subspace features in each batch during training, and\nthen use the subspace features to approximate full-feature among softmax-based\nloss, so the discriminability of the deep model can be significantly enhanced\nfor face recognition. Comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that our method can significantly improve the performance of\nvanilla CNN baseline, which strongly proves the effectiveness of subspace\nstrategy with the margin-based loss.",

In addition, temporarily static objects, which are static\nduring observation but move when they are out of sight, trigger false positive\nloop closings. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel visual-inertial\nSLAM framework, called DynaVINS, which is robust against both dynamic objects\nand temporarily static objects.

    "abstract": "Deep prompt tuning (DPT) has gained great success in most natural language\nprocessing~(NLP) tasks. However, it is not well-investigated in dense retrieval\nwhere fine-tuning~(FT) still dominates. When deploying multiple retrieval tasks\nusing the same backbone model~(e.g., RoBERTa), FT-based methods are unfriendly\nin terms of deployment cost: each new retrieval model needs to repeatedly\ndeploy the backbone model without reuse. To reduce the deployment cost in such\na scenario, this work investigates applying DPT in dense retrieval. The\nchallenge is that directly applying DPT in dense retrieval largely\nunderperforms FT methods. To compensate for the performance drop, we propose\ntwo model-agnostic and task-agnostic strategies for DPT-based retrievers,\nnamely retrieval-oriented intermediate pretraining and unified negative mining,\nas a general approach that could be compatible with any pre-trained language\nmodel and retrieval task. The experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod (called DPTDR) outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on both\nMS-MARCO and Natural Questions. We also conduct ablation studies to examine the\neffectiveness of each strategy in DPTDR.

    "title": "A novel method for data augmentation: Nine Dot Moving Least Square  (ND-MLS)",
    "abstract": "Data augmentation greatly increases the amount of data obtained based on\nlabeled data to save on expenses and labor for data collection and labeling. We\npresent a new approach for data augmentation called nine-dot MLS (ND-MLS). This\napproach is proposed based on the idea of image defor-mation. Images are\ndeformed based on control points, which are calculated by ND-MLS. The method\ncan generate over 2000 images for one exist-ing dataset in a short time. To\nverify this data augmentation method, extensive tests were performed covering 3\nmain tasks of computer vision, namely, classification, detection and\nsegmentation. The results show that 1) in classification, 10 images per\ncategory were used for training, and VGGNet can obtain 92% top-1 acc on the\nMNIST dataset of handwritten digits by ND-MLS. In the Omniglot dataset, the\nfew-shot accuracy usu-ally decreases with the increase in character categories.\nHowever, the ND-MLS method has stable performance and obtains 96.5 top-1 acc in\nRes-Net on 100 different handwritten character classification tasks; 2) in\nsegmentation, under the premise of only ten original images, DeepLab obtains\n93.5%, 85%, and 73.3% m_IOU(10) on the bottle, horse, and grass test datasets,\nrespectively, while the cat test dataset obtains 86.7% m_IOU(10) with the\nSegNet model; 3) with only 10 original images from each category in object\ndetection, YOLO v4 obtains 100% and 97.2% bottle and horse detection,\nrespectively, while the cat dataset obtains 93.6% with YOLO v3. In summary,\nND-MLS can perform well on classification, object detec-tion, and semantic\nsegmentation tasks by using only a few data.",

    "abstract": "Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) has been an essential module for object\ndetection models to consider various scales of an object. However, average\nprecision (AP) on small objects is relatively lower than AP on medium and large\nobjects. The reason is why the deeper layer of CNN causes information loss as\nfeature extraction level. We propose a new scale sequence (S^2) feature\nextraction of FPN to strengthen feature information of small objects. We\nconsider FPN structure as scale-space and extract scale sequence (S^2) feature\nby 3D convolution on the level axis of FPN. It is basically scale invariant\nfeature and is built on high-resolution pyramid feature map for small objects.\nFurthermore, the proposed S^2 feature can be extended to most object detection\nmodels based on FPN. We demonstrate the proposed S2 feature can improve the\nperformance of both one-stage and two-stage detectors on MS COCO dataset. Based\non the proposed S2 feature, we achieve upto 1.3% and 1.1% of AP improvement for\nYOLOv4-P5 and YOLOv4-P6, respectively. For Faster RCNN and Mask R-CNN, we\nobserve upto 2.0% and 1.6% of AP improvement with the suggested S^2 feature,\nrespectively.",

The choice of the regularization parameter has significant impact on\nthe performance of LASSO-ADMM algorithm. However, the optimization for the\nregularization parameter in the existing LASSO-ADMM algorithms has not been\nsolved yet. In order to optimize this regularization parameter, we propose an\nefficient iterative adaptively regularized LASSO-ADMM (IAR-LASSO-ADMM)\nalgorithm by iteratively updating the regularization parameter in the\nLASSO-ADMM algorithm. Moreover, a method is designed to iteratively update the\nregularization parameter by adding an outer iteration to the LASSO-ADMM\nalgorithm. Specifically, at each outer iteration the zero support of the\nestimate obtained by the inner LASSO-ADMM algorithm is utilized to estimate the\nnoise variance, and the noise variance is utilized to update the threshold\naccording to a pre-defined const false alarm rate (CFAR). Then, the resulting\nthreshold is utilized to update both the non-zero support of the estimate and\nthe regularization parameter, and proceed to the next inner iteration. In\naddition, a suitable stopping criterion is designed to terminate the outer\niteration process to obtain the final non-zero support of the estimate of the\nsparse measurement signals. The resulting algorithm is termed as\nIAR-LASSO-ADMM-CFAR algorithm. Finally, simulation results have been presented\nto show that the proposed IAR-LASSO-ADMM-CFAR algorithm outperforms the\nconventional LASSO-ADMM algorithm and other existing algorithms in terms of\nreconstruction accuracy, and its sparsity order estimate is more accurate than\nthe existing algorithms.",

In this\npaper, we introduce a new compression framework which covers both weight\npruning and quantization in a unified setting, is time- and space-efficient,\nand considerably improves upon the practical performance of existing\npost-training methods. At the technical level, our approach is based on the\nfirst exact and efficient realization of the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon\n(OBS) framework of [LeCun, Denker, and Solla, 1990] at the scale of modern\nDNNs, which we further extend to cover weight quantization. This is enabled by\na series of algorithmic developments which may be of independent interest. From\nthe practical perspective, our experimental results show that it can improve\nsignificantly upon the compression-accuracy trade-offs of existing\npost-training methods, and that it can even enable the accurate joint\napplication of both pruning and quantization in a post-training setting.",

Second, a\nbody-centered semantic map, encoding the objects classifications and\ncorresponding uncertainties, is sequentially updated with the calibrated\ndetections, considering several data fusion techniques. Third, the next best\ngaze fixation point is determined based on information-theoretic metrics that\naim at minimizing the overall expected uncertainty of the semantic map.

    "abstract": "Split computing has emerged as a recent paradigm for implementation of\nDNN-based AI workloads, wherein a DNN model is split into two parts, one of\nwhich is executed on a mobile/client device and the other on an edge-server (or\ncloud). Data compression is applied to the intermediate tensor from the DNN\nthat needs to be transmitted, addressing the challenge of optimizing the\nrate-accuracy-complexity trade-off. Existing split-computing approaches adopt\nML-based data compression, but require that the parameters of either the entire\nDNN model, or a significant portion of it, be retrained for different\ncompression levels. This incurs a high computational and storage burden:\ntraining a full DNN model from scratch is computationally demanding,\nmaintaining multiple copies of the DNN parameters increases storage\nrequirements, and switching the full set of weights during inference increases\nmemory bandwidth. In this paper, we present an approach that addresses all\nthese challenges. It involves the systematic design and training of bottleneck\nunits - simple, low-cost neural networks - that can be inserted at the point of\nsplit. Our approach is remarkably lightweight, both during training and\ninference, highly effective and achieves excellent rate-distortion performance\nat a small fraction of the compute and storage overhead compared to existing\nmethods.",

However, the existing methods of\napplying the event camera to object detection tasks using deep learning methods\nstill have many problems. First, existing methods cannot take into account\nobjects with different velocities relative to the motion of the event camera\ndue to the global synchronized time window and temporal resolution. Second,\nmost of the existing methods rely on large parameter neural networks, which\nimplies a large computational burden and low inference speed, thus contrary to\nthe high temporal resolution of the event stream.\nIn our work, we design a high-speed lightweight detector called Agile Event\nDetector (AED) with a simple but effective data augmentation method. Also, we\npropose an event stream representation tensor called Temporal Active Focus\n(TAF), which takes full advantage of the asynchronous generation of event\nstream data and is robust to the motion of moving objects. It can also be\nconstructed without much time-consuming. We further propose a module called the\nBifurcated Folding Module (BFM) to extract the rich temporal information in the\nTAF tensor at the input layer of the AED detector. We conduct our experiments\non two typical real-scene event camera object detection datasets: the complete\nProphesee GEN1 Automotive Detection Dataset and the Prophesee 1 MEGAPIXEL\nAutomotive Detection Dataset with partial annotation. Experiments show that our\nmethod is competitive in terms of accuracy, speed, and the number of parameters\nsimultaneously.

In\nthis context, priors are seen as an attractive way to alleviate the burden of\nmanual labeling when training deep learning methods for EO.

    "title": "Repair Is Nearly Generation: Multilingual Program Repair with LLMs",
    "abstract": "Most programmers make mistakes when writing code. Some of these mistakes are\nsmall and require few edits to the original program - a class of errors\nrecently termed last mile mistakes. These errors break the flow for experienced\ndevelopers and can stump novice programmers. Existing automated repair\ntechniques targeting this class of errors are domain-specific and do not easily\ncarry over to new domains. Transferring symbolic approaches requires\nsubstantial engineering and neural approaches require data and retraining. We\nintroduce RING, a multilingual repair engine powered by a large language model\ntrained on code (LLMC) such as Codex. Such a multilingual engine enables a\nflipped model for programming assistance, one where the programmer writes code\nand the AI assistance suggests fixes, compared to traditional code suggestion\ntechnology. Taking inspiration from the way programmers manually fix bugs, we\nshow that a prompt-based strategy that conceptualizes repair as localization,\ntransformation, and candidate ranking, can successfully repair programs in\nmultiple domains with minimal effort. We present the first results for such a\nmultilingual repair engine by evaluating on 6 different domains and comparing\nperformance to domain-specific repair engines. We show that RING can outperform\ndomain-specific repair engines in 3 of these domains. We also identify\ndirections for future research using LLMCs for multilingual repair.",

    "abstract": "Object detection methods have witnessed impressive improvements in the last\nyears thanks to the design of novel neural network architectures and the\navailability of large scale datasets. However, current methods have a\nsignificant limitation: they are able to detect only the classes observed\nduring training time, that are only a subset of all the classes that a detector\nmay encounter in the real world. Furthermore, the presence of unknown classes\nis often not considered at training time, resulting in methods not even able to\ndetect that an unknown object is present in the image. In this work, we address\nthe problem of detecting unknown objects, known as open-set object detection.\nWe propose a novel training strategy, called UNKAD, able to predict unknown\nobjects without requiring any annotation of them, exploiting non annotated\nobjects that are already present in the background of training images. In\nparticular, exploiting the four-steps training strategy of Faster R-CNN, UNKAD\nfirst identifies and pseudo-labels unknown objects and then uses the\npseudo-annotations to train an additional unknown class. While UNKAD can\ndirectly detect unknown objects, we further combine it with previous unknown\ndetection techniques, showing that it improves their performance at no costs.",

DNNs\nhave been wildly successful at pushing the performance and accuracy envelopes\nin the natural language and image processing domains. Thus, DNNs are highly\npromising for solving binary analysis problems that are typically hard due to a\nlack of complete information resulting from the lossy compilation process.\nDespite this promise, it is unclear that the prevailing strategy of repurposing\nembeddings and model architectures originally developed for other problem\ndomains is sound given the adversarial contexts under which binary analysis\noften operates.\nIn this paper, we empirically demonstrate that the current state of the art\nin neural function boundary detection is vulnerable to both inadvertent and\ndeliberate adversarial attacks. We proceed from the insight that current\ngeneration NBAs are built upon embeddings and model architectures intended to\nsolve syntactic problems. We devise a simple, reproducible, and scalable\nblack-box methodology for exploring the space of inadvertent attacks -\ninstruction sequences that could be emitted by common compiler toolchains and\nconfigurations - that exploits this syntactic design focus. We then show that\nthese inadvertent misclassifications can be exploited by an attacker, serving\nas the basis for a highly effective black-box adversarial example generation\nprocess. We evaluate this methodology against two state-of-the-art neural\nfunction boundary detectors: XDA and DeepDi.

Moreover,\nsuch a progressive model pruning approach during training can also reduce\ntraining times/costs. To this end, we propose FedSparsify, which performs model\npruning during federated training. In our experiments in centralized and\nfederated settings on the brain age prediction task (estimating a person's age\nfrom their brain MRI), we demonstrate that models can be pruned up to 95%\nsparsity without affecting performance even in challenging federated learning\nenvironments with highly heterogeneous data distributions.

To further reduce the compression cost\nwhile maintaining the quality of JPEG images, lossless transcoding technology\nhas been proposed to recompress the compressed JPEG image in the DCT domain.\nPrevious works, on the other hand, typically reduce the redundancy of DCT\ncoefficients and optimize the probability prediction of entropy coding in a\nhand-crafted manner that lacks generalization ability and flexibility. To\ntackle the above challenge, we propose the learned lossless JPEG transcoding\nframework via Joint Lossy and Residual Compression. Instead of directly\noptimizing the entropy estimation, we focus on the redundancy that exists in\nthe DCT coefficients. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize\nthe learned end-to-end lossy transform coding to reduce the redundancy of DCT\ncoefficients in a compact representational domain. We also introduce residual\ncompression for lossless transcoding, which adaptively learns the distribution\nof residual DCT coefficients before compressing them using context-based\nentropy coding. Our proposed transcoding architecture shows significant\nsuperiority in the compression of JPEG images thanks to the collaboration of\nlearned lossy transform coding and residual entropy coding.

We applied a new metric named \"dependency\nheaviness\" which measures the number of additional strong dependencies that a\npackage uniquely contributes to its child or downstream packages. It also\nmeasures the total reduced dependencies in the ecosystem when the role of a\npackage is changed from a strong parent to a weak parent. We systematically\nstudied how the dependency heaviness spreads from parent to child packages, and\nhow it further spreads to remote downstream packages in the CRAN/Bioconductor\necosystem. We extracted top packages and key paths that majorly transmit heavy\ndependencies in the ecosystem. Additionally, the dependency heaviness analysis\non the ecosystem has been implemented as a web-based database that provides\ncomprehensive tools for querying dependencies of individual R packages.",

SOniCS is thus not only a tool that facilitates\nthe development of surgical training simulations but also, and perhaps more\nimportantly, paves the way to increase the intuition of users or otherwise\nnon-intuitive behaviors of (bio)mechanical systems. The plugin uses new\ndevelopments of the FEniCSx project enabling automatic generation with FFCx of\nfinite element tensors such as the local residual vector and Jacobian matrix.\nWe validate our approach with numerical simulations such as manufactured\nsolutions, cantilever beams, and benchmarks provided by FEBio.

    "abstract": "In a recent work, we studied a novel precoding design for cell-free networks\ncalled team minimum mean-square error (TMMSE) precoding, which rigorously\ngeneralizes centralized MMSE precoding to distributed operations based on\ntransmitter-specific channel state information (CSI). Despite its flexibility\nin handling different cooperation regimes at the CSI sharing level, TMMSE\nprecoding assumes network-wide sharing of the data bearing signals, and hence\nit is inherently not scalable. In this work, inspired by recent advances on\nscalable cell-free architectures based on user-centric network clustering\ntechniques, we address this issue by proposing a novel version of the TMMSE\nprecoding design covering partial message sharing. The obtained framework is\nthen successfully applied to derive a variety of novel, optimal, and efficient\nprecoding schemes for a user-centric cell-free network deployed using multiple\nradio stripes. Numerical simulations of a typical industrial internet-of-things\nscenario corroborate the gains of TMMSE precoding over competing schemes in\nterms of spectral efficiency under different power constraints.

However,\npublishing these data may disclose personal sensitive information, resulting in\nan increasing concern on privacy violations. Privacy-preserving data publishing\nhas received considerable attention in recent years. Unfortunately, the\ndifferentially private publication of high dimensional data remains a\nchallenging problem. In this paper, we propose a differentially private\nhigh-dimensional data publication mechanism (DP2-Pub) that runs in two phases:\na Markov-blanket-based attribute clustering phase and an invariant post\nrandomization (PRAM) phase. Specifically, splitting attributes into several\nlow-dimensional clusters with high intra-cluster cohesion and low inter-cluster\ncoupling helps obtain a reasonable allocation of privacy budget, while a\ndouble-perturbation mechanism satisfying local differential privacy facilitates\nan invariant PRAM to ensure no loss of statistical information and thus\nsignificantly preserves data utility. We also extend our DP2-Pub mechanism to\nthe scenario with a semi-honest server which satisfies local differential\nprivacy.

    "abstract": "In this paper we formulate a new particle-in-cell method for the\nVlasov-Maxwell system. Using the Lorenz gauge condition, Maxwell's equations\nfor the electromagnetic fields are written as a collection of scalar and vector\nwave equations. The use of potentials for the fields motivates the adoption of\na formulation for particles that is based on a generalized Hamiltonian. A\nnotable advantage offered by this generalized formulation is the elimination of\ntime derivatives of the potentials that are required in the standard\nNewton-Lorenz treatment of particles. This allows the fields to retain the full\ntime-accuracy guaranteed by the field solver. The resulting updates for\nparticles require only knowledge of the fields and their spatial derivatives. A\nmethod for constructing analytical spatial derivatives is presented that\nexploits the underlying integral solution used in the field solver for the wave\nequations. The field solvers considered in this work belong to a larger class\nof methods which are unconditionally stable, can address geometry, and leverage\nan $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ fast summation method for efficiency, known as the Method\nof Lines Transpose (MOL$^T$). A time-consistency property of the proposed field\nsolver for the vector potential form of Maxwell's equations is established,\nwhich ensures that the semi-discrete form of the proposed method satisfies the\nsemi-discrete Lorenz gauge condition. We demonstrate the method on several\nwell-established benchmark problems involving plasmas. The efficacy of the\nproposed formulation is demonstrated through a comparison with standard methods\npresented in the literature, including the popular FDTD method.",

    "title": "Multi-objective optimization of actuation waveform for high-precision  drop-on-demand inkjet printing",
    "abstract": "Drop-on-demand (DOD) inkjet printing has been considered as one of promising\ntechnologies for the fabrication of advanced functional materials. For a DOD\nprinter, high-precision dispensing techniques for achieving satellite-free\nsmaller droplets, have long been desired for patterning thin-film structures.\nThe present study considers the inlet velocity of a liquid chamber located\nupstream of a dispensing nozzle as a control variable and aims to optimize its\nwaveform using a sample-efficient Bayesian optimization algorithm. Firstly, the\ndroplet dispensing dynamics are numerically reproduced by using an open-source\nOpenFOAM solver, interFoam, and the results are passed on to another code based\non pyFoam. Then, the parameters characterizing the actuation waveform driving a\nDOD printer are determined by the Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm so as to\nmaximize a prescribed multi-objective function expressed as the sum of two\nfactors, i.e., the size of a primary droplet and the presence of satellite\ndroplets. The results show that the present BO algorithm can successfully find\nhigh-precision dispensing waveforms within 150 simulations. Specifically,\nsatellite droplets can be effectively eliminated and the droplet diameter can\nbe significantly reduced to 24.9% of the nozzle diameter by applying the\noptimal waveform.",

    "title": "Fast emulation of density functional theory simulations using  approximate Gaussian processes",
    "abstract": "Fitting a theoretical model to experimental data in a Bayesian manner using\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo typically requires one to evaluate the model thousands\n(or millions) of times. When the model is a slow-to-compute physics simulation,\nBayesian model fitting becomes infeasible. To remedy this, a second statistical\nmodel that predicts the simulation output -- an \"emulator\" -- can be used in\nlieu of the full simulation during model fitting. A typical emulator of choice\nis the Gaussian process (GP), a flexible, non-linear model that provides both a\npredictive mean and variance at each input point. Gaussian process regression\nworks well for small amounts of training data ($n < 10^3$), but becomes slow to\ntrain and use for prediction when the data set size becomes large. Various\nmethods can be used to speed up the Gaussian process in the medium-to-large\ndata set regime ($n > 10^5$), trading away predictive accuracy for drastically\nreduced runtime. This work examines the accuracy-runtime trade-off of several\napproximate Gaussian process models -- the sparse variational GP, stochastic\nvariational GP, and deep kernel learned GP -- when emulating the predictions of\ndensity functional theory (DFT) models. Additionally, we use the emulators to\ncalibrate, in a Bayesian manner, the DFT model parameters using observed data,\nresolving the computational barrier imposed by the data set size, and compare\ncalibration results to previous work. The utility of these calibrated DFT\nmodels is to make predictions, based on observed data, about the properties of\nexperimentally unobserved nuclides of interest e.g. super-heavy nuclei.",

    "title": "A convolutional plane wave model for sound field reconstruction",
    "abstract": "Spatial sound field interpolation relies on suitable models to both conform\nto available measurements and predict the sound field in the domain of\ninterest. A suitable model can be difficult to determine when the spatial\ndomain of interest is large compared to the wavelength or when spherical and\nplanar wavefronts are present or the sound field is complex, as in the\nnear-field. To span such complex sound fields, the global reconstruction task\ncan be partitioned into local subdomain problems. Previous studies have shown\nthat partitioning approaches rely on sufficient measurements within each\ndomain, due to the higher number of model coefficients. This study proposes a\njoint analysis of all local subdomains, while enforcing self-similarity between\nneighbouring partitions. More specifically, the coefficients of local plane\nwave representations are sought to have spatially smooth magnitudes. A\nconvolutional model of the sound field in terms of plane wave filters is\nformulated and the inverse reconstruction problem is solved via the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers. The experiments on simulated and measured\nsound fields suggest, that the proposed method both retains the flexibility of\nlocal models to conform to complex sound fields and also preserves the global\nstructure to reconstruct from fewer measurements.",

To reduce scanning time, some experts have experimented with undersampled\nk spaces, trying to use deep learning to predict the fully sampled result.\nThese studies report that as many as 20 to 30 minutes could be saved off a scan\nthat takes an hour or more. However, none of these studies have explored the\npossibility of using masked image modeling (MIM) to predict the missing parts\nof MRI k spaces. This study makes use of 11161 reconstructed MRI and k spaces\nof knee MRI images from Facebook's fastmri dataset. This tests a modified\nversion of an existing model using baseline shifted window (Swin) and vision\ntransformer architectures that makes use of MIM on undersampled k spaces to\npredict the full k space and consequently the full MRI image. Modifications\nwere made using pytorch and numpy libraries, and were published to a github\nrepository. After the model reconstructed the k space images, the basic Fourier\ntransform was applied to determine the actual MRI image. Once the model reached\na steady state, experimentation with hyperparameters helped to achieve pinpoint\naccuracy for the reconstructed images. The model was evaluated through L1 loss,\ngradient normalization, and structural similarity values. The model produced\nreconstructed images with L1 loss values averaging to <0.01 and gradient\nnormalization values <0.1 after training finished. The reconstructed k spaces\nyielded structural similarity values of over 99% for both training and\nvalidation with the fully sampled k spaces, while validation loss continually\ndecreased under 0.01.

The\nthree-element Windkessel model is usually employed as a lumped boundary\ncondition, providing a reduced order representation of the peripheral\ncirculation. However, the systematic estimation of the Windkessel parameters\nremains an open problem. Moreover, the Windkessel model is not always adequate\nto model blood flow dynamics, which often require more elaborate boundary\nconditions. In this study, we propose a method for the estimation of high order\nboundary conditions, including the Windkessel model, and we investigate their\nuse.

    "abstract": "Although quantum supremacy is yet to come, there has recently been an\nincreasing interest in identifying the potential of quantum machine learning\n(QML) in the looming era of practical quantum computing. Motivated by this, in\nthis article we re-design multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) based on\nthe unique characteristics of quantum neural networks (QNNs) having two\nseparate dimensions of trainable parameters: angle parameters affecting the\noutput qubit states, and pole parameters associated with the output measurement\nbasis. Exploiting this dyadic trainability as meta-learning capability, we\npropose quantum meta MARL (QM2ARL) that first applies angle training for\nmeta-QNN learning, followed by pole training for few-shot or local-QNN\ntraining. To avoid overfitting, we develop an angle-to-pole regularization\ntechnique injecting noise into the pole domain during angle training.\nFurthermore, by exploiting the pole as the memory address of each trained QNN,\nwe introduce the concept of pole memory allowing one to save and load trained\nQNNs using only two-parameter pole values. We theoretically prove the\nconvergence of angle training under the angle-to-pole regularization, and by\nsimulation corroborate the effectiveness of QM2ARL in achieving high reward and\nfast convergence, as well as of the pole memory in fast adaptation to a\ntime-varying environment.",

    "abstract": "Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has a growing role in\ndetecting prostate cancer lesions. Thus, it is pertinent that medical\nprofessionals who interpret these scans reduce the risk of human error by using\ncomputer-aided detection systems. The variety of algorithms used in system\nimplementation, however, has yielded mixed results. Here we investigate the\nbest machine learning classifier for each prostate zone. We also discover\nsalient features to clarify the models' classification rationale. Of the data\nprovided, we gathered and augmented T2 weighted images and apparent diffusion\ncoefficient map images to extract first through third order statistical\nfeatures as input to machine learning classifiers. For our deep learning\nclassifier, we used a convolutional neural net (CNN) architecture for automatic\nfeature extraction and classification. The interpretability of the CNN results\nwas improved by saliency mapping to understand the classification mechanisms\nwithin. Ultimately, we concluded that effective detection of peripheral and\nanterior fibromuscular stroma (AS) lesions depended more on statistical\ndistribution features, whereas those in the transition zone (TZ) depended more\non textural features. Ensemble algorithms worked best for PZ and TZ zones,\nwhile CNNs were best in the AS zone. These classifiers can be used to validate\na radiologist's predictions and reduce inter-reader variability in patients\nsuspected to have prostate cancer.

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in\nmany medical image segmentation tasks. Many of these are based on convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs). For such methods, the encoder is the key part for\nglobal and local information extraction from input images; the extracted\nfeatures are then passed to the decoder for predicting the segmentations. In\ncontrast, several recent works show a superior performance with the use of\ntransformers, which can better model long-range spatial dependencies and\ncapture low-level details. However, transformer as sole encoder underperforms\nfor some tasks where it cannot efficiently replace the convolution based\nencoder. In this paper, we propose a model with double encoders for 3D\nbiomedical image segmentation. Our model is a U-shaped CNN augmented with an\nindependent transformer encoder. We fuse the information from the convolutional\nencoder and the transformer, and pass it to the decoder to obtain the results.\nWe evaluate our methods on three public datasets from three different\nchallenges: BTCV, MoDA and Decathlon.

NRLMSIS 2.0 provides species density, mass density, and temperature\nestimates as function of location and space weather conditions. MSIS models\nhave long been a popular choice of atmosphere model in the research and\noperations community alike, but - like many models - does not provide\nuncertainty estimates. In this work, we develop an exospheric temperature model\nbased in machine learning (ML) that can be used with NRLMSIS 2.0 to calibrate\nit relative to high-fidelity satellite density estimates. Instead of providing\npoint estimates, our model (called MSIS-UQ) outputs a distribution which is\nassessed using a metric called the calibration error score.
