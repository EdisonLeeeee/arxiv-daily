    "abstract": "Orchard automation has attracted the attention of researchers recently due to\nthe shortage of global labor force. To automate tasks in orchards such as\npruning, thinning, and harvesting, a detailed understanding of the tree\nstructure is required. However, occlusions from foliage and fruits can make it\nchallenging to predict the position of occluded trunks and branches. This work\nproposes a regression-based deep learning model, Hallucination of Occluded\nBranch Convolutional Neural Network (HOB-CNN), for tree branch position\nprediction in varying occluded conditions. We formulate tree branch position\nprediction as a regression problem towards the horizontal locations of the\nbranch along the vertical direction or vice versa. We present comparative\nexperiments on Y-shaped trees with two state-of-the-art baselines, representing\ncommon approaches to the problem. Experiments show that HOB-CNN outperform the\nbaselines at predicting branch position and shows robustness against varying\nlevels of occlusion. We further validated HOB-CNN against two different types\nof 2D trees, and HOB-CNN shows generalization across different trees and\nrobustness under different occluded conditions.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture is the mainstay of human society because it is an essential need\nfor every organism. Paddy cultivation is very significant so far as humans are\nconcerned, largely in the Asian continent, and it is one of the staple foods.\nHowever, plant diseases in agriculture lead to depletion in productivity. Plant\ndiseases are generally caused by pests, insects, and pathogens that decrease\nproductivity to a large scale if not controlled within a particular time.\nEventually, one cannot see an increase in paddy yield. Accurate and timely\nidentification of plant diseases can help farmers mitigate losses due to pests\nand diseases. Recently, deep learning techniques have been used to identify\npaddy diseases and overcome these problems. This paper implements a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) based on a model and tests a public dataset\nconsisting of 636 infrared image samples with five paddy disease classes and\none healthy class. The proposed model proficiently identified and classified\npaddy diseases of five different types and achieved an accuracy of 88.28%",

As part of this process, Sleepio captures data about the sleep\nbehaviour of the users that have consented to such data being processed. For\nneural networks, the scale of the data is an opportunity to train meaningful\nmodels translatable to actual clinical practice. In collaboration with Big\nHealth, the therapeutics company that created and utilizes Sleepio, we have\nanalysed data from a random sample of 401,174 sleep diaries and built a neural\nnetwork to model sleep behaviour and sleep quality of each individual in a\npersonalised manner.

We compare model\nperformance in a wide range of hyperparameter settings representing various\nscenarios. We further show that the neural network can be used to produce\npersonalised recommendations of what sleep habits users should follow to\nmaximise sleep quality, and show that these recommendations are substantially\nbetter than the ones generated by standard methods.

This paper investigates the\nimpacts of FRPs on the operation of interdependent electricity and natural gas\nnetworks. To accurately model and reflect the effects of variations in the\nnatural gas fuel demand on the natural gas network, a dynamic Optimal Gas Flow\n(OGF) formulation is utilized. The non-convex dynamic model of the natural gas\nsystem is represented in a convex form via a tight relaxation scheme. An\nimproved distributed optimization method is proposed to solve the coordinated\noperation problem in a privacy-preserving manner, where the two infrastructures\nonly share limited information. We introduce the Inexact Varying Alternating\nDirection Method of Multipliers (IV-ADMM) and show that compared with the\nclassic ADMM, it converges considerably faster and in fewer iterations. Through\na comparison of day-ahead and real-time operation planning results, it is\nconcluded that without accounting for natural gas network dynamics, the FRP\nmodel is not a trustworthy tool in day-ahead planning against uncertainties.",

The NFFT plays a major role in many signal\nprocessing applications and has been intensively studied from a theoretical and\ncomputational perspective. The fastest CPU implementations of the NFFT are\nimplemented in the low-level programming languages C and C++ and require a\ncompromise between code generalizability, code readability, and code\nefficiency. The programming language Julia promises new opportunities in\noptimizing these three conflicting goals.

    "abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of 4D facial expressions generation.\nThis is usually addressed by animating a neutral 3D face to reach an expression\npeak, and then get back to the neutral state. In the real world though, people\nshow more complex expressions, and switch from one expression to another. We\nthus propose a new model that generates transitions between different\nexpressions, and synthesizes long and composed 4D expressions. This involves\nthree sub-problems: (i) modeling the temporal dynamics of expressions, (ii)\nlearning transitions between them, and (iii) deforming a generic mesh. We\npropose to encode the temporal evolution of expressions using the motion of a\nset of 3D landmarks, that we learn to generate by training a manifold-valued\nGAN (Motion3DGAN). To allow the generation of composed expressions, this model\naccepts two labels encoding the starting and the ending expressions. The final\nsequence of meshes is generated by a Sparse2Dense mesh Decoder (S2D-Dec) that\nmaps the landmark displacements to a dense, per-vertex displacement of a known\nmesh topology. By explicitly working with motion trajectories, the model is\ntotally independent from the identity. Extensive experiments on five public\ndatasets show that our proposed approach brings significant improvements with\nrespect to previous solutions, while retaining good generalization to unseen\ndata.",

The aim of the presented research is to help\nfirms identify and analyze stakeholders in OSS ecosystems, in terms of their\ninfluence and interactions, to create awareness of their agendas, their\ncollaborators, and how they invest their resources. To arrive at a solution\nartifact, we applied a design science research approach where we base artifact\ndesign on the literature and earlier work.

    "abstract": "Inverse text normalization (ITN) is an essential post-processing step in\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR). It converts numbers, dates, abbreviations,\nand other semiotic classes from the spoken form generated by ASR to their\nwritten forms. One can consider ITN as a Machine Translation task and use\nneural sequence-to-sequence models to solve it. Unfortunately, such neural\nmodels are prone to hallucinations that could lead to unacceptable errors. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose a single-pass token classifier model that\nregards ITN as a tagging task.

    "abstract": "Meta reinforcement learning (meta RL), as a combination of meta-learning\nideas and reinforcement learning (RL), enables the agent to adapt to different\ntasks using a few samples. However, this sampling-based adaptation also makes\nmeta RL vulnerable to adversarial attacks. By manipulating the reward feedback\nfrom sampling processes in meta RL, an attacker can mislead the agent into\nbuilding wrong knowledge from training experience, which deteriorates the\nagent's performance when dealing with different tasks after adaptation. This\npaper provides a game-theoretical underpinning for understanding this type of\nsecurity risk. In particular, we formally define the sampling attack model as a\nStackelberg game between the attacker and the agent, which yields a minimax\nformulation. It leads to two online attack schemes: Intermittent Attack and\nPersistent Attack, which enable the attacker to learn an optimal sampling\nattack, defined by an $\\epsilon$-first-order stationary point, within\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. These attack schemes freeride the\nlearning progress concurrently without extra interactions with the environment.\nBy corroborating the convergence results with numerical experiments, we observe\nthat a minor effort of the attacker can significantly deteriorate the learning\nperformance, and the minimax approach can also help robustify the meta RL\nalgorithms.",

In fact, among other\nfeatures, it has already been shown how this technology can contribute to\nimprove transient stability in power systems by the use of supplementary\ncontrollers. Along this line, this paper will investigate in detail how these\nsupplementary controllers may affect electromechanical oscillations, by means\nof small-signal stability analysis. The paper analyses two control strategies\nbased on the modulation of active-power injections (P-WAF) and reactive-power\ninjections (Q-WAF) in the VSC stations. Both control strategies use global\nsignals of the frequencies of the VSC-MTDC system and they presented\nsignificant improvements on transient stability. The paper will provide\nguidelines for the design of these type of controllers to improve both, large-\nand small-disturbance angle stability. Small-signal stability techniques (in\nMatlab) will be used to assess electromechanical-oscillation damping, while\nnon-linear time domain simulation (in PSS/E) will be used to confirm the\nresults. Results will be illustrated in Nordic32A test system with an embedded\nVSC-MTDC system. The paper analyses the impact of the controller gains and\ncommunication latency on electromechanical-oscillation damping.

While the reliability\naspect is well known to be improved by channel coding with long codewords, this\nusually implies using interleavers, which introduce undesirable delay. Using\nshort codewords is a needed change, which will also do away with the need for\ninterleaving and minimize the decoding delay. This work proposes a coding and\ndecoding scheme that, in combination with the high spectral efficiency attained\nby spatial signal processing, can provide URLLC over a fading wireless channel.\nThe paper advocates the use of random linear codes (RLCs) over a massive MIMO\nchannel with standard zero-forcing detection and guessing random additive noise\ndecoding (GRAND). The performance of several schemes is assessed over a MIMO\nflat fading channel. The proposed scheme greatly outperforms the equivalent\nscheme using standard polar encoding and decoding for signal-to-noise ratios\n(SNR) of interest. The decoding complexity of the proposed setup is assessed\nand compared with the equivalent counterpart using the polar code in the 5G NR\n(new radio) standard. While the complexity of the polar code is constant at all\nSNRs, using RLCs with GRAND achieves much faster decoding times for most of the\nSNR range, further reducing latency.",

Specifically, if the class of policies is sufficiently\nexpressive to contain the expert policy, we prove that DAGGER achieves constant\nregret.

In order to ensure convergence for a wider class of policies\nand losses, we augment DAGGER with an additional regularization term.

Assuming that the loss functions\nare smooth and convex with respect to the parameters of the policy, we also\nprove that FTRL achieves constant regret for any sufficiently expressive policy\nclass, while retaining $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret in the worst-case.

While existing methods try to handle occlusion with pose\npriors/constraints, data augmentation, or implicit reasoning, they still fail\nto generalize to unseen poses or occlusion cases and may make large mistakes\nwhen multiple people are present. Inspired by the remarkable ability of humans\nto infer occluded joints from visible cues, we develop a method to explicitly\nmodel this process that significantly improves bottom-up multi-person human\npose estimation with or without occlusions. First, we split the task into two\nsubtasks: visible keypoints detection and occluded keypoints reasoning, and\npropose a Deeply Supervised Encoder Distillation (DSED) network to solve the\nsecond one. To train our model, we propose a Skeleton-guided human Shape\nFitting (SSF) approach to generate pseudo occlusion labels on the existing\ndatasets, enabling explicit occlusion reasoning. Experiments show that\nexplicitly learning from occlusions improves human pose estimation. In\naddition, exploiting feature-level information of visible joints allows us to\nreason about occluded joints more accurately.

The underlying cause of both is thrombi released from\nruptured or eroded unstable atherosclerotic plaques that occlude vessels in the\nheart (myocardial infarction) or the brain (stroke). Clinical studies show that\nplaque composition plays a more important role than lesion size in plaque\nrupture or erosion events. To determine the plaque composition, various cell\ntypes in 3D cardiovascular immunofluorescent images of plaque lesions are\ncounted. However, counting these cells manually is expensive, time-consuming,\nand prone to human error. These challenges of manual counting motivate the need\nfor an automated approach to localize and count the cells in images. The\npurpose of this study is to develop an automatic approach to accurately detect\nand count cells in 3D immunofluorescent images with minimal annotation effort.\nIn this study, we used a weakly supervised learning approach to train the\nHoVer-Net segmentation model using point annotations to detect nuclei in\nfluorescent images. The advantage of using point annotations is that they\nrequire less effort as opposed to pixel-wise annotation. To train the HoVer-Net\nmodel using point annotations, we adopted a popularly used cluster labeling\napproach to transform point annotations into accurate binary masks of cell\nnuclei.

    "abstract": "Understanding the behavior of software in execution is a key step in\nidentifying and fixing performance issues. This is especially important in high\nperformance computing contexts where even minor performance tweaks can\ntranslate into large savings in terms of computational resource use. To aid\nperformance analysis, developers may collect an execution trace - a\nchronological log of program activity during execution. As traces represent the\nfull history, developers can discover a wide array of possibly previously\nunknown performance issues, making them an important artifact for exploratory\nperformance analysis. However, interactive trace visualization is difficult due\nto issues of data size and complexity of meaning. Traces represent\nnanosecond-level events across many parallel processes, meaning the collected\ndata is often large and difficult to explore. The rise of asynchronous task\nparallel programming paradigms complicates the relation between events and\ntheir probable cause. To address these challenges, we conduct a continuing\ndesign study in collaboration with high performance computing researchers. We\ndevelop diverse and hierarchical ways to navigate and represent execution trace\ndata in support of their trace analysis tasks. Through an iterative design\nprocess, we developed Traveler, an integrated visualization platform for task\nparallel traces. Traveler provides multiple linked interfaces to help navigate\ntrace data from multiple contexts. We evaluate the utility of Traveler through\nfeedback from users and a case study, finding that integrating multiple modes\nof navigation in our design supported performance analysis tasks and led to the\ndiscovery of previously unknown behavior in a distributed array library.",

    "abstract": "We propose a method for estimating the 6DoF pose of a rigid object with an\navailable 3D model from a single RGB image. Unlike classical\ncorrespondence-based methods which predict 3D object coordinates at pixels of\nthe input image, the proposed method predicts 3D object coordinates at 3D query\npoints sampled in the camera frustum. The move from pixels to 3D points, which\nis inspired by recent PIFu-style methods for 3D reconstruction, enables\nreasoning about the whole object, including its (self-)occluded parts. For a 3D\nquery point associated with a pixel-aligned image feature, we train a\nfully-connected neural network to predict: (i) the corresponding 3D object\ncoordinates, and (ii) the signed distance to the object surface, with the first\ndefined only for query points in the surface vicinity. We call the mapping\nrealized by this network as Neural Correspondence Field. The object pose is\nthen robustly estimated from the predicted 3D-3D correspondences by the\nKabsch-RANSAC algorithm.

    "abstract": "Cooperative perception allows a Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) to\ninteract with the other CAVs in the vicinity to enhance perception of\nsurrounding objects to increase safety and reliability. It can compensate for\nthe limitations of the conventional vehicular perception such as blind spots,\nlow resolution, and weather effects. An effective feature fusion model for the\nintermediate fusion methods of cooperative perception can improve feature\nselection and information aggregation to further enhance the perception\naccuracy. We propose adaptive feature fusion models with trainable feature\nselection modules. One of our proposed models Spatial-wise Adaptive feature\nFusion (S-AdaFusion) outperforms all other state-of-the-art models on the two\nsubsets of OPV2V dataset: default CARLA towns for vehicle detection and the\nCulver City for domain adaptation. In addition, previous studies have only\ntested cooperative perception for vehicle detection. A pedestrian, however, is\nmuch more likely to be seriously injured in a traffic accident. We evaluate the\nperformance of cooperative perception for both vehicle and pedestrian detection\nusing the CODD dataset. Our architecture achieves higher Average Precision (AP)\nthan other existing models for both vehicle and pedestrian detection on the\nCODD dataset. The experiments demonstrate that cooperative perception also can\nimprove the pedestrian detection accuracy compared to the conventional\nperception process.",

    "abstract": "Deep Metric Learning (DML) serves to learn an embedding function to project\nsemantically similar data into nearby embedding space and plays a vital role in\nmany applications, such as image retrieval and face recognition. However, the\nperformance of DML methods often highly depends on sampling methods to choose\neffective data from the embedding space in the training. In practice, the\nembeddings in the embedding space are obtained by some deep models, where the\nembedding space is often with barren area due to the absence of training\npoints, resulting in so called \"missing embedding\" issue. This issue may impair\nthe sample quality, which leads to degenerated DML performance. In this work,\nwe investigate how to alleviate the \"missing embedding\" issue to improve the\nsampling quality and achieve effective DML. To this end, we propose a\nDensely-Anchored Sampling (DAS) scheme that considers the embedding with\ncorresponding data point as \"anchor\" and exploits the anchor's nearby embedding\nspace to densely produce embeddings without data points. Specifically, we\npropose to exploit the embedding space around single anchor with Discriminative\nFeature Scaling (DFS) and multiple anchors with Memorized Transformation\nShifting (MTS). In this way, by combing the embeddings with and without data\npoints, we are able to provide more embeddings to facilitate the sampling\nprocess thus boosting the performance of DML. Our method is effortlessly\nintegrated into existing DML frameworks and improves them without bells and\nwhistles.

Besides, the online\nlearning capacity of GPs is limited for high-dimension problems and long-term\ntasks in practice. This paper proposes a sparse online GP (SOGP) with a\nforgetting mechanism to forget distant model information at a specific rate.\nThe proposed approach combines two general data deletion schemes for the basis\nvector set of SOGP: The position information-based scheme and the oldest\npoints-based scheme.

The challenge of new task learning is often exacerbated by the\nscarcity of data for the new categories due to rarity or cost. Here we explore\nthe important task of Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) and its\nextreme data scarcity condition of one-shot. An ideal FSCIL model needs to\nperform well on all classes, regardless of their presentation order or paucity\nof data. It also needs to be robust to open-set real-world conditions and be\neasily adapted to the new tasks that always arise in the field. In this paper,\nwe first reevaluate the current task setting and propose a more comprehensive\nand practical setting for the FSCIL task. Then, inspired by the similarity of\nthe goals for FSCIL and modern face recognition systems, we propose our method\n-- Augmented Angular Loss Incremental Classification or ALICE. In ALICE,\ninstead of the commonly used cross-entropy loss, we propose to use the angular\npenalty loss to obtain well-clustered features. As the obtained features not\nonly need to be compactly clustered but also diverse enough to maintain\ngeneralization for future incremental classes, we further discuss how class\naugmentation, data augmentation, and data balancing affect classification\nperformance. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR100,\nminiImageNet, and CUB200, demonstrate the improved performance of ALICE over\nthe state-of-the-art FSCIL methods.",

However, the current approaches suffer from inconsistent shadow\npredictions across frames, especially when the illumination and background\ntextures change in a video. We make an observation that the inconsistent\npredictions are caused by the shadow feature inconsistency, i.e., the features\nof the same shadow regions show dissimilar proprieties among the nearby\nframes.In this paper, we present a novel Shadow-Consistent Correspondence\nmethod (SC-Cor) to enhance pixel-wise similarity of the specific shadow regions\nacross frames for video shadow detection. Our proposed SC-Cor has three main\nadvantages. Firstly, without requiring the dense pixel-to-pixel correspondence\nlabels, SC-Cor can learn the pixel-wise correspondence across frames in a\nweakly-supervised manner. Secondly, SC-Cor considers intra-shadow separability,\nwhich is robust to the variant textures and illuminations in videos. Finally,\nSC-Cor is a plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated into existing\nshadow detectors with no extra computational cost. We further design a new\nevaluation metric to evaluate the temporal stability of the video shadow\ndetection results. Experimental results show that SC-Cor outperforms the prior\nstate-of-the-art method, by 6.51% on IoU and 3.35% on the newly introduced\ntemporal stability metric.",

By extending the notion of the degree\nof a node via Breath-First Search, a general family of {\\bf parametric\ncentrality functions} is defined which are able to reveal the importance of\nnodes. We introduce the {\\bf neighbors degree frequency (NDF)}, as a locally\ndefined embedding of nodes of undirected graphs into euclidean spaces. This\ngives rise to a vectorized labeling of nodes which encodes the structure of\nlocal neighborhoods of nodes and can be used for graph isomorphism testing. We\nadd flexibility to our construction so that it can handle dynamic graphs as\nwell. Afterwards, the Breadth-First Search is used to extend NDF vector\nrepresentations into two different matrix representations of nodes which\ncontain higher order information about the neighborhoods of nodes. Our matrix\nrepresentations of nodes provide us with a new way of visualizing the shape of\nthe neighborhood of a node. Furthermore, we use these matrix representations to\nobtain feature vectors, which are suitable for typical deep learning\nalgorithms. To demonstrate these node embeddings actually contain some\ninformation about the nodes, in a series of examples, we show that PageRank and\ncloseness centrality can be learned by applying deep learning to these local\nfeatures.

In this\npaper, we propose to automatically designate the action distribution dispersion\nusing the following principle: This distribution should have sufficient\ndispersion to enable the evaluation of future policies. To that end, the\ndispersion should be tuned to assure a sufficiently high probability\n(densities) of the actions in the replay buffer and the modes of the\ndistributions that generated them, yet this dispersion should not be higher.\nThis way, a policy can be effectively evaluated based on the actions in the\nbuffer, but exploratory randomness in actions decreases when this policy\nconverges.

Supervised approaches have led to great success with the\nadvance of deep learning, but they rely on large quantities of ground-truth\ndepth annotations that are expensive to acquire. Unsupervised domain adaptation\n(UDA) transfers knowledge from labeled source data to unlabeled target data, so\nas to relax the constraint of supervised learning. However, existing UDA\napproaches may not completely align the domain gap across different datasets\nbecause of the domain shift problem. We believe better domain alignment can be\nachieved via well-designed feature decomposition. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel UDA method for MDE, referred to as Learning Feature Decomposition for\nAdaptation (LFDA), which learns to decompose the feature space into content and\nstyle components. LFDA only attempts to align the content component since it\nhas a smaller domain gap. Meanwhile, it excludes the style component which is\nspecific to the source domain from training the primary task. Furthermore, LFDA\nuses separate feature distribution estimations to further bridge the domain\ngap.

To deal with this difficulty,\nwe introduce a network distillation operation that separates the low rank\napproximation and the weight quantization in the network training. The\ninformation from the initial LR constrained NeRF (LR-NeRF) is distilled to a\nmodel of a much smaller dimension (DLR-NeRF) based on the TT decomposition of\nthe LR-NeRF. An optimized global codebook is then learned to quantize all TT\ncomponents, producing the final QDLRNeRF. Experimental results show that our\nproposed method yields better compression efficiency compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods, and it additionally has the advantage of allowing the\nsynthesis of any light field view with a high quality.",

    "abstract": "Spina Bifida (SB) is a birth defect developed during the early stage of\npregnancy in which there is incomplete closing of the spine around the spinal\ncord. The growing interest in fetoscopic Spina-Bifida repair, which is\nperformed in fetuses who are still in the pregnant uterus, prompts the need for\nappropriate training. The learning curve for such procedures is steep and\nrequires excellent procedural skills. Computer-based virtual reality (VR)\nsimulation systems offer a safe, cost-effective, and configurable training\nenvironment free from ethical and patient safety issues. However, to the best\nof our knowledge, there are currently no commercial or experimental VR training\nsimulation systems available for fetoscopic SB-repair procedures. In this\npaper, we propose a novel VR simulator for core manual skills training for\nSB-repair. An initial simulation realism validation study was carried out by\nobtaining subjective feedback (face and content validity) from 14 clinicians.\nThe overall simulation realism was on average marked 4.07 on a 5-point Likert\nscale (1 - very unrealistic, 5 - very realistic). Its usefulness as a training\ntool for SB-repair as well as in learning fundamental laparoscopic skills was\nmarked 4.63 and 4.80, respectively. These results indicate that VR simulation\nof fetoscopic procedures may contribute to surgical training without putting\nfetuses and their mothers at risk. It could also facilitate wider adaptation of\nfetoscopic procedures in place of much more invasive open fetal surgeries.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of robot dynamics often pertains to the hybrid nature of\ndynamics, where governing dynamic equations consist of heterogenous equations\nthat are switched depending on the state of the system. Legged robots and\nmanipulator robots experience contact-noncontact discrete transitions, causing\nswitching of governing equations. Analysis of these robot systems have been a\nchallenge due to the lack of a global, unified model that is amenable to\nanalysis of the global behaviors. Composition operator theory has the potential\nto provide a global, unified representation of those heterogenous dynamical\nsystems. It is expected that, if the theory is applicable, those fundamentally\nchallenging robotics systems can be treated as linear dynamical systems in a\nlifted space. The current work addresses under which conditions a unified\nlinear representation exists in a global sense for a class of heterogenous\ndynamical systems and how the theory can be applied to those robotics problems.\nFirst, a kernel representation of composition operators is obtained, and\nconditions required for converting the kernel representation to a linear state\ntransition equation are established. This analysis results in an algorithm to\nconvert a class of heterogenous systems including hybrid and switched systems\ndirectly to a global, unified linear model. Unlike prevalent data-driven\nmethods and Dynamic Mode Decomposition, where results can vary depending on\nnumerical data, the proposed method does not require numerical simulation of\nthe original dynamics. The implication of the new method and its impact upon\nrobotics are discussed. A few examples validate and demonstrate the method.",

    "abstract": "Diversity maximization is a fundamental problem with wide applications in\ndata summarization, web search, and recommender systems. Given a set $X$ of $n$\nelements, it asks to select a subset $S$ of $k \\ll n$ elements with maximum\n\\emph{diversity}, as quantified by the dissimilarities among the elements in\n$S$. In this paper, we focus on the diversity maximization problem with\nfairness constraints in the streaming setting. Specifically, we consider the\nmax-min diversity objective, which selects a subset $S$ that maximizes the\nminimum distance (dissimilarity) between any pair of distinct elements within\nit. Assuming that the set $X$ is partitioned into $m$ disjoint groups by some\nsensitive attribute, e.g., sex or race, ensuring \\emph{fairness} requires that\nthe selected subset $S$ contains $k_i$ elements from each group $i \\in [1,m]$.\nA streaming algorithm should process $X$ sequentially in one pass and return a\nsubset with maximum \\emph{diversity} while guaranteeing the fairness\nconstraint. Although diversity maximization has been extensively studied, the\nonly known algorithms that can work with the max-min diversity objective and\nfairness constraints are very inefficient for data streams. Since diversity\nmaximization is NP-hard in general, we propose two approximation algorithms for\nfair diversity maximization in data streams, the first of which is\n$\\frac{1-\\varepsilon}{4}$-approximate and specific for $m=2$, where\n$\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$, and the second of which achieves a\n$\\frac{1-\\varepsilon}{3m+2}$-approximation for an arbitrary $m$. Experimental\nresults on real-world and synthetic datasets show that both algorithms provide\nsolutions of comparable quality to the state-of-the-art algorithms while\nrunning several orders of magnitude faster in the streaming setting.",

    "abstract": "Key generation is a promising technique to establish symmetric keys between\nresource-constrained legitimate users. However, key generation suffers from low\nsecret key rate (SKR) in harsh environments where channel randomness is\nlimited. To address the problem, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are\nintroduced to reshape the channels by controlling massive reflecting elements,\nwhich can provide more channel diversity. In this paper, we design a channel\nprobing protocol to fully extract the randomness from the cascaded channel,\ni.e., the channel through reflecting elements. We derive the analytical\nexpressions of SKR and design a water-filling algorithm based on the\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to find the upper bound. To find the\noptimal precoding and phase shift matrices, we propose an algorithm based on\nthe Grassmann manifold optimization methods. The system is evaluated in terms\nof SKR, bit disagreement rate (BDR) and randomness. Simulation results show\nthat our protocols significantly improve the SKR as compared to existing\nprotocol.",

    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection has been extensively investigated by incorporating\nmeta-learning into region-based detection frameworks. Despite its success, the\nsaid paradigm is still constrained by several factors, such as (i) low-quality\nregion proposals for novel classes and (ii) negligence of the inter-class\ncorrelation among different classes. Such limitations hinder the generalization\nof base-class knowledge for the detection of novel-class objects. In this work,\nwe design Meta-DETR, which (i) is the first image-level few-shot detector, and\n(ii) introduces a novel inter-class correlational meta-learning strategy to\ncapture and leverage the correlation among different classes for robust and\naccurate few-shot object detection. Meta-DETR works entirely at image level\nwithout any region proposals, which circumvents the constraint of inaccurate\nproposals in prevalent few-shot detection frameworks. In addition, the\nintroduced correlational meta-learning enables Meta-DETR to simultaneously\nattend to multiple support classes within a single feedforward, which allows to\ncapture the inter-class correlation among different classes, thus significantly\nreducing the misclassification over similar classes and enhancing knowledge\ngeneralization to novel classes. Experiments over multiple few-shot object\ndetection benchmarks show that the proposed Meta-DETR outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by large margins.

Exploratory landscape analysis (ELA) subsumes a set of\ntechniques that can be used to gain knowledge about properties of unknown\noptimization problems. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of five\ndifferent black-box optimizers on 30 HPO problems, which consist of two-,\nthree- and five-dimensional continuous search spaces of the XGBoost learner\ntrained on 10 different data sets. This is contrasted with the performance of\nthe same optimizers evaluated on 360 problem instances from the black-box\noptimization benchmark (BBOB). We then compute ELA features on the HPO and BBOB\nproblems and examine similarities and differences. A cluster analysis of the\nHPO and BBOB problems in ELA feature space allows us to identify how the HPO\nproblems compare to the BBOB problems on a structural meta-level. We identify a\nsubset of BBOB problems that are close to the HPO problems in ELA feature space\nand show that optimizer performance is comparably similar on these two sets of\nbenchmark problems.

This paper presents PolarMix, a point cloud\naugmentation technique that is simple and generic but can mitigate the data\nconstraint effectively across different perception tasks and scenarios.\nPolarMix enriches point cloud distributions and preserves point cloud fidelity\nvia two cross-scan augmentation strategies that cut, edit, and mix point clouds\nalong the scanning direction. The first is scene-level swapping which exchanges\npoint cloud sectors of two LiDAR scans that are cut along the azimuth axis. The\nsecond is instance-level rotation and paste which crops point instances from\none LiDAR scan, rotates them by multiple angles (to create multiple copies),\nand paste the rotated point instances into other scans.

As such, it calls\nfor different pre-training methods for specific scenarios, and the pre-trained\nmodels are likely to be limited by their universality and representation\nquality. In this work, we extend the recently proposed MAE style pre-training\nstrategy, RetroMAE, such that it may effectively support a wide variety of\nsentence representation tasks. The extended framework consists of two stages,\nwith RetroMAE conducted throughout the process. The first stage performs\nRetroMAE over generic corpora, like Wikipedia, BookCorpus, etc., from which the\nbase model is learned. The second stage takes place on domain-specific data,\ne.g., MS MARCO and NLI, where the base model is continuingly trained based on\nRetroMAE and contrastive learning. The pre-training outputs at the two stages\nmay serve different applications, whose effectiveness are verified with\ncomprehensive experiments. Concretely, the base model are proved to be\neffective for zero-shot retrieval, with remarkable performances achieved on\nBEIR benchmark. The continuingly pre-trained models further benefit more\ndownstream tasks, including the domain-specific dense retrieval on MS MARCO,\nNatural Questions, and the sentence embeddings' quality for standard STS and\ntransfer tasks in SentEval.

    "abstract": "Performance and scalability requirements have a fundamental role in most\nlarge-scale software applications. To satisfy such requirements, caching is\noften used at various levels and infrastructure layers. Application-level\ncaching -- or memoization -- is an increasingly used form of caching within the\napplication boundaries, which consists of storing the results of computations\nin memory to avoid re-computing them. This is typically manually done by\ndevelopers, who identify caching opportunities in the code and write additional\ncode to manage the cache content. The task of identifying caching opportunities\nis a challenge because it requires the analysis of workloads and code locations\nwhere it is feasible and beneficial to cache objects. To aid developers in this\ntask, there are approaches that automatically identify cacheable methods.\nAlthough such approaches have been individually evaluated, their effectiveness\nhas not been compared. We thus in this paper present an empirical evaluation to\ncompare the method recommendations made by the two existing application-level\ncaching approaches at the method level, namely APLCache and MemoizeIt, using\nseven open-source web applications. We analyse the recommendations made by each\napproach as well as the hits, misses and throughput achieved with their valid\ncaching recommendations. Our results show that the effectiveness of both\napproaches largely depends on the specific application, the presence of invalid\nrecommendations and additional configurations, such as the time-to-live. By\ninspecting the obtained results, we observed in which cases the recommendations\nof each approach fail and succeed, which allowed us to derive a set of seven\nlessons learned that give directions for future approaches to support\ndevelopers in the adoption of this type of caching.",

    "abstract": "Retrieving the missing dimension information in acoustic images from 2D\nforward-looking sonar is a well-known problem in the field of underwater\nrobotics. There are works attempting to retrieve 3D information from a single\nimage which allows the robot to generate 3D maps with fly-through motion.\nHowever, owing to the unique image formulation principle, estimating 3D\ninformation from a single image faces severe ambiguity problems. Classical\nmethods of multi-view stereo can avoid the ambiguity problems, but may require\na large number of viewpoints to generate an accurate model. In this work, we\npropose a novel learning-based multi-view stereo method to estimate 3D\ninformation. To better utilize the information from multiple frames, an\nelevation plane sweeping method is proposed to generate the\ndepth-azimuth-elevation cost volume. The volume after regularization can be\nconsidered as a probabilistic volumetric representation of the target. Instead\nof performing regression on the elevation angles, we use pseudo front depth\nfrom the cost volume to represent the 3D information which can avoid the 2D-3D\nproblem in acoustic imaging. High-accuracy results can be generated with only\ntwo or three images. Synthetic datasets were generated to simulate various\nunderwater targets.

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of safely coordinating a team of\nsensor-equipped robots to reduce uncertainty about a dynamical process, where\nthe objective trades off information gain and energy cost. Optimizing this\ntrade-off is desirable, but leads to a non-monotone objective function in the\nset of robot trajectories. Therefore, common multi-robot planners based on\ncoordinate descent lose their performance guarantees. Furthermore, methods that\nhandle non-monotonicity lose their performance guarantees when subject to\ninter-robot collision avoidance constraints. As it is desirable to retain both\nthe performance guarantee and safety guarantee, this work proposes a\nhierarchical approach with a distributed planner that uses local search with a\nworst-case performance guarantees and a decentralized controller based on\ncontrol barrier functions that ensures safety and encourages timely arrival at\nsensing locations.

To\nthis end, this article contributes a streamlined methodology for vehicular\nmicrosimulation and discovers high performance control strategies with minimal\nmanual design. A variable-agent, multi-task approach is presented for\noptimization of vehicular Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes. The\nmethodology is experimentally validated on mixed autonomy traffic systems,\nwhere fractions of vehicles are automated; empirical improvement, typically\n15-60% over a human driving baseline, is observed in all configurations of six\ndiverse open or closed traffic systems. The study reveals numerous emergent\nbehaviors resembling wave mitigation, traffic signaling, and ramp metering.\nFinally, the emergent behaviors are analyzed to produce interpretable control\nstrategies, which are validated against the learned control strategies.",

Considering Bitcoin as an archetype for\ncryptocurrencies with high energy demand, this study takes a bottom-up approach\nby analysing statements made by Nigerian cryptocurrency users ($N = 158$)\nconcerning their perception of sustainability issues. Three main findings\nemerged: 1) Despite self-reporting as highly knowledgeable, most participants\nsignificantly underestimate the energy demand of Bitcoin. 2) Those who\naccurately assess the energy demand of Bitcoin are more likely to support\nmeasures targeting its energy demand than those who misestimate it. 3) Those\nwho support measures predominantly hold private actors responsible.

At CCS 2017, two blockchain-based\nprotocols were proposed to support the fair exchange of digital coins and a\ncertain service; namely, \"proofs of retrievability\" (PoR). In this work, we\nidentify two notable issues of these protocols, (1) waste of the seller's\nresources, and (2) real-time information leakage. To rectify these issues, we\nformally define and propose a blockchain-based generic construction called\n\"recurring contingent service payment\" (RC-S-P). RC-S-P lets a fair exchange of\ndigital coins and verifiable service occur periodically while ensuring that the\nbuyer cannot waste the seller's resources, and the parties' privacy is\npreserved. It supports arbitrary verifiable services, such as PoR, or\nverifiable computation and imposes low on-chain overheads. Also, we present a\nconcrete efficient instantiation of RC-S-P when the verifiable service is PoR.\nThe instantiation is called \"recurring contingent PoR payment\" (RC-PoR-P).

    "abstract": "In this paper, we concentrate on object-related analysis in the field of\ngeneral ontology of reality as related to software engineering (e.g., UML\nclasses). Such a venture is similar to many studies in which researchers have\nenhanced modeling through ontological analysis of the underlying paradigm of\nUML models. We attempt to develop a conceptual model that consists of a\nfoundation of things that is supplemented with a second level of designated\nobjects. According to some researchers, the problem of the difference between\nthings and objects is one of the most decisive issues for the conception of\nreality. In software engineering, objects serve two purposes: they promote\nunderstanding of the real world and provide a practical basis for computer\nimplementation. The notion of object plays a central role in the\nobject-oriented approach, in which other notions are viewed by decomposing them\ninto objects and their relationships. This paper contributes to the\nestablishment of a broader understanding of the notion of object in conceptual\nmodeling based on things that are simultaneously machines. In this study, we\nexplored the underlying hypothesis of conceptual models (e.g., UML) to enhance\ntheir ontological analysis by using the thing/machine (TM) model, which\npresents the domain as thimacs. Following the philosophical distinction between\nthings and objects, we can specify modeling at two levels: the thinging stage\nand the objectification stage. Objects are thimacs that control the\nhandleablity of their sub-parts when interacting with the outside of the object\n(analogous to the body parts holding together in an assemblage when interacting\nwith the outside). The results promise a more refined modeling process to\ndevelop a high-level description of the involved domain.",

Data was collected through semi-structured\ninterviews, and in one of the cases through a prolonged engagement. The data\nwas then coded using a set of \\textit{apriori} codes. Results: The study\ndescriptively presents each case based on the coding, along with synthesis in\nthe form of a conceptual model that highlights different attributes of OGD\necosystems. For example, we observe how collaboration can be enabled through\ndifferent types of ownership of the platform provider, how the ecosystem's\nscope can vary, what roles the platform provider may undertake, how to enable\nopen collaboration, and how to collaborate in terms of data sharing, OSS\ndevelopment, and standards.

Instead of training on the entire\ndataset, learning with a small synthetic dataset becomes an efficient solution.\nExtensive research has been explored in the direction of dataset condensation,\namong which gradient matching achieves state-of-the-art performance. The\ngradient matching method directly targets the training dynamics by matching the\ngradient when training on the original and synthetic datasets.

Shortest path\nalgorithms are commonly applied to modern navigation systems, so our study aims\nto improve the efficiency of an existing algorithm on large-scale Euclidean\nnetworks. The current literature lacks a deep understanding of certain\nalgorithms' performance on these types of networks. Therefore, we incorporate a\nnew heuristic function, called the $k$-step look-ahead, into the A* search\nalgorithm and conduct a computational experiment to evaluate and compare the\nresults on road networks of varying sizes.

Future research\ncan build upon this work by implementing a program that automatically chooses\nan optimal $k$ value given an input network.

This\ncan be resolved by adjusting the robot's locomotion by switching to more\nconservative and stable locomotion modes, such as crawl mode (where three feet\nare in contact with the ground always) or amble mode (where one foot touches\ndown at a time) to prevent potential falls. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose an approach to learn a model from past robot experience for predictive\ndetection of potential failures. Accordingly, we trigger gait switching merely\nbased on proprioceptive sensory information. To learn this predictive model, we\npropose a semi-supervised process for detecting and annotating ground truth\nslip events in two stages: We first detect abnormal occurrences in the time\nseries sequences of the gait data using an unsupervised anomaly detector, and\nthen, the anomalies are verified with expert human knowledge in a replay\nsimulation to assert the event of a slip. These annotated slip events are then\nused as ground truth examples to train an ensemble decision learner for\npredicting slip probabilities across terrains for traversability. We analyze\nour model on data recorded by a legged robot on multiple sites with slippery\nterrain. We demonstrate that a potential slip event can be predicted up to 720\nms ahead of a potential fall with an average precision greater than 0.95 and an\naverage F-score of 0.82.

However, the deployment of these innovative\nmodels and optimization techniques introduces possible reliability issues,\nwhich is a pillar for DNNs to be widely used in safety-critical applications,\ne.g., autonomous driving. Moreover, scaling technology nodes have the\nassociated risk of multiple faults happening at the same time, a possibility\nnot addressed in state-of-the-art resiliency analyses.\nTowards better reliability analysis for DNNs, we present enpheeph, a Fault\nInjection Framework for Spiking and Compressed DNNs. The enpheeph framework\nenables optimized execution on specialized hardware devices, e.g., GPUs, while\nproviding complete customizability to investigate different fault models,\nemulating various reliability constraints and use-cases. Hence, the faults can\nbe executed on SNNs as well as compressed networks with minimal-to-none\nmodifications to the underlying code, a feat that is not achievable by other\nstate-of-the-art tools.\nTo evaluate our enpheeph framework, we analyze the resiliency of different\nDNN and SNN models, with different compression techniques. By injecting a\nrandom and increasing number of faults, we show that DNNs can show a reduction\nin accuracy with a fault rate as low as 7 x 10 ^ (-7) faults per parameter,\nwith an accuracy drop higher than 40%. Run-time overhead when executing\nenpheeph is less than 20% of the baseline execution time when executing 100 000\nfaults concurrently, at least 10x lower than state-of-the-art frameworks,\nmaking enpheeph future-proof for complex fault injection scenarios.\nWe release enpheeph at https://github.com/Alexei95/enpheeph.",

We introduce three state-based reasoning tasks that test for the ability\nto infer when a state is entailed by a story, revise a story for a\ncounterfactual state, and to explain the most likely state change given a\nrevised story. Our benchmarking experiments show that while today's LLMs are\nable to reason about states to some degree, there is a large room for\nimprovement, suggesting potential avenues for future research.",

    "abstract": "This paper gives an introduction to Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems\nin known and unknown environments from the perspective of convex optimisation.\nIt first recalls results in the known parameter case, and develops\nunderstanding through different proofs. It then focuses on the unknown\nparameter case, where it studies extended value iteration (EVI) operators. This\nincludes the existing operators used in Rosenberg et al. [26] and Tarbouriech\net al. [31] based on the l-1 norm and supremum norm, as well as defining EVI\noperators corresponding to other norms and divergences, such as the\nKL-divergence. This paper shows in general how the EVI operators relate to\nconvex programs, and the form of their dual, where strong duality is exhibited.\nThis paper then focuses on whether the bounds from finite horizon research of\nNeu and Pike-Burke [21] can be applied to these extended value iteration\noperators in the SSP setting. It shows that similar bounds to [21] for these\noperators exist, however they lead to operators that are not in general\nmonotone and have more complex convergence properties. In a special case we\nobserve oscillating behaviour. This paper generates open questions on how\nresearch may progress, with several examples that require further examination.",

    "abstract": "In today's era of smart cyber-physical systems, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)\nhave become ubiquitous due to their state-of-the-art performance in complex\nreal-world applications. The high computational complexity of these networks,\nwhich translates to increased energy consumption, is the foremost obstacle\ntowards deploying large DNNs in resource-constrained systems. Fixed-Point (FP)\nimplementations achieved through post-training quantization are commonly used\nto curtail the energy consumption of these networks. However, the uniform\nquantization intervals in FP restrict the bit-width of data structures to large\nvalues due to the need to represent most of the numbers with sufficient\nresolution and avoid high quantization errors. In this paper, we leverage the\nkey insight that (in most of the scenarios) DNN weights and activations are\nmostly concentrated near zero and only a few of them have large magnitudes. We\npropose CoNLoCNN, a framework to enable energy-efficient low-precision deep\nconvolutional neural network inference by exploiting: (1) non-uniform\nquantization of weights enabling simplification of complex multiplication\noperations; and (2) correlation between activation values enabling partial\ncompensation of quantization errors at low cost without any run-time overheads.\nTo significantly benefit from non-uniform quantization, we also propose a novel\ndata representation format, Encoded Low-Precision Binary Signed Digit, to\ncompress the bit-width of weights while ensuring direct use of the encoded\nweight for processing using a novel multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) unit design.",

How to develop and integrate new analysis conveniently? How to\nmanage multiple analyses?\nTo answer these questions, in this work, we discuss the design trade-offs for\nthe crucial components of a static analysis framework, and argue for the most\nappropriate design by following the HBDC (Harnessing the Best Designs of\nClassics) principle: for each crucial component, we compare the design choices\nmade for it (possibly) by different classic frameworks such as Soot, WALA,\nSpotBugs and Doop, and choose arguably the best one, but if none is good\nenough, we then propose a better design. These selected or newly proposed\ndesigns finally constitute Tai-e, a new static analysis framework for Java.\nSpecifically, Tai-e is novel in the designs of several aspects like IR, pointer\nanalysis and development of new analyses, etc., leading to an easy-to-learn,\neasy-to-use and efficient system.

Up to now, there\nare few studies on multimodal conversational emotion recognition. Since Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) possess the powerful capacity of relational modeling,\nthey have an inherent advantage in the field of multimodal learning. Multimodal\ndata can be modeled as a graph, where each data object is regarded as a node,\nand both intra- and inter-modal dependencies existing between data objects can\nbe regarded as edges. GNNs leverage the graph constructed from multimodal data\nto perform intra- and inter-modal information interaction, which effectively\nfacilitates the integration and complementation of multimodal data. In this\nwork, we propose a novel Graph attention based Multimodal Fusion Technique\n(GraphMFT) for emotion recognition in conversation. GraphMFT utilizes multiple\ngraph attention networks improved to capture intra-modal contextual information\nand inter-modal complementary information. In addition, the proposed GraphMFT\nattempts to address the challenges of existing graph-based multimodal ERC\nmodels such as MMGCN. Empirical results on two public multimodal datasets\nreveal that our model outperforms the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) approachs with\nthe accuracies of 67.90% and 61.30%.",

    "abstract": "Differential signaling is a method of data transmission that uses two\ncomplementary electrical signals to encode information. This allows a receiver\nto reject any noise by looking at the difference between the two signals,\nassuming the noise affects both signals in the same way. Many protocols such as\nUSB, Ethernet, and HDMI use differential signaling to achieve a robust\ncommunication channel in a noisy environment. This generally works well and has\nled many to believe that it is infeasible to remotely inject attacking signals\ninto such a differential pair. In this paper we challenge this assumption and\nshow that an adversary can in fact inject malicious signals from a distance,\npurely using common-mode injection, i.e., injecting into both wires at the same\ntime. We show how this allows an attacker to inject bits or even arbitrary\nmessages into a communication line. Such an attack is a significant threat to\nmany applications, from home security and privacy to automotive systems,\ncritical infrastructure, or implantable medical devices; in which incorrect\ndata or unauthorized control could cause significant damage, or even fatal\naccidents.\nWe show in detail the principles of how an electromagnetic signal can bypass\nthe noise rejection of differential signaling, and eventually result in\nincorrect bits in the receiver. We show how an attacker can exploit this to\nachieve a successful injection of an arbitrary bit, and we analyze the success\nrate of injecting longer arbitrary messages. We demonstrate the attack on a\nreal system and show that the success rate can reach as high as $90\\%$.\nFinally, we present a case study where we wirelessly inject a message into a\nController Area Network (CAN) bus, which is a differential signaling bus\nprotocol used in many critical applications, including the automotive and\naviation sector.",

Thus far to our best\nknowledge, no solution exists priori to this work, despite its high prevalence\nin practice. Two globally decentralized adaptive control schemes are presented\nbased on the backstepping technique, the first one is developed in a continuous\nfashion by combining the philosophy of the modified congelation of variables\nbased approach with the special treatment of non-triangular structural\nuncertainties, which avoids the derivative of time-varying parameters and\neliminates the limitation of the triangular condition, thus largely broadens\nthe scope of application. By making use of the important property that the\npartial derivatives of the constructed virtual controllers in each subsystem\nare all constant, the second scheme is developed through directly replacing the\nstates in the preceding scheme with the triggered ones. Consequently, the\nnon-differentiability of the virtual control stemming from intermittent state\nfeedback is completely obviated. The internal signals under both schemes are\nrigorously shown to be globally uniformly bounded with the aid of several novel\nlemmas, while the stabilization performance can be enhanced by appropriately\nadjusting design parameters. Moreover, the inter-event intervals are ensured to\nbe lower-bounded by a positive constant. Finally, numerical simulation verifies\nthe benefits and efficiency of the proposed method.",

Specifically, we adopt a Transformer module to memorize & process\nthe reasoning state and a Reinforcement Learning strategy to dynamically infer\nthe reasoning steps. The work achieves the state-of-the-art performance or\nsignificant improvements on several REC datasets, ranging from RefCOCO (+, g)\nwith short expressions, to Ref-Reasoning, a dataset with long and complex\ncompositional expressions.",

    "abstract": "The Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) method is one of the most popular\nhydroponic cultivation methods. This method has advantages such as easier\nmaintenance, faster and optimal plant growth, better use of fertilizers, and\nless deposition. The disadvantages of NFT include the consumption of electrical\npower and the faster spread of disease. Therefore, NFT requires a good nutrient\ncontrol and monitoring system to save electricity and achieve optimal growth\nand resistance to pests and diseases. In this study, a nutrient control was\ndesigned with indicators of pH and TDS levels and equipped with an Internet of\nThings (IoT) based monitoring system. The control system used is the Mamdani\nFuzzy Inference System. The output of the system is the active time of the pH\nUp, pH Down, and AB Mix nutrient pumps, which aim to normalize the pH and TDS\nof nutrient liquids. The experimental results show that one to three control\nsteps are needed to normalize pH. One control step has a response time of 60\nseconds, and it can prevent pH Up and pH Down oscillations. As for TDS control,\nthe prediction of AB mix pump active time works accurately, and TDS levels can\nbe normalized in one control step. Overall, based on surface control,\nsimulations, and real experimental data, it is indicated that the control\nsystem operates very well and can normalize pH and TDS to the desired normal\nstandard.",

    "abstract": "Graph convolutional network based methods that model the body-joints'\nrelations, have recently shown great promise in 3D skeleton-based human motion\nprediction. However, these methods have two critical issues: first, deep graph\nconvolutions filter features within only limited graph spectrums, losing\nsufficient information in the full band; second, using a single graph to model\nthe whole body underestimates the diverse patterns on various body-parts. To\naddress the first issue, we propose adaptive graph scattering, which leverages\nmultiple trainable band-pass graph filters to decompose pose features into\nricher graph spectrum bands. To address the second issue, body-parts are\nmodeled separately to learn diverse dynamics, which enables finer feature\nextraction along the spatial dimensions. Integrating the above two designs, we\npropose a novel skeleton-parted graph scattering network (SPGSN). The cores of\nthe model are cascaded multi-part graph scattering blocks (MPGSBs), building\nadaptive graph scattering on diverse body-parts, as well as fusing the\ndecomposed features based on the inferred spectrum importance and body-part\ninteractions. Extensive experiments have shown that SPGSN outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by remarkable margins of 13.8%, 9.3% and 2.7% in terms\nof 3D mean per joint position error (MPJPE) on Human3.6M, CMU Mocap and 3DPW\ndatasets, respectively.",

We then\nreview existing datasets and propose the user-object-attention level (UOAL)\ndataset that contains the ground truth attention of 30 users to 96 objects in\n1,000 images. A tutorial on how to use UOAL is presented.

Lower power leads to less energy consumption in a given time\nsegment. Thus, power control for APs is essential for reducing energy\nconsumption. Our objective is to determine the power assignment for each AP\nwith same capacity constraints such that all TDs are covered, and the total\npower is minimized.

They can be used in applications where either\nthe data can be modified (collaborative work), or the data must be modified\n(redactable and content extraction signatures) or we need to know which parts\nof the data have been modified (data forensics). A \\new{classical} digital\nsignature is valid for a message only if the signature is authentic and not\neven one bit of the message has been modified. We propose a general framework\nof modification tolerant signature schemes (MTSS), which can provide either\nlocation only or both location and correction, for modifications in a signed\nmessage divided into $n$ blocks. This general scheme uses a set of allowed\nmodifications that must be specified. We present an instantiation of MTSS with\na tolerance level of $d$, indicating modifications can appear in any set of up\nto $d$ message blocks. This tolerance level $d$ is needed in practice for\nparametrizing and controlling the growth of the signature size with respect to\nthe number $n$ of blocks; using combinatorial group testing (CGT) the signature\nhas size $O(d^2 \\log n)$ which is close to the \\new{best known} lower bound\n\\new{of $\\Omega(\\frac{d^2}{\\log d} (\\log n))$}.

To address these defects, the optimal multicast routing problem in\nsoftware-defined networking (SDN) is tailored as a multi-objective optimization\nproblem, and an intelligent multicast routing algorithm DRL-M4MR based on the\ndeep Q network (DQN) deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method is designed to\nconstruct a multicast tree in SDN. First, the multicast tree state matrix, link\nbandwidth matrix, link delay matrix, and link packet loss rate matrix are\ndesigned as the state space of the DRL agent by combining the global view and\ncontrol of the SDN. Second, the action space of the agent is all the links in\nthe network, and the action selection strategy is designed to add the links to\nthe current multicast tree under four cases. Third, single-step and final\nreward function forms are designed to guide the intelligence to make decisions\nto construct the optimal multicast tree. The experimental results show that,\ncompared with existing algorithms, the multicast tree construct by DRL-M4MR can\nobtain better bandwidth, delay, and packet loss rate performance after\ntraining, and it can make more intelligent multicast routing decisions in a\ndynamic network environment.",

Recent advances in\ncomputer vision and image segmentation enable automatising DFI blood vessel\nsegmentation. There is a need for a resource that can automatically compute\ndigital vasculature biomarkers (VBM) from these segmented DFI. Methods: In this\npaper, we introduce a Python Vasculature BioMarker toolbox, denoted PVBM. A\ntotal of 11 VBMs were implemented.

    "abstract": "Spiking neural network (SNN) is a brain-inspired model which has more\nspatio-temporal information processing capacity and computational energy\nefficiency. However, with the increasing depth of SNNs, the memory problem\ncaused by the weights of SNNs has gradually attracted attention. Inspired by\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs) quantization technology, binarized SNN (BSNN)\nis introduced to solve the memory problem. Due to the lack of suitable learning\nalgorithms, BSNN is usually obtained by ANN-to-SNN conversion, whose accuracy\nwill be limited by the trained ANNs. In this paper, we propose an ultra-low\nlatency adaptive local binary spiking neural network (ALBSNN) with accuracy\nloss estimators, which dynamically selects the network layers to be binarized\nto ensure the accuracy of the network by evaluating the error caused by the\nbinarized weights during the network learning process. Experimental results\nshow that this method can reduce storage space by more than 20 % without losing\nnetwork accuracy. At the same time, in order to accelerate the training speed\nof the network, the global average pooling(GAP) layer is introduced to replace\nthe fully connected layers by the combination of convolution and pooling, so\nthat SNNs can use a small number of time steps to obtain better recognition\naccuracy. In the extreme case of using only one time step, we still can achieve\n92.92 %, 91.63 % ,and 63.54 % testing accuracy on three different datasets,\nFashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The ability of pretrained Transformers to remember factual knowledge is\nessential for knowledge-intense downstream tasks such as closed-book question\nanswering. Existing work has shown that pretrained Transformers can recall or\nleverage factual knowledge that appears in the pretraining corpus to some\ndegree. However, due to the limit of the model capacity, the ability of\npretrained models to remember factual knowledge is also limited. Dai et al.\n(2022) find that the Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in pretrained Transformers\nstore factual knowledge in a memory-like manner. Inspired by this finding, we\npropose a Neural Knowledge Bank (NKB) to store extra factual knowledge for\npretrained Transformers. To be specific, we also regard FFNs as key-value\nmemories, and extend them with additional memory slots. During knowledge\ninjection, we fix the original model and inject factual knowledge into the\nextended memory slots, so there will be no catastrophic forgetting for the\npretrained model. In addition, the view of FFNs as key-value memories makes the\nNKB highly interpretable. We use three closed-book question answering datasets\nto show our strong ability to store extra factual knowledge. Also, we prove\nthat the NKB will not degrade the general language generation ability of\npretrained models through two representative generation tasks, summarization\nand machine translation. Further, we thoroughly analyze the NKB to reveal its\nworking mechanism and present the meaning of its keys and values in a\nhuman-readable way. On top of it, we perform a preliminary attempt to directly\nupdate the factual knowledge in the NKB without any additional training.",

    "abstract": "Recently deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in\nreal-world image super-resolution (SR). However, adversarial image samples with\nquasi-imperceptible noises could threaten deep learning SR models. In this\npaper, we propose a robust deep learning framework for real-world SR that\nrandomly erases potential adversarial noises in the frequency domain of input\nimages or features. The rationale is that on the SR task clean images or\nfeatures have a different pattern from the attacked ones in the frequency\ndomain. Observing that existing adversarial attacks usually add high-frequency\nnoises to input images, we introduce a novel random frequency mask module that\nblocks out high-frequency components possibly containing the harmful\nperturbations in a stochastic manner. Since the frequency masking may not only\ndestroys the adversarial perturbations but also affects the sharp details in a\nclean image, we further develop an adversarial sample classifier based on the\nfrequency domain of images to determine if applying the proposed mask module.\nBased on the above ideas, we devise a novel real-world image SR framework that\ncombines the proposed frequency mask modules and the proposed adversarial\nclassifier with an existing super-resolution backbone network. Experiments show\nthat our proposed method is more insensitive to adversarial attacks and\npresents more stable SR results than existing models and defenses.",

Given that the factors giving rise to CS\nvary from one country to the other, as well as from one person to the other, CS\nis found to be a speaker-dependant behaviour, where the frequency by which the\nforeign language is embedded differs across speakers.

    "abstract": "Artistic text recognition is an extremely challenging task with a wide range\nof applications. However, current scene text recognition methods mainly focus\non irregular text while have not explored artistic text specifically. The\nchallenges of artistic text recognition include the various appearance with\nspecial-designed fonts and effects, the complex connections and overlaps\nbetween characters, and the severe interference from background patterns. To\nalleviate these problems, we propose to recognize the artistic text at three\nlevels. Firstly, corner points are applied to guide the extraction of local\nfeatures inside characters, considering the robustness of corner structures to\nappearance and shape. In this way, the discreteness of the corner points cuts\noff the connection between characters, and the sparsity of them improves the\nrobustness for background interference. Secondly, we design a character\ncontrastive loss to model the character-level feature, improving the feature\nrepresentation for character classification. Thirdly, we utilize Transformer to\nlearn the global feature on image-level and model the global relationship of\nthe corner points, with the assistance of a corner-query cross-attention\nmechanism. Besides, we provide an artistic text dataset to benchmark the\nperformance. Experimental results verify the significant superiority of our\nproposed method on artistic text recognition and also achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on several blurred and perspective datasets.",

It then calculates the semantic\ndifference between the original image and the synthesized one for OOD\ndetection. Compared to existing solutions, MoodCat naturally learns the\nsemantic information of the in-distribution data with the proposed mask and\nconditional synthesis strategy, which is critical to identifying OODs.\nExperimental results demonstrate that MoodCat outperforms state-of-the-art OOD\ndetection solutions by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "With the development of generative-based self-supervised learning (SSL)\napproaches like BeiT and MAE, how to learn good representations by masking\nrandom patches of the input image and reconstructing the missing information\nhas grown in concern. However, BeiT and PeCo need a \"pre-pretraining\" stage to\nproduce discrete codebooks for masked patches representing. MAE does not\nrequire a pre-training codebook process, but setting pixels as reconstruction\ntargets may introduce an optimization gap between pre-training and downstream\ntasks that good reconstruction quality may not always lead to the high\ndescriptive capability for the model. Considering the above issues, in this\npaper, we propose a simple Self-distillated masked AutoEncoder network, namely\nSdAE. SdAE consists of a student branch using an encoder-decoder structure to\nreconstruct the missing information, and a teacher branch producing latent\nrepresentation of masked tokens. We also analyze how to build good views for\nthe teacher branch to produce latent representation from the perspective of\ninformation bottleneck. After that, we propose a multi-fold masking strategy to\nprovide multiple masked views with balanced information for boosting the\nperformance, which can also reduce the computational complexity. Our approach\ngeneralizes well: with only 300 epochs pre-training, a vanilla ViT-Base model\nachieves an 84.1% fine-tuning accuracy on ImageNet-1k classification, 48.6 mIOU\non ADE20K segmentation, and 48.9 mAP on COCO detection, which surpasses other\nmethods by a considerable margin.

The Minkowski sum of\ntwo multisets A and B is a multiset containing all possible sums of any element\nof A and any element of B. This problem was proved to be NP-complete when\nmultisets are replaced by sets. This version of the problem is strictly related\nto the factorization of boolean polynomials that turns out to be NP-complete as\nwell.

The\ncomputational complexity of both these problems is still unknown.\nThe main contribution of this paper is a heuristic technique for decomposing\nmultisets of non-negative integers. Experimental results show that our\nheuristic decomposes multisets of hundreds of elements within seconds\nindependently of the magnitude of numbers belonging to the multisets.

    "title": "Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit",
    "abstract": "This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.",

    "abstract": "Timber and forest products made from wood, like furniture, are valuable\ncommodities, and like the global trade of many highly-valued natural resources,\nface challenges of corruption, fraud, and illegal harvesting. These grey and\nblack market activities in the wood and forest products sector are not limited\nto the countries where the wood was harvested, but extend throughout the global\nsupply chain and have been tied to illicit financial flows, like trade-based\nmoney laundering, document fraud, species mislabeling, and other illegal\nactivities. The task of finding such fraudulent activities using trade data, in\nthe absence of ground truth, can be modelled as an unsupervised anomaly\ndetection problem. However existing approaches suffer from certain shortcomings\nin their applicability towards large scale trade data. Trade data is\nheterogeneous, with both categorical and numerical attributes in a tabular\nformat. The overall challenge lies in the complexity, volume and velocity of\ndata, with large number of entities and lack of ground truth labels. To\nmitigate these, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection --\nContrastive Learning based Heterogeneous Anomaly Detection (CHAD) that is\ngenerally applicable for large-scale heterogeneous tabular data. We demonstrate\nour model CHAD performs favorably against multiple comparable baselines for\npublic benchmark datasets, and outperforms them in the case of trade data. More\nimportantly we demonstrate our approach reduces assumptions and efforts\nrequired hyperparameter tuning, which is a key challenging aspect in an\nunsupervised training paradigm. Specifically, our overarching objective\npertains to detecting suspicious timber shipments and patterns using Bill of\nLading trade record data. Detecting anomalous transactions in shipment records\ncan enable further investigation by government agencies and supply chain\nconstituents.",

In addition, during many learning and\nexploration tasks, people need to externalize their mental context, such as\nestimating how urgent a topic is to follow up on, or rating a piece of evidence\nas a \"pro\" or \"con,\" which helps scaffold subsequent deeper exploration.\nHowever, current approaches incur a high cost, often requiring users to select,\ncopy, context switch, paste, and annotate information in a separate document\nwithout offering specific affordances that capture their mental context. In\nthis work, we explore a new interaction technique called \"wiggling,\" which can\nbe used to fluidly collect, organize, and rate information during early\nsensemaking stages with a single gesture. Wiggling involves rapid\nback-and-forth movements of a pointer or up-and-down scrolling on a smartphone,\nwhich can indicate the information to be collected and its valence, using a\nsingle, light-weight gesture that does not interfere with other interactions\nthat are already available. Through implementation and user evaluation, we\nfound that wiggling helped participants accurately collect information and\nencode their mental context with a 58% reduction in operational cost while\nbeing 24% faster compared to a common baseline.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants have become the\ndominant methods in the large-scale optimization of machine learning (ML)\nproblems. A variety of strategies have been proposed for tuning the step sizes,\nranging from adaptive step sizes to heuristic methods to change the step size\nin each iteration. Also, momentum has been widely employed in ML tasks to\naccelerate the training process. Yet, there is a gap in our theoretical\nunderstanding of them. In this work, we start to close this gap by providing\nformal guarantees to a few heuristic optimization methods and proposing\nimproved algorithms.\nFirst, we analyze a generalized version of the AdaGrad (Delayed AdaGrad) step\nsizes in both convex and non-convex settings, showing that these step sizes\nallow the algorithms to automatically adapt to the level of noise of the\nstochastic gradients. We show for the first time sufficient conditions for\nDelayed AdaGrad to achieve almost sure convergence of the gradients to zero.\nMoreover, we present a high probability analysis for Delayed AdaGrad and its\nmomentum variant in the non-convex setting.\nSecond, we analyze SGD with exponential and cosine step sizes, which are\nempirically successful but lack theoretical support. We provide the very first\nconvergence guarantees for them in the smooth and non-convex setting, with and\nwithout the Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition. We also show their good\nproperty of adaptivity to noise under the PL condition.\nThird, we study the last iterate of momentum methods. We prove the first\nlower bound in the convex setting for the last iterate of SGD with constant\nmomentum. Moreover, we investigate a class of\nFollow-The-Regularized-Leader-based momentum algorithms with increasing\nmomentum and shrinking updates.

Data is collected through interviews, document studies, and\nprolonged engagement.\nResults: Findings highlight a fear among developers of being publicly\nquestioned for their work, as they represent a government agency undergoing\nconstant scrutiny. Issue trackers, roadmaps, and development processes are\ngenerally closed, while multiple channels are used for communication, causing\ninternal and external confusion.

One\nthread of work focuses on training bi-encoder models (i.e., dense retrievers)\nto effectively encode sentences or passages into single-vector dense vectors\nfor efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. However, recent work\nhas demonstrated that transformers pre-trained with mask language modeling\n(MLM) are not capable of effectively aggregating text information into a single\ndense vector due to task-mismatch between pre-training and fine-tuning.\nTherefore, computationally expensive techniques have been adopted to train\ndense retrievers, such as large batch size, knowledge distillation or post\npre-training.

In the context of\nautonomous driving, deep neural networks have been successfully applied to\nlearning predictive models of human driving behavior from data.

    "abstract": "The boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis L.) is a serious pest that primarily\nfeeds on cotton plants. In places like Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, due to\nsub-tropical climatic conditions, cotton plants can grow year-round and\ntherefore the left-over seeds from the previous season during harvest can\ncontinue to grow in the middle of rotation crops like corn (Zea mays L.) and\nsorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). These feral or volunteer cotton (VC) plants when\nreach the pinhead squaring phase (5-6 leaf stage) can act as hosts for the boll\nweevil pest. The Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Program (TBWEP) employs people\nto locate and eliminate VC plants growing by the side of roads or fields with\nrotation crops but the ones growing in the middle of fields remain undetected.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate the application of computer vision (CV) algorithm\nbased on You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) for detecting VC plants growing\nin the middle of corn fields at three different growth stages (V3, V6, and VT)\nusing unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) remote sensing imagery. All the four\nvariants of YOLOv5 (s, m, l, and x) were used and their performances were\ncompared based on classification accuracy, mean average precision (mAP), and\nF1-score. It was found that YOLOv5s could detect VC plants with a maximum\nclassification accuracy of 98% and mAP of 96.3 % at the V6 stage of corn while\nYOLOv5s and YOLOv5m resulted in the lowest classification accuracy of 85% and\nYOLOv5m and YOLOv5l had the least mAP of 86.5% at the VT stage on images of\nsize 416 x 416 pixels. The developed CV algorithm has the potential to\neffectively detect and locate VC plants growing in the middle of corn fields as\nwell as expedite the management aspects of TBWEP.",

    "abstract": "Processing 3D data efficiently has always been a challenge. Spatial\noperations on large-scale point clouds, stored as sparse data, require extra\ncost. Attracted by the success of transformers, researchers are using\nmulti-head attention for vision tasks. However, attention calculations in\ntransformers come with quadratic complexity in the number of inputs and miss\nspatial intuition on sets like point clouds. We redesign set transformers in\nthis work and incorporate them into a hierarchical framework for shape\nclassification and part and scene segmentation. We propose our local attention\nunit, which captures features in a spatial neighborhood. We also compute\nefficient and dynamic global cross attentions by leveraging sampling and\ngrouping at each iteration. Finally, to mitigate the non-heterogeneity of point\nclouds, we propose an efficient Multi-Scale Tokenization (MST), which extracts\nscale-invariant tokens for attention operations. The proposed hierarchical\nmodel achieves state-of-the-art shape classification in mean accuracy and\nyields results on par with the previous segmentation methods while requiring\nsignificantly fewer computations. Our proposed architecture predicts\nsegmentation labels with around half the latency and parameter count of the\nprevious most efficient method with comparable performance.

Many attacks and defenses have been proposed\nover the last couple of years. The problem, however, remains largely unsolved\nand poorly understood. Here, I argue that the current formulation of the\nproblem serves short term goals, and needs to be revised for us to achieve\nbigger gains. Specifically, the bound on perturbation has created a somewhat\ncontrived setting and needs to be relaxed. This has misled us to focus on model\nclasses that are not expressive enough to begin with. Instead, inspired by\nhuman vision and the fact that we rely more on robust features such as shape,\nvertices, and foreground objects than non-robust features such as texture,\nefforts should be steered towards looking for significantly different classes\nof models. Maybe instead of narrowing down on imperceptible adversarial\nperturbations, we should attack a more general problem which is finding\narchitectures that are simultaneously robust to perceptible perturbations,\ngeometric transformations (e.g. rotation, scaling), image distortions\n(lighting, blur), and more (e.g. occlusion, shadow).

    "abstract": "Unsupervised generation of clothed virtual humans with various appearance and\nanimatable poses is important for creating 3D human avatars and other AR/VR\napplications. Existing methods are either limited to rigid object modeling, or\nnot generative and thus unable to synthesize high-quality virtual humans and\nanimate them. In this work, we propose AvatarGen, the first method that enables\nnot only non-rigid human generation with diverse appearance but also full\ncontrol over poses and viewpoints, while only requiring 2D images for training.\nSpecifically, it extends the recent 3D GANs to clothed human generation by\nutilizing a coarse human body model as a proxy to warp the observation space\ninto a standard avatar under a canonical space. To model non-rigid dynamics, it\nintroduces a deformation network to learn pose-dependent deformations in the\ncanonical space. To improve geometry quality of the generated human avatars, it\nleverages signed distance field as geometric representation, which allows more\ndirect regularization from the body model on the geometry learning. Benefiting\nfrom these designs, our method can generate animatable human avatars with\nhigh-quality appearance and geometry modeling, significantly outperforming\nprevious 3D GANs. Furthermore, it is competent for many applications, e.g.,\nsingle-view reconstruction, reanimation, and text-guided synthesis. Code and\npre-trained model will be available.",

In the existing\nworks on this subject, researchers have intensively focused on watermarking\nrobustness, while fidelity, which is concerned with the original functionality,\nhas received less attention. In this paper, we show that the existing shared\nnotion of the sole measurement of learning accuracy is insufficient to\ncharacterize backdoor fidelity. Meanwhile, we show that the analogous concept\nof embedding distortion in multimedia watermarking, interpreted as the total\nweight loss (TWL) in DNN backdoor watermarking, is also unsuitable to measure\nthe fidelity. To solve this problem, we propose the concept of deep fidelity,\nwhich states that the backdoor watermarked DNN model should preserve both the\nfeature representation and decision boundary of the unwatermarked host model.\nAccordingly, to realize deep fidelity, we propose two loss functions termed as\npenultimate feature loss (PFL) and softmax probability-distribution loss (SPL)\nto preserve feature representation, while the decision boundary is preserved by\nthe proposed fix last layer (FixLL) treatment, inspired by the recent discovery\nthat deep learning with a fixed classifier causes no loss of learning accuracy.\nWith the above designs, both embedding from scratch and fine-tuning strategies\nare implemented to evaluate deep fidelity of backdoor embedding, whose\nadvantages over the existing methods are verified via experiments using\nResNet18 for MNIST and CIFAR-10 classifications, and wide residual network\n(i.e., WRN28_10) for CIFAR-100 task.",

    "abstract": "Top-down methods dominate the field of 3D human pose and shape estimation,\nbecause they are decoupled from human detection and allow researchers to focus\non the core problem. However, cropping, their first step, discards the location\ninformation from the very beginning, which makes themselves unable to\naccurately predict the global rotation in the original camera coordinate\nsystem. To address this problem, we propose to Carry Location Information in\nFull Frames (CLIFF) into this task. Specifically, we feed more holistic\nfeatures to CLIFF by concatenating the cropped-image feature with its bounding\nbox information.

Leveraging techniques include sparse and\nlinear attention and hashing tricks; efficient transformers have been proposed\nto reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers but significantly degrade\nthe accuracy. In response, we first interpret the linear attention and residual\nconnections in computing the attention map as gradient descent steps. We then\nintroduce momentum into these components and propose the \\emph{momentum\ntransformer}, which utilizes momentum to improve the accuracy of linear\ntransformers while maintaining linear memory and computational complexities.\nFurthermore, we develop an adaptive strategy to compute the momentum value for\nour model based on the optimal momentum for quadratic optimization. This\nadaptive momentum eliminates the need to search for the optimal momentum value\nand further enhances the performance of the momentum transformer.

Recently, dynamic graph-based methods have been studied and achieved\nSOTA for recommendation, majority of which focus on user's stable long-term\npreference. However, in real-world scenario, user's short-term preference\nevolves over time dynamically. Although there exists sequential methods that\nattempt to capture it, how to model the evolution of short-term preference with\ndynamic graph-based methods has not been well-addressed yet. In particular: 1)\nexisting methods do not explicitly encode and capture the evolution of\nshort-term preference as sequential methods do; 2) simply using last few\ninteractions is not enough for modeling the changing trend. In this paper, we\npropose Long Short-Term Preference Modeling for Continuous-Time Sequential\nRecommendation (LSTSR) to capture the evolution of short-term preference under\ndynamic graph. Specifically, we explicitly encode short-term preference and\noptimize it via memory mechanism, which has three key operations: Message,\nAggregate and Update.

Although\ncomputing optimal seed set is NP-Hard, efficient approximation algorithms\nexist.

In this work, we study the memory\nfootprint of the sampling process collecting reverse reachability information\nin the IMM (Influence Maximization via Martingales) algorithm over large\nreal-world social networks.

    "abstract": "The challenge of fine-grained visual recognition often lies in discovering\nthe key discriminative regions. While such regions can be automatically\nidentified from a large-scale labeled dataset, a similar method might become\nless effective when only a few annotations are available. In low data regimes,\na network often struggles to choose the correct regions for recognition and\ntends to overfit spurious correlated patterns from the training data. To tackle\nthis issue, this paper proposes the self-boosting attention mechanism, a novel\nmethod for regularizing the network to focus on the key regions shared across\nsamples and classes. Specifically, the proposed method first generates an\nattention map for each training image, highlighting the discriminative part for\nidentifying the ground-truth object category. Then the generated attention maps\nare used as pseudo-annotations. The network is enforced to fit them as an\nauxiliary task. We call this approach the self-boosting attention mechanism\n(SAM). We also develop a variant by using SAM to create multiple attention maps\nto pool convolutional maps in a style of bilinear pooling, dubbed SAM-Bilinear.\nThrough extensive experimental studies, we show that both methods can\nsignificantly improve fine-grained visual recognition performance on low data\nregimes and can be incorporated into existing network architectures.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\ncan not only extract visual elements such as colors and shapes but also\nsemantic features.

The imaging of dermoscopy has no main direction, indicating\nthat there are a large number of skin lesion target rotations in the datasets.\nHowever, CNNs lack anti-rotation ability, which is bound to affect the feature\nextraction ability of CNNs. We propose a rotation meanout (RM) network to\nextract rotation invariance features from dermoscopy images. In RM, each set of\nrotated feature maps corresponds to a set of weight-sharing convolution outputs\nand they are fused using meanout operation to obtain the final feature maps.\nThrough theoretical derivation, the proposed RM network is rotation-equivariant\nand can extract rotation-invariant features when being followed by the global\naverage pooling (GAP) operation. The extracted rotation-invariant features can\nbetter represent the original data in classification and retrieval tasks for\ndermoscopy images.

The literature contains a rich body of studies on identifying\ninfluential source spreaders who can spread their own messages to many other\nnodes. In contrast, the identification of influential brokers who can spread\nother nodes' messages to many nodes has not been fully explored. Theoretical\nand empirical studies suggest that involvement of both influential source\nspreaders and brokers is a key to facilitating large-scale information\ndiffusion cascades. Therefore, this paper explores ways to identify influential\nbrokers from a given social network. By using three social media datasets, we\ninvestigate the characteristics of influential brokers by comparing them with\ninfluential source spreaders and central nodes obtained from centrality\nmeasures. Our results show that (i) most of the influential source spreaders\nare not influential brokers (and vice versa) and (ii) the overlap between\ncentral nodes and influential brokers is small (less than 15%) in Twitter\ndatasets. We also tackle the problem of identifying influential brokers from\ncentrality measures and node embeddings, and we examine the effectiveness of\nsocial network features in the broker identification task. Our results show\nthat (iii) although a single centrality measure cannot characterize influential\nbrokers well, prediction models using node embedding features achieve F$_1$\nscores of 0.35--0.68, suggesting the effectiveness of social network features\nfor identifying influential brokers.",

    "abstract": "To tackle the challenge of vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) in complex\nlighting environments and diverse scenes, multi-spectral sources like visible\nand infrared information are taken into consideration due to their excellent\ncomplementary advantages.\nHowever, multi-spectral vehicle Re-ID suffers cross-modality discrepancy\ncaused by heterogeneous properties of different modalities as well as a big\nchallenge of the diverse appearance with different views in each identity.\nMeanwhile, diverse environmental interference leads to heavy sample\ndistributional discrepancy in each modality.\nIn this work, we propose a novel cross-directional consistency network to\nsimultaneously overcome the discrepancies from both modality and sample\naspects.\nIn particular, we design a new cross-directional center loss to pull the\nmodality centers of each identity close to mitigate cross-modality discrepancy,\nwhile the sample centers of each identity close to alleviate the sample\ndiscrepancy. Such strategy can generate discriminative multi-spectral feature\nrepresentations for vehicle Re-ID.\nIn addition, we design an adaptive layer normalization unit to dynamically\nadjust individual feature distribution to handle distributional discrepancy of\nintra-modality features for robust learning.\nTo provide a comprehensive evaluation platform, we create a high-quality\nRGB-NIR-TIR multi-spectral vehicle Re-ID benchmark (MSVR310), including 310\ndifferent vehicles from a broad range of viewpoints, time spans and\nenvironmental complexities.\nComprehensive experiments on both created and public datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach comparing to the state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Although pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance on various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they are shown\nto be lacking in knowledge when dealing with knowledge driven tasks. Despite\nthe many efforts made for injecting knowledge into PLMs, this problem remains\nopen. To address the challenge, we propose \\textbf{DictBERT}, a novel approach\nthat enhances PLMs with dictionary knowledge which is easier to acquire than\nknowledge graph (KG). During pre-training, we present two novel pre-training\ntasks to inject dictionary knowledge into PLMs via contrastive learning:\n\\textit{dictionary entry prediction} and \\textit{entry description\ndiscrimination}. In fine-tuning, we use the pre-trained DictBERT as a plugin\nknowledge base (KB) to retrieve implicit knowledge for identified entries in an\ninput sequence, and infuse the retrieved knowledge into the input to enhance\nits representation via a novel extra-hop attention mechanism. We evaluate our\napproach on a variety of knowledge driven and language understanding tasks,\nincluding NER, relation extraction, CommonsenseQA, OpenBookQA and GLUE.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our model can significantly improve\ntypical PLMs: it gains a substantial improvement of 0.5\\%, 2.9\\%, 9.0\\%, 7.1\\%\nand 3.3\\% on BERT-large respectively, and is also effective on RoBERTa-large.",

    "abstract": "Real-world text applications often involve composing a wide range of text\ncontrol operations, such as editing the text w.r.t. an attribute, manipulating\nkeywords and structure, and generating new text of desired properties. Prior\nwork typically learns/finetunes a language model (LM) to perform individual or\nspecific subsets of operations. Recent research has studied combining\noperations in a plug-and-play manner, often with costly search or optimization\nin the complex sequence space. This paper proposes a new efficient approach for\ncomposable text operations in the compact latent space of text. The\nlow-dimensionality and differentiability of the text latent vector allow us to\ndevelop an efficient sampler based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\ngiven arbitrary plug-in operators (e.g., attribute classifiers). By connecting\npretrained LMs (e.g., GPT2) to the latent space through efficient adaption, we\nthen decode the sampled vectors into desired text sequences. The flexible\napproach permits diverse control operators (sentiment, tense, formality,\nkeywords, etc.) acquired using any relevant data from different domains.\nExperiments show that composing those operators within our approach manages to\ngenerate or edit high-quality text, substantially improving over previous\nmethods in terms of generation quality and efficiency.",

In particular, we\nconsider rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) to enhance spectral efficiency\nby offering opportunities to boost achievable degrees of freedom. Optimizing\nRSMA precoders, however, is highly challenging due to the minimum rate\nconstraint when determining the rate of the common stream. The quantization\nerrors coupled with the precoders further make the problem more complicated and\ndifficult to solve. In this paper, we develop a novel RSMA precoding algorithm\nincorporating quantization errors for maximizing the sum spectral efficiency.\nTo this end, we first obtain an approximate spectral efficiency in a smooth\nfunction. Subsequently, we derive the first-order optimality condition in the\nform of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem (NEP). We propose a computationally\nefficient algorithm to find the principal eigenvector of the NEP as a\nsub-optimal solution. Simulation results validate the superior spectral\nefficiency of the proposed method. The key benefit of using RSMA over spatial\ndivision multiple access (SDMA) comes from the ability of the common stream to\nbalance between the channel gain and quantization error in multiuser MIMO\nsystems with different quantization resolutions.",

    "abstract": "Removing bias while keeping all task-relevant information is challenging for\nfair representation learning methods since they would yield random or\ndegenerate representations w.r.t. labels when the sensitive attributes\ncorrelate with labels. Existing works proposed to inject the label information\ninto the learning procedure to overcome such issues. However, the assumption\nthat the observed labels are clean is not always met. In fact, label bias is\nacknowledged as the primary source inducing discrimination. In other words, the\nfair pre-processing methods ignore the discrimination encoded in the labels\neither during the learning procedure or the evaluation stage. This\ncontradiction puts a question mark on the fairness of the learned\nrepresentations. To circumvent this issue, we explore the following question:\n\\emph{Can we learn fair representations predictable to latent ideal fair labels\ngiven only access to unreliable labels?} In this work, we propose a\n\\textbf{D}e-\\textbf{B}iased \\textbf{R}epresentation Learning for\n\\textbf{F}airness (DBRF) framework which disentangles the sensitive information\nfrom non-sensitive attributes whilst keeping the learned representations\npredictable to ideal fair labels rather than observed biased ones. We formulate\nthe de-biased learning framework through information-theoretic concepts such as\nmutual information and information bottleneck. The core concept is that DBRF\nadvocates not to use unreliable labels for supervision when sensitive\ninformation benefits the prediction of unreliable labels.

Moreover, they can be used for building damage\nassessment after natural disasters. Currently, most of the existing models for\nbuilding detection use only one image (pre-disaster image) to detect buildings.\nThis is based on the idea that post-disaster images reduce the model's\nperformance because of presence of destroyed buildings. In this paper, we\npropose a siamese model, called SiamixFormer, which uses pre- and post-disaster\nimages as input. Our model has two encoders and has a hierarchical transformer\narchitecture. The output of each stage in both encoders is given to a temporal\ntransformer for feature fusion in a way that query is generated from\npre-disaster images and (key, value) is generated from post-disaster images. To\nthis end, temporal features are also considered in feature fusion. Another\nadvantage of using temporal transformers in feature fusion is that they can\nbetter maintain large receptive fields generated by transformer encoders\ncompared with CNNs. Finally, the output of the temporal transformer is given to\na simple MLP decoder at each stage. The SiamixFormer model is evaluated on xBD,\nand WHU datasets, for building detection and on LEVIR-CD and CDD datasets for\nchange detection and could outperform the state-of-the-art.",

Considering 1) the massive amount of\nexperience required to train such methods, and 2) that experience must be\ngathered by interacting in an exploratory fashion with real road-network-users,\nsuch a lack of transferability limits experimentation and applicability. Recent\napproaches enable learning policies that generalize for unseen road-network\ntopologies and traffic distributions, partially tackling this challenge.\nHowever, the literature remains divided between the learning of cyclic (the\nevolution of connectivity at an intersection must respect a cycle) and acyclic\n(less constrained) policies, and these transferable methods 1) are only\ncompatible with cyclic constraints and 2) do not enable coordination. We\nintroduce a new model-based method, MuJAM, which, on top of enabling explicit\ncoordination at scale for the first time, pushes generalization further by\nallowing a generalization to the controllers' constraints. In a zero-shot\ntransfer setting involving both road networks and traffic settings never\nexperienced during training, and in a larger transfer experiment involving the\ncontrol of 3,971 traffic signal controllers in Manhattan, we show that MuJAM,\nusing both cyclic and acyclic constraints, outperforms domain-specific\nbaselines as well as another transferable approach.",

Test script fragility is a multi-faceted problem, but\none crucial challenge is reliably identifying and locating the correct target\nweb elements when the website evolves between releases or otherwise fails and\nreports an issue. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel approach called\nsimilarity-based web element localization (Similo), which leverages information\nfrom multiple web element locator parameters to identify a target element using\na weighted similarity score. The experimental study compares Similo to a\nbaseline approach for web element localization. To get an extensive empirical\nbasis, we target 40 of the most popular websites on the Internet in our\nevaluation. Robustness is considered by counting the number of web elements\nfound in a recent website version compared to how many of these existed in an\nolder version. Results of the experiment show that Similo outperforms the\nbaseline representing the current state-of-the-art; it failed to locate the\ncorrect target web element in 72 out of 598 considered cases compared to 146\nfailed cases for the baseline approach. This study presents evidence that\nquantifying the similarity between multiple attributes of web elements when\ntrying to locate them, as in our proposed Similo approach, is beneficial. With\nacceptable efficiency, Similo gives significantly higher effectiveness (i.e.,\nrobustness) than the baseline web element localization approach.",

The lack of exposition on trust\nitself suggests that trust is commonly understood, uncomplicated, or even\nuninteresting. But is it? Our analysis of TAI publications reveals numerous\norientations which differ in terms of who is doing the trusting (agent), in\nwhat (object), on the basis of what (basis), in order to what (objective), and\nwhy (impact). We develop an ontology that encapsulates these key axes of\ndifference to a) illuminate seeming inconsistencies across the literature and\nb) more effectively manage a dizzying number of TAI considerations. We then\nreflect this ontology through a corpus of publications exploring fairness,\naccountability, and transparency to examine the variety of ways that TAI is\nconsidered within and between these approaches to promoting trust.",

To this end, in the present work we propose a novel\nstochastic Galerkin (sG) particle methods for collisional kinetic models of\nplasmas under the effect of uncertainties. This class of methods is based on a\ngeneralized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion of the particles' position and\nvelocity. In details, we introduce a stochastic particle approximation for the\nVlasov-Poisson system with a BGK term describing plasma collisions. A careful\nreformulation of such dynamics is needed to perform the sG projection and to\nobtain the corresponding system for the gPC coefficients. We show that the sG\nparticle method preserves the main physical properties of the problem, such as\nconservations and positivity of the solution, while achieving spectral accuracy\nfor smooth solutions in the random space. Furthermore, in the fluid limit the\nsG particle solver is designed to possess the asymptotic-preserving property\nnecessary to obtain a sG particle scheme for the limiting Euler-Poisson system,\nthus avoiding the loss of hyperbolicity typical of conventional sG methods\nbased on finite differences or finite volumes. We tested the schemes\nconsidering the classical Landau damping problem in the presence of both small\nand large initial uncertain perturbations, the two stream instability and the\nSod shock tube problems under uncertainties.

To that end, volumetric mesh is filtered by the solution of\npseudo-solid governing equations which are stiffened by the mesh-Jacobian and\nendowed with the Robin boundary condition which involves the Laplace-Beltrami\noperator on the mesh boundaries. Its superior performance from the\nnon-simultaneous (sequential) treatment of boundary and internal meshes is\ndemonstrated for the shape optimization of a complex solid structure.\nWell-established explicit filters, namely Gaussian and linear, and the\nHelmholtz/Sobolev-based (implicit) filter are critically examined in terms of\nconsistency (rigid-body-movement production), geometric characteristics and the\ncomputational cost. It is shown that the implicit filtering is numerically more\nefficient and unconditionally consistent, compared to the explicit one.\nSupported by numerical experiments, a regularized Green's function is\nintroduced as an equivalent explicit form of the Helmholtz/Sobolev filter.\nFurthermore, we give special attention to derive mesh-independent filtered\nsensitivities for node-based shape optimization with non-uniform meshes.

Although one-time tags do not seem to have\nenough information to persistently track users, we demonstrate that this tag,\ndespite its ephemeral nature, when combined with Facebook Pixel, can aid in\npersistent tracking of users across space (i.e., different websites) and time\n(i.e., both in the past as well as in the future).

To avoid using equivariant representations, we introduce a\nnovel local frame method to molecule representation learning and analyze its\nexpressive power. With a frame and the projection of equivariant vectors on the\nframe, GNNs can map the local environment of an atom to a scalar representation\ninjectively.

For\nsymmetric molecules, though only degenerate frames can be built, we find that\nthe local frame method may still achieve high expressive power in some common\ncases due to the reduced degrees of freedom.

    "abstract": "Safe Policy Improvement (SPI) is an important technique for offline\nreinforcement learning in safety critical applications as it improves the\nbehavior policy with a high probability. We classify various SPI approaches\nfrom the literature into two groups, based on how they utilize the uncertainty\nof state-action pairs. Focusing on the Soft-SPIBB (Safe Policy Improvement with\nSoft Baseline Bootstrapping) algorithms, we show that their claim of being\nprovably safe does not hold. Based on this finding, we develop adaptations, the\nAdv-Soft-SPIBB algorithms, and show that they are provably safe. A heuristic\nadaptation, Lower-Approx-Soft-SPIBB, yields the best performance among all\nSPIBB algorithms in extensive experiments on two benchmarks. We also check the\nsafety guarantees of the provably safe algorithms and show that huge amounts of\ndata are necessary such that the safety bounds become useful in practice.",

A number of technologies (such as LBIC, EBIC and LPS) have been\ndeveloped which allow the detection of doping variations via photovoltaic\neffects. The idea is to illuminate the sample at several positions, and detect\nthe resulting voltage drop or current at the contacts. We model a general class\nof such photovoltaic technologies by ill-posed global and local inverse\nproblems based on a drift-diffusion system which describes charge transport in\na self-consistent electrical field. The doping profile is included as a\nparametric field. To numerically solve a physically relevant local inverse\nproblem, we present three different data-driven approaches, based on least\nsquares, multilayer perceptrons, and residual neural networks. Our data-driven\nmethods reconstruct the doping profile for a given spatially varying voltage\nsignal induced by a laser scan along the sample's surface. The methods are\ntrained on synthetic data sets (pairs of discrete doping profiles and\ncorresponding photovoltage signals at different illumination positions) which\nare generated by efficient physics-preserving finite volume solutions of the\nforward problem. While the linear least square method yields an average\nabsolute error around 10%, the nonlinear networks roughly halve this error to\n5%, respectively.

You may imagine its\noriginal shape from previously captured images, recover its overall (global)\nbut coarse shape first, and then refine its local details. We are motivated to\nimitate the physical repair procedure to address point cloud completion. To\nthis end, we propose a cross-modal shape-transfer dual-refinement network\n(termed CSDN), a coarse-to-fine paradigm with images of full-cycle\nparticipation, for quality point cloud completion. CSDN mainly consists of\n\"shape fusion\" and \"dual-refinement\" modules to tackle the cross-modal\nchallenge. The first module transfers the intrinsic shape characteristics from\nsingle images to guide the geometry generation of the missing regions of point\nclouds, in which we propose IPAdaIN to embed the global features of both the\nimage and the partial point cloud into completion. The second module refines\nthe coarse output by adjusting the positions of the generated points, where the\nlocal refinement unit exploits the geometric relation between the novel and the\ninput points by graph convolution, and the global constraint unit utilizes the\ninput image to fine-tune the generated offset. Different from most existing\napproaches, CSDN not only explores the complementary information from images\nbut also effectively exploits cross-modal data in the whole coarse-to-fine\ncompletion procedure.

    "abstract": "Compared to on-policy policy gradient techniques, off-policy model-free deep\nreinforcement learning (RL) approaches that use previously gathered data can\nimprove sampling efficiency. However, off-policy learning becomes challenging\nwhen the discrepancy between the distributions of the policy of interest and\nthe policies that collected the data increases. Although the well-studied\nimportance sampling and off-policy policy gradient techniques were proposed to\ncompensate for this discrepancy, they usually require a collection of long\ntrajectories that increases the computational complexity and induce additional\nproblems such as vanishing or exploding gradients. Moreover, their\ngeneralization to continuous action domains is strictly limited as they require\naction probabilities, which is unsuitable for deterministic policies. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce an alternative off-policy correction\nalgorithm for continuous action spaces, Actor-Critic Off-Policy Correction\n(AC-Off-POC), to mitigate the potential drawbacks introduced by the previously\ncollected data. Through a novel discrepancy measure computed by the agent's\nmost recent action decisions on the states of the randomly sampled batch of\ntransitions, the approach does not require actual or estimated action\nprobabilities for any policy and offers an adequate one-step importance\nsampling. Theoretical results show that the introduced approach can achieve a\ncontraction mapping with a fixed unique point, which allows a \"safe\" off-policy\nlearning. Our empirical results suggest that AC-Off-POC consistently improves\nthe state-of-the-art and attains higher returns in fewer steps than the\ncompeting methods by efficiently scheduling the learning rate in Q-learning and\npolicy optimization.",

While prior work in sensor network based\nnavigation uses explicit mapping and planning techniques, and are often aided\nby external positioning systems, we propose a vision-only based learning\napproach that leverages a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode and communicate\nrelevant viewpoint information to the mobile robot. During navigation, the\nrobot is guided by a model that we train through imitation learning to\napproximate optimal motion primitives, thereby predicting the effective\ncost-to-go (to the target). In our experiments, we first demonstrate\ngeneralizability to previously unseen environments with various sensor layouts.\nSimulation results show that by utilizing communication among the sensors and\nrobot, we can achieve a $18.1\\%$ improvement in success rate while decreasing\npath detour mean by $29.3\\%$ and variability by $48.4\\%$.

    "title": "HiKonv: Maximizing the Throughput of Quantized Convolution With Novel  Bit-wise Management and Computation",
    "abstract": "Quantization for CNN has shown significant progress with the intention of\nreducing the cost of computation and storage with low-bitwidth data\nrepresentations. There are, however, no systematic studies on how an existing\nfull-bitwidth processing unit, such as ALU in CPUs and DSP in FPGAs, can be\nbetter utilized to deliver significantly higher computation throughput for\nconvolution under various quantized bitwidths. In this study, we propose\nHiKonv, a unified solution that maximizes the throughput of convolution on a\ngiven underlying processing unit with low-bitwidth quantized data inputs\nthrough novel bit-wise management and parallel computation. We establish\ntheoretical framework and performance models using a full-bitwidth multiplier\nfor highly parallelized low-bitwidth convolution, and demonstrate new\nbreakthroughs for high-performance computing in this critical domain. For\nexample, a single 32-bit processing unit in CPU can deliver 128 binarized\nconvolution operations (multiplications and additions) and 13 4-bit convolution\noperations with a single multiplication instruction, and a single 27x18\nmultiplier in the FPGA DSP can deliver 60, 8 or 2 convolution operations with\n1, 4 or 8-bit inputs in one clock cycle. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nHiKonv on both CPU and FPGA. On CPU, HiKonv outperforms the baseline\nimplementation with 1 to 8-bit inputs and provides up to 7.6x and 1.4x\nperformance improvements for 1-D convolution, and performs 2.74x and 3.19x over\nthe baseline implementation for 4-bit signed and unsigned data inputs for 2-D\nconvolution. On FPGA, HiKonv solution enables a single DSP to process multiple\nconvolutions with a shorter processing latency. For binarized input, each DSP\nwith HiKonv is equivalent up to 76.6 LUTs. Compared to the DAC-SDC 2020\nchampion model, HiKonv achieves a 2.37x throughput improvement and 2.61x DSP\nefficiency improvement, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Recently, numbers of works shows that the performance of neural machine\ntranslation (NMT) can be improved to a certain extent with using visual\ninformation. However, most of these conclusions are drawn from the analysis of\nexperimental results based on a limited set of bilingual sentence-image pairs,\nsuch as Multi30K. In these kinds of datasets, the content of one bilingual\nparallel sentence pair must be well represented by a manually annotated image,\nwhich is different with the actual translation situation. Some previous works\nare proposed to addressed the problem by retrieving images from exiting\nsentence-image pairs with topic model. However, because of the limited\ncollection of sentence-image pairs they used, their image retrieval method is\ndifficult to deal with the out-of-vocabulary words, and can hardly prove that\nvisual information enhance NMT rather than the co-occurrence of images and\nsentences. In this paper, we propose an open-vocabulary image retrieval methods\nto collect descriptive images for bilingual parallel corpus using image search\nengine. Next, we propose text-aware attentive visual encoder to filter\nincorrectly collected noise images.

    "abstract": "Synthesizing multi-character interactions is a challenging task due to the\ncomplex and varied interactions between the characters. In particular, precise\nspatiotemporal alignment between characters is required in generating close\ninteractions such as dancing and fighting. Existing work in generating\nmulti-character interactions focuses on generating a single type of reactive\nmotion for a given sequence which results in a lack of variety of the resultant\nmotions. In this paper, we propose a novel way to create realistic human\nreactive motions which are not presented in the given dataset by mixing and\nmatching different types of close interactions. We propose a Conditional\nHierarchical Generative Adversarial Network with Multi-Hot Class Embedding to\ngenerate the Mix and Match reactive motions of the follower from a given motion\nsequence of the leader. Experiments are conducted on both noisy (depth-based)\nand high-quality (MoCap-based) interaction datasets. The quantitative and\nqualitative results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods on the given datasets.

    "abstract": "Class incremental learning (CIL) involves learning a classification model\nwhere groups of new classes are encountered in every learning phase. The goal\nis to learn a unified model performant on all the classes observed so far.\nGiven the recent popularity of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in conventional\nclassification settings, an interesting question is to study their continual\nlearning behaviour. In this work, we develop a Debiased Dual Distilled\nTransformer for CIL dubbed $\\textrm{D}^3\\textrm{Former}$. The proposed model\nleverages a hybrid nested ViT design to ensure data efficiency and scalability\nto small as well as large datasets. In contrast to a recent ViT based CIL\napproach, our $\\textrm{D}^3\\textrm{Former}$ does not dynamically expand its\narchitecture when new tasks are learned and remains suitable for a large number\nof incremental tasks. The improved CIL behaviour of\n$\\textrm{D}^3\\textrm{Former}$ owes to two fundamental changes to the ViT\ndesign. First, we treat the incremental learning as a long-tail classification\nproblem where the majority samples from new classes vastly outnumber the\nlimited exemplars available for old classes. To avoid biasness against the\nminority old classes, we propose to dynamically adjust logits to emphasize on\nretaining the representations relevant to old tasks. Second, we propose to\npreserve the configuration of spatial attention maps as the learning progresses\nacross tasks. This helps in reducing catastrophic forgetting via constraining\nthe model to retain the attention on the most discriminative regions.\n$\\textrm{D}^3\\textrm{Former}$ obtains favorable results on incremental versions\nof CIFAR-100, MNIST, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks for image-based screening and computer-aided diagnosis\nhave achieved expert-level performance on various medical imaging modalities,\nincluding chest radiographs. Recently, several works have indicated that these\nstate-of-the-art classifiers can be biased with respect to sensitive patient\nattributes, such as race or gender, leading to growing concerns about\ndemographic disparities and discrimination resulting from algorithmic and\nmodel-based decision-making in healthcare. Fair machine learning has focused on\nmitigating such biases against disadvantaged or marginalised groups, mainly\nconcentrating on tabular data or natural images. This work presents two novel\nintra-processing techniques based on fine-tuning and pruning an already-trained\nneural network. These methods are simple yet effective and can be readily\napplied post hoc in a setting where the protected attribute is unknown during\nthe model development and test time. In addition, we compare several intra- and\npost-processing approaches applied to debiasing deep chest X-ray classifiers.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first efforts studying\ndebiasing methods on chest radiographs.

    "abstract": "It is known that representations from self-supervised pre-training can\nperform on par, and often better, on various downstream tasks than\nrepresentations from fully-supervised pre-training. This has been shown in a\nhost of settings such as generic object classification and detection, semantic\nsegmentation, and image retrieval. However, some issues have recently come to\nthe fore that demonstrate some of the failure modes of self-supervised\nrepresentations, such as performance on non-ImageNet-like data, or complex\nscenes. In this paper, we show that self-supervised representations based on\nthe instance discrimination objective lead to better representations of objects\nthat are more robust to changes in the viewpoint and perspective of the object.\nWe perform experiments of modern self-supervised methods against multiple\nsupervised baselines to demonstrate this, including approximating object\nviewpoint variation through homographies, and real-world tests based on several\nmulti-view datasets. We find that self-supervised representations are more\nrobust to object viewpoint and appear to encode more pertinent information\nabout objects that facilitate the recognition of objects from novel views.",

Deep generative algorithms,\nsuch as, Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) are widely used to accomplish\nsuch tasks.

In most cases,\nConvolutional Neural Network(CNN) based discriminators are being used for\ndetecting such synthesized media.

In this paper, we\nleveraged an optical flow based feature extraction approach to extract the\ntemporal features, which are then fed to a hybrid model for classification.\nThis hybrid model is based on the combination of CNN and recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN) architectures. The hybrid model provides effective performance on\nopen source data-sets such as, DFDC, FF++ and Celeb-DF. This proposed method\nshows an accuracy of 66.26%, 91.21% and 79.49% in DFDC, FF++, and Celeb-DF\nrespectively with a very reduced No of sample size of approx 100\nsamples(frames).

    "abstract": "Differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS), as a gradient-guided\nsearch method, greatly reduces the cost of computation and speeds up the\nsearch. In DARTS, the architecture parameters are introduced to the candidate\noperations, but the parameters of some weight-equipped operations may not be\ntrained well in the initial stage, which causes unfair competition between\ncandidate operations. The weight-free operations appear in large numbers which\nresults in the phenomenon of performance crash. Besides, a lot of memory will\nbe occupied during training supernet which causes the memory utilization to be\nlow. In this paper, a partial channel connection based on channel attention for\ndifferentiable neural architecture search (ADARTS) is proposed. Some channels\nwith higher weights are selected through the attention mechanism and sent into\nthe operation space while the other channels are directly contacted with the\nprocessed channels. Selecting a few channels with higher attention weights can\nbetter transmit important feature information into the search space and greatly\nimprove search efficiency and memory utilization. The instability of network\nstructure caused by random selection can also be avoided. The experimental\nresults show that ADARTS achieved 2.46% and 17.06% classification error rates\non CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

However, as the deep learning algorithms evolve frequently, the\nengineering effort and cost of designing the hardware accelerators are greatly\nincreased.

    "abstract": "Anchor-free detectors basically formulate object detection as dense\nclassification and regression. For popular anchor-free detectors, it is common\nto introduce an individual prediction branch to estimate the quality of\nlocalization. The following inconsistencies are observed when we delve into the\npractices of classification and quality estimation. Firstly, for some adjacent\nsamples which are assigned completely different labels, the trained model would\nproduce similar classification scores. This violates the training objective and\nleads to performance degradation. Secondly, it is found that detected bounding\nboxes with higher confidences contrarily have smaller overlaps with the\ncorresponding ground-truth. Accurately localized bounding boxes would be\nsuppressed by less accurate ones in the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)\nprocedure. To address the inconsistency problems, the Dynamic Smooth Label\nAssignment (DSLA) method is proposed. Based on the concept of centerness\noriginally developed in FCOS, a smooth assignment strategy is proposed. The\nlabel is smoothed to a continuous value in [0, 1] to make a steady transition\nbetween positive and negative samples. Intersection-of-Union (IoU) is predicted\ndynamically during training and is coupled with the smoothed label. The dynamic\nsmooth label is assigned to supervise the classification branch. Under such\nsupervision, quality estimation branch is naturally merged into the\nclassification branch, which simplifies the architecture of anchor-free\ndetector. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the MS COCO benchmark. It\nis demonstrated that, DSLA can significantly boost the detection accuracy by\nalleviating the above inconsistencies for anchor-free detectors.

However, to obtain license of fully automated\nvehicles for widespread public use, it is necessary to assure safety of the\nentire system, which is still a challenge. This holds in particular for\nAI-based perception systems that have to handle a diversity of environmental\nconditions and road users, and at the same time should robustly detect all\nsafety relevant objects (i.e no detection misses should occur). Yet, limited\ntraining and validation data make a proof of fault-free operation hardly\nachievable, as the perception system might be exposed to new, yet unknown\nobjects or conditions on public roads. Hence, new safety approaches for\nAI-based perception systems are required. For this reason we propose in this\npaper a novel hierarchical monitoring approach that is able to validate the\nobject list from a primary perception system, can reliably detect detection\nmisses, and at the same time has a very low false alarm rate.",

    "title": "How Do Requirements Evolve During Elicitation? An Empirical Study  Combining Interviews and App Store Analysis",
    "abstract": "Requirements are elicited from the customer and other stakeholders through an\niterative process of interviews, prototyping, and other interactive sessions.\nThen, requirements can be further extended, based on the analysis of the\nfeatures of competing products available on the market. Understanding how this\nprocess takes place can help to identify the contribution of the different\nelicitation phases, thereby allowing requirements analysts to better distribute\ntheir resources. In this work, we empirically study in which way requirements\nget transformed from initial ideas into documented needs, and then evolve based\non the inspiration coming from similar products. To this end, we select 30\nsubjects that act as requirements analysts, and we perform interview-based\nelicitation sessions with a fictional customer. After the sessions, the\nanalysts produce a first set of requirements for the system. Then, they are\nrequired to search similar products in the app stores, and extend the\nrequirements, inspired by the identified apps. The requirements documented at\neach step are evaluated, to assess to which extent and in which way the initial\nidea evolved throughout the process. Our results show that only between 30\\%\nand 38\\% of the requirements produced after the interviews include content that\ncan be fully traced to initial customer's ideas. Furthermore, up to 42\\% of the\nrequirements inspired by the app stores cover additional features compared to\nthe ones identified after the interviews. The results empirically show that\nrequirements are not elicited in strict sense, but actually co-created through\ninterviews, with analysts playing a crucial role in the process. In addition,\nwe show evidence that app store-inspired elicitation can be particularly\nbeneficial to complete the requirements.",

    "abstract": "Learning with sparse rewards is usually inefficient in Reinforcement Learning\n(RL). Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) has been shown an effective solution to\nhandle the low sample efficiency that results from sparse rewards by goal\nrelabeling. However, the HER still has an implicit virtual-positive sparse\nreward problem caused by invariant achieved goals, especially for robot\nmanipulation tasks. To solve this problem, we propose a novel model-free\ncontinual RL algorithm, called Relay-HER (RHER). The proposed method first\ndecomposes and rearranges the original long-horizon task into new sub-tasks\nwith incremental complexity. Subsequently, a multi-task network is designed to\nlearn the sub-tasks in ascending order of complexity. To solve the\nvirtual-positive sparse reward problem, we propose a Random-Mixed Exploration\nStrategy (RMES), in which the achieved goals of the sub-task with higher\ncomplexity are quickly changed under the guidance of the one with lower\ncomplexity. The experimental results indicate the significant improvements in\nsample efficiency of RHER compared to vanilla-HER in five typical robot\nmanipulation tasks, including Push, PickAndPlace, Drawer, Insert, and\nObstaclePush. The proposed RHER method has also been applied to learn a\ncontact-rich push task on a physical robot from scratch, and the success rate\nreached 10/10 with only 250 episodes.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic facial expression recognition (FER) databases provide important data\nsupport for affective computing and applications. However, most FER databases\nare annotated with several basic mutually exclusive emotional categories and\ncontain only one modality, e.g., videos. The monotonous labels and modality\ncannot accurately imitate human emotions and fulfill applications in the real\nworld. In this paper, we propose MAFW, a large-scale multi-modal compound\naffective database with 10,045 video-audio clips in the wild. Each clip is\nannotated with a compound emotional category and a couple of sentences that\ndescribe the subjects' affective behaviors in the clip. For the compound\nemotion annotation, each clip is categorized into one or more of the 11\nwidely-used emotions, i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness,\nsurprise, contempt, anxiety, helplessness, and disappointment. To ensure high\nquality of the labels, we filter out the unreliable annotations by an\nExpectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and then obtain 11 single-label\nemotion categories and 32 multi-label emotion categories. To the best of our\nknowledge, MAFW is the first in-the-wild multi-modal database annotated with\ncompound emotion annotations and emotion-related captions. Additionally, we\nalso propose a novel Transformer-based expression snippet feature learning\nmethod to recognize the compound emotions leveraging the expression-change\nrelations among different emotions and modalities. Extensive experiments on\nMAFW database show the advantages of the proposed method over other\nstate-of-the-art methods for both uni- and multi-modal FER.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging promising paradigm of\nprivacy-preserving machine learning (ML). An important type of FL is cross-silo\nFL, which enables a small scale of organizations to cooperatively train a\nshared model by keeping confidential data locally and aggregating weights on a\ncentral parameter server. However, the central server may be vulnerable to\nmalicious attacks or software failures in practice. To address this issue, in\nthis paper, we propose DeFL, a novel decentralized weight aggregation framework\nfor cross-silo FL. DeFL eliminates the central server by aggregating weights on\neach participating node and weights of only the current training round are\nmaintained and synchronized among all nodes. We use Multi-Krum to enable\naggregating correct weights from honest nodes and use HotStuff to ensure the\nconsistency of the training round number and weights among all nodes. Besides,\nwe theoretically analyze the Byzantine fault tolerance, convergence, and\ncomplexity of DeFL. We conduct extensive experiments over two widely-adopted\npublic datasets, i.e. CIFAR-10 and Sentiment140, to evaluate the performance of\nDeFL. Results show that DeFL defends against common threat models with minimal\naccuracy loss, and achieves up to 100x reduction in storage overhead and up to\n12x reduction in network overhead, compared to state-of-the-art decentralized\nFL approaches.",

To address that, we propose Subgraph Neighboring Relations Infomax,\nSNRI, which sufficiently exploits complete neighboring relations from two\naspects: neighboring relational feature for node feature and neighboring\nrelational path for sparse subgraph. To further model neighboring relations in\na global way, we innovatively apply mutual information (MI) maximization for\nknowledge graph.

In this work, we relax this scenario\nby allowing the dominant path AOA and path-loss (PL) to be time-variant.\nAssuming a highway scenario with line of sight (LOS) propagation between\nvehicles, we use affine approximations to model the time variation of different\npath quantities, including the PL, the relative distance-dependent phase shift\nbetween antennas, and the AOA-dependent far-field function of the antennas.\nUsing these approximations, we analytically derive the ACN sum-SNRs as each one\nof these quantities vary over the duration of $K$ packets. Moreover, we suggest\na phase slope design rule that is robust against time variation of the dominant\npath and optimal under time-invariant conditions. Finally, we validate this\ndesign rule using numerical computations and an example of vehicular\ncommunication antenna elements.",

We introduce a wearable device to acquire real-world environment test\ndata to demonstrate the performance and the robustness of the approach. Mean\nabsolute error (gait phase, stair slope) and accuracy (locomotion mode) were\ndetermined for steady level walking and steady stair ambulation. Robustness was\nassessed using test data from different sensor hardware, sensor fixations,\nambulation environments and subjects. The mean absolute error from the steady\ngait test data for the gait phase was 2.0-3.5 % for gait phase estimation and\n3.3-3.8{\\deg} for stair slope estimation. The accuracy of classifying the\ncorrect locomotion mode on the test data with the utilization of time history\ninformation was in between 98.51 % and 99.67 %.

Notably, our\nproposed model is able to achieve superior results with less than half the\nnetwork parameters and memory access cost when compared with the commonly-used\nPointNet-based approach. We show benefits from using a contact map that rules\nhand-object interactions to produce more accurate reconstructions. We further\ndemonstrate that training with pseudo-labels can extend contact map estimations\nto out-of-domain objects and generalise better across multiple datasets.",

    "abstract": "Currently, due to the high scalability and global coverage of space\ninformation network (SIN), more service providers and users are willing to\nprovide or subscribe to personal services through the satellite network.\nHowever, the messages are transmitted in public satellite-ground links, which\nmakes access users vulnerable to various forms of attacks. Existing\nauthentication protocols do not meet the expected security and short delay\nrequirements to ensure the security of real-time user access and the\nconfidentiality of communication content. Moreover, with the development of\nquantum computers, the difficult problems such as ECDLP and DLP have also been\nproven to be solvable in polynomial time, leading to new threats. Therefore, in\nthis paper, we propose a provably secure and anti-quantum authentication\nprotocol based on randomized RLWE. The protocol not only meets the pre-defined\nsecurity requirements, but also reduces the total delay of the authentication\nphase based on the pre-negotiation and fewer authentication transmission. In\naddition, a concise handover scheme is designed for signal handover scenarios\ncaused by satellite dynamic topology. Further rigorous formal and informal\nsecurity proofs and performance analysis show that our proposed protocol is\nmore applicable to SIN, while ensuring higher security and resisting various\nattacks with lower authentication delay.",

The common perception is that these friends exert influence on\nthe user, effecting his decision whether to re-share content or not. Hinging\nupon this intuition, a variety of models were developed to predict how\ninformation propagates in OSN, similar to the way infection spreads in the\npopulation. In this paper, we revisit this world view and arrive at new\nconclusions. Given a set of users $V$, we study the task of predicting whether\na user $u \\in V$ will re-share content by some $v \\in V$ at the following time\nwindow given the activity of all the users in $V$ in the previous time window.\nWe design several algorithms for this task, ranging from a simple greedy\nalgorithm that only learns $u$'s conditional probability distribution, ignoring\nthe rest of $V$, to a convolutional neural network-based algorithm that\nreceives the activity of all of $V$, but does not receive explicitly the social\nlink structure. We tested our algorithms on four datasets that we collected\nfrom Twitter, each revolving around a different popular topic in 2020. The best\nperformance, average F1-score of 0.86 over the four datasets, was achieved by\nthe convolutional neural network.

    "abstract": "Recent research on the robustness of deep learning has shown that Vision\nTransformers (ViTs) surpass the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) under some\nperturbations, e.g., natural corruption, adversarial attacks, etc. Some papers\nargue that the superior robustness of ViT comes from the segmentation of its\ninput images; others say that the Multi-head Self-Attention (MSA) is the key to\npreserving the robustness. In this paper, we aim to introduce a principled and\nunified theoretical framework to investigate such an argument on ViT's\nrobustness. We first theoretically prove that, unlike Transformers in Natural\nLanguage Processing, ViTs are Lipschitz continuous. Then we theoretically\nanalyze the adversarial robustness of ViTs from the perspective of the Cauchy\nProblem, via which we can quantify how the robustness propagates through\nlayers. We demonstrate that the first and last layers are the critical factors\nto affect the robustness of ViTs. Furthermore, based on our theory, we\nempirically show that unlike the claims from existing research, MSA only\ncontributes to the adversarial robustness of ViTs under weak adversarial\nattacks, e.g., FGSM, and surprisingly, MSA actually comprises the model's\nadversarial robustness under stronger attacks, e.g., PGD attacks.",

In contrast to many methods which use fixed feedback gains, our\ntime-varying controller computes the optimal gains depending on the location in\nthe workspace and the future trajectory. Meanwhile, we rely heavily on offline\ncomputation to reduce the burden of online implementation and feasibility\nchecking. Following the growing popularity of probabilistic graphical models\nfor optimal control, we use factor graphs as a tool to formulate our controller\nfor their efficiency, intuitiveness, and modularity. The topology of a factor\ngraph encodes the relevant structural properties of equations in a way that\nfacilitates insight and efficient computation using sparse linear algebra\nsolvers. We first use factor graph optimization to compute a nominal\ntrajectory, then linearize the graph and apply variable elimination to compute\nthe locally optimal, time varying linear feedback gains. Next, we leverage the\nfactor graph formulation to compute the locally optimal, time-varying Kalman\nFilter gains, and finally combine the locally optimal linear control and\nestimation laws to form a TV-LQG controller. We compare the tracking accuracy\nof our TV-LQG controller to a state-of-the-art dual-space feed-forward\ncontroller on a 2.9m x 2.3m, 4-cable planar robot and demonstrate improved\ntracking accuracies of 0.8{\\deg} and 11.6mm root mean square error in rotation\nand translation respectively.",

    "abstract": "Many cryptocurrency platforms are vulnerable to Maximal Extractable Value\n(MEV) attacks, where a malicious consensus leader can inject transactions or\nchange the order of user transactions to maximize its profit.\nA promising line of research in MEV mitigation is to enhance the Byzantine\nFault Tolerance (BFT) consensus core of blockchains by new functionalities,\nlike hiding transaction contents, such that malicious parties cannot analyze\nand exploit them until they are ordered. An orthogonal line of research\ndemonstrates excellent performance for BFT protocols designed around Directed\nAcyclic Graphs (DAG). They provide high throughput by keeping high network\nutilization, decoupling transactions' dissemination from their metadata\nordering, and encoding consensus logic efficiently over a DAG representing a\ncausal ordering of disseminated messages.\nThis paper explains how to combine these two advances. It introduces a\nDAG-based protocol called Fino, that integrates MEV-resistance features into\nDAG-based BFT without delaying the steady spreading of transactions by the DAG\ntransport and with zero message overhead. The scheme operates without secret\nshare verifiability or recoverability, and in the happy path, works in\nmicroseconds latency avoiding costly threshold encryption.",

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and its variants have exhibited great success on\nrepresenting 3D scenes and synthesizing photo-realistic novel views. However,\nthey are generally based on the pinhole camera model and assume all-in-focus\ninputs. This limits their applicability as images captured from the real world\noften have finite depth-of-field (DoF). To mitigate this issue, we introduce\nDoF-NeRF, a novel neural rendering approach that can deal with shallow DoF\ninputs and can simulate DoF effect. In particular, it extends NeRF to simulate\nthe aperture of lens following the principles of geometric optics. Such a\nphysical guarantee allows DoF-NeRF to operate views with different focus\nconfigurations. Benefiting from explicit aperture modeling, DoF-NeRF also\nenables direct manipulation of DoF effect by adjusting virtual aperture and\nfocus parameters. It is plug-and-play and can be inserted into NeRF-based\nframeworks. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that,\nDoF-NeRF not only performs comparably with NeRF in the all-in-focus setting,\nbut also can synthesize all-in-focus novel views conditioned on shallow DoF\ninputs. An interesting application of DoF-NeRF to DoF rendering is also\ndemonstrated. The source code will be made available at\nhttps://github.com/zijinwuzijin/DoF-NeRF.",

    "abstract": "Previous methods based on 3DCNN, convLSTM, or optical flow have achieved\ngreat success in video salient object detection (VSOD). However, they still\nsuffer from high computational costs or poor quality of the generated saliency\nmaps. To solve these problems, we design a space-time memory (STM)-based\nnetwork, which extracts useful temporal information of the current frame from\nadjacent frames as the temporal branch of VSOD. Furthermore, previous methods\nonly considered single-frame prediction without temporal association. As a\nresult, the model may not focus on the temporal information sufficiently. Thus,\nwe initially introduce object motion prediction between inter-frame into VSOD.\nOur model follows standard encoder--decoder architecture. In the encoding\nstage, we generate high-level temporal features by using high-level features\nfrom the current and its adjacent frames. This approach is more efficient than\nthe optical flow-based methods. In the decoding stage, we propose an effective\nfusion strategy for spatial and temporal branches. The semantic information of\nthe high-level features is used to fuse the object details in the low-level\nfeatures, and then the spatiotemporal features are obtained step by step to\nreconstruct the saliency maps. Moreover, inspired by the boundary supervision\ncommonly used in image salient object detection (ISOD), we design a\nmotion-aware loss for predicting object boundary motion and simultaneously\nperform multitask learning for VSOD and object motion prediction, which can\nfurther facilitate the model to extract spatiotemporal features accurately and\nmaintain the object integrity. Extensive experiments on several datasets\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of our method and can achieve state-of-the-art\nmetrics on some datasets.

But we find existing graph-based methods in the\nvisible-infrared person re-identification task (VI-ReID) suffer from bad\ngeneralization because of two issues: 1) train-test modality balance gap, which\nis a property of VI-ReID task. The number of two modalities data are balanced\nin the training stage, but extremely unbalanced in inference, causing the low\ngeneralization of graph-based VI-ReID methods. 2) sub-optimal topology\nstructure caused by the end-to-end learning manner to the graph module. We\nanalyze that the well-trained input features weaken the learning of graph\ntopology, making it not generalized enough during the inference process. In\nthis paper, we propose a Counterfactual Intervention Feature Transfer (CIFT)\nmethod to tackle these problems. Specifically, a Homogeneous and Heterogeneous\nFeature Transfer (H2FT) is designed to reduce the train-test modality balance\ngap by two independent types of well-designed graph modules and an unbalanced\nscenario simulation. Besides, a Counterfactual Relation Intervention (CRI) is\nproposed to utilize the counterfactual intervention and causal effect tools to\nhighlight the role of topology structure in the whole training process, which\nmakes the graph topology structure more reliable.

    "abstract": "Information spread is an intriguing topic to study in network science, which\ninvestigates how information, influence, or contagion propagate through\nnetworks. Graph burning is a simplified deterministic model for how information\nspreads within networks. The complicated NP-complete nature of the problem\nmakes it computationally difficult to solve using exact algorithms.\nAccordingly, a number of heuristics and approximation algorithms have been\nproposed in the literature for the graph burning problem. In this paper, we\npropose an efficient genetic algorithm called Centrality BAsed\nGenetic-algorithm (CBAG) for solving the graph burning problem. Considering the\nunique characteristics of the graph burning problem, we introduce novel genetic\noperators, chromosome representation, and evaluation method. In the proposed\nalgorithm, the well-known betweenness centrality is used as the backbone of our\nchromosome initialization procedure. The proposed algorithm is implemented and\ncompared with previous heuristics and approximation algorithms on 15 benchmark\ngraphs of different sizes. Based on the results, it can be seen that the\nproposed algorithm achieves better performance in comparison to the previous\nstate-of-the-art heuristics. The complete source code is available online and\ncan be used to find optimal or near-optimal solutions for the graph burning\nproblem.",

    "abstract": "The ability to reason about changes in the environment is crucial for robots\noperating over extended periods of time. Agents are expected to capture changes\nduring operation so that actions can be followed to ensure a smooth progression\nof the working session. However, varying viewing angles and accumulated\nlocalization errors make it easy for robots to falsely detect changes in the\nsurrounding world due to low observation overlap and drifted object\nassociations. In this paper, based on the recently proposed category-level\nNeural Descriptor Fields (NDFs), we develop an object-level online change\ndetection approach that is robust to partially overlapping observations and\nnoisy localization results. Utilizing the shape completion capability and\nSE(3)-equivariance of NDFs, we represent objects with compact shape codes\nencoding full object shapes from partial observations. The objects are then\norganized in a spatial tree structure based on object centers recovered from\nNDFs for fast queries of object neighborhoods. By associating objects via shape\ncode similarity and comparing local object-neighbor spatial layout, our\nproposed approach demonstrates robustness to low observation overlap and\nlocalization noises. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world\nsequences and achieve improved change detection results compared to multiple\nbaseline methods.

    "abstract": "While pretrained language models (PLMs) primarily serve as general purpose\ntext encoders that can be fine-tuned for a wide variety of downstream tasks,\nrecent work has shown that they can also be rewired to produce high-quality\nword representations (i.e., static word embeddings) and yield good performance\nin type-level lexical tasks. While existing work primarily focused on lexical\nspecialization of PLMs in monolingual and bilingual settings, in this work we\nexpose massively multilingual transformers (MMTs, e.g., mBERT or XLM-R) to\nmultilingual lexical knowledge at scale, leveraging BabelNet as the readily\navailable rich source of multilingual and cross-lingual type-level lexical\nknowledge. Concretely, we leverage BabelNet's multilingual synsets to create\nsynonym pairs across $50$ languages and then subject the MMTs (mBERT and XLM-R)\nto a lexical specialization procedure guided by a contrastive objective. We\nshow that such massively multilingual lexical specialization brings massive\ngains in two standard cross-lingual lexical tasks, bilingual lexicon induction\nand cross-lingual word similarity, as well as in cross-lingual sentence\nretrieval. Crucially, we observe gains for languages unseen in specialization,\nindicating that the multilingual lexical specialization enables generalization\nto languages with no lexical constraints. In a series of subsequent controlled\nexperiments, we demonstrate that the pretraining quality of word\nrepresentations in the MMT for languages involved in specialization has a much\nlarger effect on performance than the linguistic diversity of the set of\nconstraints. Encouragingly, this suggests that lexical tasks involving\nlow-resource languages benefit the most from lexical knowledge of resource-rich\nlanguages, generally much more available.",

As such, the sought architecture should be able to build\nsymbols for objects such as single objects that can be grasped, object stacks\nthat cannot be grasped together, or other composite dynamic structures.

However, 3D\ncardiac motion estimation is challenging because the acquired cine CMR images\nare usually 2D slices which limit the accurate estimation of through-plane\nmotion.

In the proposed method, a hybrid 2D/3D network is built to generate\ndense 3D motion fields by learning fused representations from multi-view\nimages. To ensure that the motion estimation is consistent in 3D, a shape\nregularization module is introduced during training, where shape information\nfrom multi-view images is exploited to provide weak supervision to 3D motion\nestimation.

    "abstract": "Amplitude filtering is concerned with identifying basis-states in a\nsuperposition whose amplitudes are greater than a specified threshold;\nprobability filtering is defined analogously for probabilities. Given the\nscarcity of qubits, the focus of this work is to design log-space algorithms\nfor them. Both algorithms follow a similar pattern of estimating the amplitude\n(or, probability for the latter problem) of each state, in superposition, then\ncomparing each estimate against the threshold for setting up a flag qubit upon\nsuccess, finally followed by amplitude amplification of states in which the\nflag is set. We show how to implement each step using very few qubits by\ndesigning three subroutines. Our first algorithm performs amplitude\namplification even when the \"good state\" operator has a small probability of\nbeing incorrect -- here we improve upon the space complexity of the previously\nknown algorithms. Our second algorithm performs \"true amplitude estimation\" in\nroughly the same complexity as that of \"amplitude estimation\", which actually\nestimates a probability instead of an amplitude. Our third algorithm is for\nperforming amplitude estimation in parallel (superposition) which is difficult\nwhen each estimation branch involves different oracles. As an immediate reward,\nwe observed that the above algorithms for the filtering problems directly\nimproved the upper bounds of problems such as non-linearity estimation and\n$k$-distinctness.",

For this purpose, a paired series of high-\nand low-resolution images have been collected to train a deep neural network\nmodel that can predict image residuals required to improve the resolution of\nthe input images. A modified version of the U-net neural network model has been\ntailored to find the relationship between the low resolution and residual\nimages. After training for 900 epochs on an augmented dataset of 1000 images,\nthe relative mean squared error of 0.003 is achieved for the prediction of 320\ntest images. The proposed method has not only improved the contrast of the\nlow-resolution images at the edges of cells but added critical details and\ntextures that mimic high-resolution images of placenta villous space.",

This is essentially due to the nature of the traditional combinatorial\nalgorithms, often based on a trial-and-error process. RL aims at automating\nthis process. At this regard, this paper focuses on the application of RL for\nthe Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a famous combinatorial problem that belongs\nto the class of NP-Hard problems. In this work, first, the problem is modeled\nas a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and then the PPO method (which belongs to\nthe Actor-Critic class of Reinforcement learning methods) is applied. In a\nsecond phase, the neural architecture behind the Actor and Critic has been\nestablished, choosing to adopt a neural architecture based on the Convolutional\nneural networks, both for the Actor and the Critic. This choice resulted in\neffectively addressing problems of different sizes. Experiments performed on a\nwide range of instances show that the algorithm has good generalization\ncapabilities and can reach good solutions in a short time.

    "abstract": "The notion of rank decomposition of a multi-parameter persistence module was\nintroduced as a way of constructing complete and discrete representations of\nthe rank invariant of the module. In particular, the minimal rank decomposition\nby rectangles of a persistence module, also known as the generalized\npersistence diagram, gives a uniquely defined representation of the rank\ninvariant of the module by a pair of rectangle-decomposable modules. This pair\nis interpreted as a signed barcode, with the rectangle summands of the first\n(resp. second) module playing the role of the positive (resp. negative) bars.\nThe minimal rank decomposition by rectangles generalizes the concept of\npersistence barcode from one-parameter persistence, and, being a discrete\ninvariant, it is amenable to manipulations on a computer. However, we show that\nit is not bottleneck stable under the natural notion of signed bottleneck\nmatching between signed barcodes. To remedy this, we turn our focus to the\nsigned barcode induced by the Betti numbers of the module relative to the\nso-called rank exact structure, which we prove to be bottleneck stable under\nsigned matchings. As part of our proof, we obtain two intermediate results of\nindependent interest: we compute the global dimension of the rank exact\nstructure on the category of finitely presentable multi-parameter persistence\nmodules, and we prove a bottleneck stability result for hook-decomposable\nmodules, which are in fact the relative projective modules of the rank exact\nstructure. We also bound the size of the multigraded Betti numbers relative to\nthe rank exact structure in terms of the usual multigraded Betti numbers, we\nprove a universality result for the dissimilarity function induced by the\nnotion of signed matching, and we compute, in the two-parameter case, the\nglobal dimension of a different exact structure that is related to the upsets\nof the indexing poset.",

    "abstract": "There are many challenges associated with analysing gas chromatography - mass\nspectrometry (GC-MS) data. Many of these challenges stem from the fact that\nelectron ionisation can make it difficult to recover molecular information due\nto the high degree of fragmentation with concomitant loss of molecular ion\nsignal. With GC-MS data there are often many common fragment ions shared among\nclosely-eluting peaks, necessitating sophisticated methods for analysis. Some\nof these methods are fully automated, but make some assumptions about the data\nwhich can introduce artifacts during the analysis. Chemometric methods such as\nMultivariate Curve Resolution, or Parallel Factor Analysis are particularly\nattractive, since they are flexible and make relatively few assumptions about\nthe data - ideally resulting in fewer artifacts. These methods do require\nexpert user intervention to determine the most relevant regions of interest and\nan appropriate number of components, $k$, for each region. Automated region of\ninterest selection is needed to permit automated batch processing of\nchromatographic data with advanced signal deconvolution. Here, we propose a new\nmethod for automated, untargeted region of interest selection that accounts for\nthe multivariate information present in GC-MS data to select regions of\ninterest based on the ratio of the squared first, and second singular values\nfrom the Singular Value Decomposition of a window that moves across the\nchromatogram. Assuming that the first singular value accounts largely for\nsignal, and that the second singular value accounts largely for noise, it is\npossible to interpret the relationship between these two values as a\nprobabilistic distribution of Fisher Ratios. The sensitivity of the algorithm\nwas tested by investigating the concentration at which the algorithm can no\nlonger pick out chromatographic regions known to contain signal.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale communication networks, such as the internet, achieve the\ntransmission of information from a sender to a distant receiver by routing\npackets of data through many intermediate nodes. Classically, each packet has\nto follow a well-defined path through the network. In a quantum network,\nhowever, it is in principle possible to route information along multiple paths\nin a coherent quantum superposition. Here we develop a model of quantum\ncommunication network with coherent routing of information through multiple\nintermediate nodes. In this model, we show that the distance over which\ninformation can be transmitted reliably can be significantly extended.\nSurprisingly, this improvement takes place also for purely classical channels,\nsuch as binary asymmetric channels. In the ideal setting where the coherent\nsuperposition of paths is not affected by noise, we find that classical data\ncan be reliably transmitted at a constant rate through asymptotically long\nsequences of binary asymmetric channels, which in normal conditions would lead\nto an exponential decay of the transmission rate. In more realistic conditions\ninvolving decoherence on the paths, we find that the combined use of coherent\ncontrol on the path and local operations at intermediate nodes achieves\nsignificantly higher communication rates over finite distances.",

    "abstract": "This article is concerned with the problem of determining an unknown source\nof non-potential, external time-dependent perturbations of an incompressible\nfluid from large-scale observations on the flow field. A relaxation-based\napproach is proposed for accomplishing this, which leverages a nonlinear\nproperty of the equations of motions to asymptotically enslave small scales to\nlarge scales. In particular, an algorithm is introduced that systematically\nproduces approximations of the flow field on the unobserved scales in order to\ngenerate an approximation to the unknown force; the process is then repeated to\ngenerate an improved approximation of the unobserved scales, and so on. A\nmathematical proof of convergence of this algorithm is established in the\ncontext of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with periodic boundary\nconditions under the assumption that the force belongs to the observational\nsubspace of phase space; at each stage in the algorithm, it is shown that the\nmodel error, represented as the difference between the approximating and true\nforce, asymptotically decrements to zero in a geometric fashion provided that\nsufficiently many scales are observed and certain parameters of the algorithm\nare appropriately tuned; the issue of the sharpness of the assumptions, among\nother practical considerations such as the transient periods between updates,\nare also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals commonly suffer noise\ninterference, such as baseline wander. High-quality and high-fidelity\nreconstruction of the ECG signals is of great significance to diagnosing\ncardiovascular diseases. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel ECG baseline\nwander and noise removal technology. Methods: We extended the diffusion model\nin a conditional manner that was specific to the ECG signals, namely the Deep\nScore-Based Diffusion model for Electrocardiogram baseline wander and noise\nremoval (DeScoD-ECG). Moreover, we deployed a multi-shots averaging strategy\nthat improved signal reconstructions. We conducted the experiments on the QT\nDatabase and the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database to verify the feasibility\nof the proposed method. Baseline methods are adopted for comparison, including\ntraditional digital filter-based and deep learning-based methods. Results: The\nquantities evaluation results show that the proposed method obtained\noutstanding performance on four distance-based similarity metrics (the sum of\nsquared distance, maximum absolute square, percentage of root distance, and\ncosine similarity) with 3.771 $\\pm$ 5.713 au, 0.329 $\\pm$ 0.258 au, 40.527\n$\\pm$ 26.258 \\%, and 0.926 $\\pm$ 0.087. This led to at least 20\\% overall\nimprovement compared with the best baseline method. Conclusion: This paper\ndemonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of the DeScoD-ECG for ECG noise\nremoval, which has better approximations of the true data distribution and\nhigher stability under extreme noise corruptions. Significance: This study is\none of the first to extend the conditional diffusion-based generative model for\nECG noise removal, and the DeScoD-ECG has the potential to be widely used in\nbiomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Systematic variation is a common issue in metabolomics data analysis.\nTherefore, different scaling and normalization techniques are used to\npreprocess the data for metabolomics data analysis. Although several scaling\nmethods are available in the literature, however, choice of scaling,\ntransformation and/or normalization technique influence the further statistical\nanalysis. It is challenging to choose the appropriate scaling technique for\ndownstream analysis to get accurate results or to make a proper decision.\nMoreover, the existing scaling techniques are sensitive to outliers or extreme\nvalues. To fill the gap, our objective is to introduce a robust scaling\napproach that is not influenced by outliers as well as provides more accurate\nresults for downstream analysis. Here, we introduced a new weighted scaling\napproach that is robust against outliers however, where no additional outlier\ndetection/treatment step is needed in data preprocessing and also compared it\nwith the conventional scaling and normalization techniques through artificial\nand real metabolomics datasets. We evaluated the performance of the proposed\nmethod in comparison to the other existing conventional scaling techniques\nusing metabolomics data analysis in both the absence and presence of different\npercentages of outliers. Results show that in most cases, the proposed scaling\ntechnique performs better than the traditional scaling methods in both the\nabsence and presence of outliers.

Especially, deep neural\nnetworks based on seminal architectures such as U-shaped models with\nskip-connections or atrous convolution with pyramid pooling have been tailored\nto a wide range of medical image analysis tasks. The main advantage of such\narchitectures is that they are prone to detaining versatile local features.\nHowever, as a general consensus, CNNs fail to capture long-range dependencies\nand spatial correlations due to the intrinsic property of confined receptive\nfield size of convolution operations. Alternatively, Transformer, profiting\nfrom global information modelling that stems from the self-attention mechanism,\nhas recently attained remarkable performance in natural language processing and\ncomputer vision. Nevertheless, previous studies prove that both local and\nglobal features are critical for a deep model in dense prediction, such as\nsegmenting complicated structures with disparate shapes and configurations. To\nthis end, this paper proposes TransDeepLab, a novel DeepLab-like pure\nTransformer for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we exploit\nhierarchical Swin-Transformer with shifted windows to extend the DeepLabv3 and\nmodel the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module. A thorough search of\nthe relevant literature yielded that we are the first to model the seminal\nDeepLab model with a pure Transformer-based model. Extensive experiments on\nvarious medical image segmentation tasks verify that our approach performs\nsuperior or on par with most contemporary works on an amalgamation of Vision\nTransformer and CNN-based methods, along with a significant reduction of model\ncomplexity.

It is relevant to various real-world\napplications such as finance and management. To solve the optimal stopping\nproblem, state-of-the-art algorithms in dynamic programming, such as the\nleast-squares Monte Carlo (LSMC), are employed. This type of algorithm relies\non path simulations using only the last price of the underlying asset as a\nstate representation. Also, the LSMC was thinking for option valuation where\nrisk-neutral probabilities can be employed to account for uncertainty. However,\nthe general optimal stopping problem goals may not fit the requirements of the\nLSMC showing auto-correlated prices. We employ a data-driven method that uses\nMonte Carlo simulation to train and test artificial neural networks (ANN) to\nsolve the optimal stopping problem. Using ANN to solve decision problems is not\nentirely new.

    "abstract": "The idea of using computers to read medical scans was introduced as early as\n1966. However, limits to machine learning technology meant progress was slow\ninitially. The Alexnet breakthrough in 2012 sparked new interest in the topic,\nwhich resulted in the release of 100s of medical AI solutions on the market. In\nspite of success for some diseases and modalities, many challenges remain.\nResearch typically focuses on the development of specific applications or\ntechniques, clinical evaluation, or meta analysis of clinical studies or\ntechniques through surveys or challenges. However, limited attention has been\ngiven to the development process of improving real world performance. In this\ntutorial, we address the latter and discuss some techniques to conduct the\ndevelopment process in order to make this as efficient as possible.",

    "abstract": "The brain tumor is the most aggressive kind of tumor and can cause low life\nexpectancy if diagnosed at the later stages. Manual identification of brain\ntumors is tedious and prone to errors. Misdiagnosis can lead to false treatment\nand thus reduce the chances of survival for the patient. Medical resonance\nimaging (MRI) is the conventional method used to diagnose brain tumors and\ntheir types. This paper attempts to eliminate the manual process from the\ndiagnosis process and use machine learning instead. We proposed the use of\npretrained convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the diagnosis and\nclassification of brain tumors. Three types of tumors were classified with one\nclass of non-tumor MRI images. Networks that has been used are ResNet50,\nEfficientNetB1, EfficientNetB7, EfficientNetV2B1. EfficientNet has shown\npromising results due to its scalable nature. EfficientNetB1 showed the best\nresults with training and validation accuracy of 87.67% and 89.55%,\nrespectively.",

Effective recognition\nof COVID-19 using advanced machine learning methods is a timely need. Although\nmany sophisticated approaches have been proposed in the recent past, they still\nstruggle to achieve expected performances in recognizing COVID-19 using chest\nX-ray images. In addition, the majority of them are involved with the complex\npre-processing task, which is often challenging and time-consuming. Meanwhile,\ndeep networks are end-to-end and have shown promising results in image-based\nrecognition tasks during the last decade. Hence, in this work, some widely used\nstate-of-the-art deep networks are evaluated for COVID-19 recognition with\nchest X-ray images. All the deep networks are evaluated on a publicly available\nchest X-ray image dataset. The evaluation results show that the deep networks\ncan effectively recognize COVID-19 from chest X-ray images.

The Kraus form ensures that the reconstructed process is\ncompletely positive. To make the process trace-preserving, we use a constrained\ngradient-descent (GD) approach on the so-called Stiefel manifold during\noptimization to obtain the Kraus operators. Our ansatz uses a few Kraus\noperators to avoid direct estimation of large process matrices, e.g., the Choi\nmatrix, for low-rank quantum processes. The GD-QPT matches the performance of\nboth compressed-sensing (CS) and projected least-squares (PLS) QPT in\nbenchmarks with two-qubit random processes, but shines by combining the best\nfeatures of these two methods. Similar to CS (but unlike PLS), GD-QPT can\nreconstruct a process from just a small number of random measurements, and\nsimilar to PLS (but unlike CS) it also works for larger system sizes, up to at\nleast five qubits. We envisage that the data-driven approach of GD-QPT can\nbecome a practical tool that greatly reduces the cost and computational effort\nfor QPT in intermediate-scale quantum systems.",

As compared to more common FSO systems exploiting the telecom range, the\nlarger wavelength employed in Mid-IR systems delivers exceptional benefits in\ncase of adverse atmospheric conditions, as the reduced scattering rate strongly\nsuppresses detrimental effects on the FSO link length given by the presence of\nrain, dust, fog and haze.

Our\nanalysis reveals the existence of two distinct noise regions, corresponding to\ndifferent realistic channel attenuation conditions, which are precisely\ncontrolled in our setup. To relate our results with real outdoor\nconfigurations, we combine experimental data with predictions of an atmospheric\nchannel loss model, finding that error-free communication could be attained for\neffective distances up to 8~km in low visibility conditions of 1 km.

    "abstract": "The progress in EEG-based emotion recognition has received widespread\nattention from the fields of human-machine interactions and cognitive science\nin recent years. However,the scarcity of high granularity and dense artificial\nlabels contributes to the bottleneck of emotion recognition with high real-time\nand granularity. Neuroscience studies have discovered exploitable stimuli\nlabels. It reveals that EEG samples recorded when subjects were triggered by\nthe same stimuli share the same stimuli label. This paper proposed a\nSelf-supervised Group Meiosis Contrastive Learning (SGMC) framework to exploit\nsuch stimuli labels for emotion recognition. The SGMC adopts a genetic inspired\ndata augmentation method Meiosis. It achieves augmenting a group of samples\nsharing the same stimuli label to generate two augmented groups by pairing,\ncross exchanging, and separating. A group-projector-based model is adopted. The\nmodel achieves extracting a group-level representation by extracting individual\nrepresentations from a group and aggregating them into a group-level\nrepresentation. Contrastive learning is employed to maximize the similarity of\ngroup-level representations of augmented groups sharing the same stimuli label.\nThe SGMC achieved the state-of-the-art results on the publicly available DEAP\ndataset with an accuracy of 94.72% and 95.68% in valence and arousal\ndimensions. Especially the SGMC shows more excellent performance on limited\nlabeled sample learning. In addition, we verified the rationality of the\nframework design by control experiment and ablation study, and investigated the\ncause of the formation of good performance by feature visualization, and hyper\nparametric analysis.

The framework consists of two stages; the\nfirst stage involves constructing efficient models named EEGNet, which is\ninspired by the state-of-the-art efficient architecture and employs\ninverted-residual blocks that contain depthwise separable convolutional layers.\nThe EEGNet models on both valence and arousal labels achieve the average\nclassification accuracy of 90%, 96.6%, and 99.5% with only 6.4k, 14k, and 25k\nparameters, respectively.

Most approaches\nutilised RGB or RGB-D cameras to obtain motion data, while a few employed\naccelerometers or inertial measurement units. In this paper, within a\nprospective longitudinal infant cohort study applying a multimodal approach for\nmovement tracking and analyses, we examined for the first time the performance\nof pressure sensors for classifying an infant general movements pattern, the\nfidgety movements. We developed an algorithm to encode movements with pressure\ndata from a 32x32 grid mat with 1024 sensors. Multiple neural network\narchitectures were investigated to distinguish presence vs. absence of the\nfidgety movements, including the feed-forward networks (FFNs) with manually\ndefined statistical features and the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with\nlearned features. The CNN with multiple convolutional layers and learned\nfeatures outperformed the FFN with manually defined statistical features, with\nclassification accuracy of $81.4\\%$ and $75.6\\%$, respectively. We compared the\npros and cons of the pressure sensing approach to the video-based and inertial\nmotion senor-based approaches for analysing infant movements. The\nnon-intrusive, extremely easy-to-use pressure sensing approach has great\npotential for efficient large-scaled movement data acquisition across cites and\nfor application in busy daily clinical routines for evaluating infant\nneuromotor functions.

First, we estimate local Gaussian blur\nkernels for overlapping patches and sharpen them with a non-blind deblurring\ntechnique.

Second,\nwe remove the remaining lateral chromatic aberrations (not contemplated in the\nfirst step) with a convolutional neural network, trained to minimize the\nred/green and blue/green residual images. Experiments on both synthetic and\nreal images show that the combination of these two stages yields a fast\nstate-of-the-art blind optical aberration compensation technique that competes\nwith commercial non-blind algorithms.",

    "title": "An Adjoint-Free Algorithm for CNOP via Sampling",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a sampling algorithm based on statistical machine\nlearning to obtain conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation (CNOP), which is\nessentially different from the traditional deterministic optimization methods.\nThe new approach does not only reduce the extremely expensive gradient\n(first-order) information directly by the objective value (zeroth-order)\ninformation, but also avoid the use of adjoint technique that gives rise to the\nhuge storage problem and the instability from linearization. Meanwhile, an\nintuitive anlysis and a rigorous concentration inequality for the approximate\ngradient by sampling are shown. The numerical experiments to obtain the CNOPs\nby the performance of standard spatial sturctures for a theoretical model,\nBurgers equation with small viscosity, demonstrate that at the cost of losing\naccuracy, fewer samples spend time relatively shorter than the adjoint-based\nmethod and directly from definition. Finally, we reveal that the nonlinear time\nevolution of the CNOPs obtained by all the algorithms are almost consistent\nwith the quantity of norm square of perturbations, their difference and\nrelative difference on the basis of the definition method.",

    "abstract": "Understanding extreme events and their probability is key for the study of\nclimate change impacts, risk assessment, adaptation, and the protection of\nliving beings. In this work we develop a methodology to build forecasting\nmodels for extreme heatwaves. These models are based on convolutional neural\nnetworks, trained on extremely long 8,000-year climate model outputs. Because\nthe relation between extreme events is intrinsically probabilistic, we\nemphasise probabilistic forecast and validation. We demonstrate that deep\nneural networks are suitable for this purpose for long lasting 14-day heatwaves\nover France, up to 15 days ahead of time for fast dynamical drivers (500 hPa\ngeopotential height fields), and also at much longer lead times for slow\nphysical drivers (soil moisture). The method is easily implemented and\nversatile. We find that the deep neural network selects extreme heatwaves\nassociated with a North-Hemisphere wavenumber-3 pattern. We find that the 2\nmeter temperature field does not contain any new useful statistical information\nfor heatwave forecast, when added to the 500 hPa geopotential height and soil\nmoisture fields. The main scientific message is that training deep neural\nnetworks for predicting extreme heatwaves occurs in a regime of drastic lack of\ndata. We suggest that this is likely the case for most other applications to\nlarge scale atmosphere and climate phenomena. We discuss perspectives for\ndealing with the lack of data regime, for instance rare event simulations, and\nhow transfer learning may play a role in this latter task.",

    "abstract": "The performances of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems degrade\ndrastically under noisy conditions. Explicit distortion modelling (EDM), as a\nfeature compensation step, is able to enhance ASR systems under such conditions\nby simulating the in-domain noisy speeches from the clean counterparts. Yet,\nexisting distortion models are either non-trainable or unexplainable and often\nlack controllability and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a\nfully explainable and controllable model: DENT-DDSP to achieve EDM. DENT-DDSP\nutilizes novel differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) components and\nrequires only 10 seconds of training data to achieve high fidelity. The\nexperiment shows that the simulated noisy data from DENT-DDSP achieves the\nhighest simulation fidelity compared to other baseline models in terms of\nmulti-scale spectral loss (MSSL). Moreover, to validate whether the data\nsimulated by DENT-DDSP are able to replace the scarce in-domain noisy data in\nthe noise-robust ASR tasks, several downstream ASR models with the same\narchitecture are trained using the simulated data and the real data. The\nexperiment shows that the model trained with the simulated noisy data from\nDENT-DDSP achieves similar performances to the benchmark with a 2.7\\%\ndifference in terms of word error rate (WER). The code of the model is released\nonline.",

    "abstract": "Despite their success, understanding how convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\ncan efficiently learn high-dimensional functions remains a fundamental\nchallenge. A popular belief is that these models harness the compositional and\nhierarchical structure of natural data such as images. Yet, we lack a\nquantitative understanding of how such structure affects performances, e.g. the\nrate of decay of the generalisation error with the number of training samples.\nIn this paper we study deep CNNs in the kernel regime: i) we show that the\nspectrum of the corresponding kernel and its asymptotics inherit the\nhierarchical structure of the network; ii) we use generalisation bounds to\nprove that deep CNNs adapt to the spatial scale of the target function; iii) we\nillustrate this result by computing the rate of decay of the error in a\nteacher-student setting, where a deep CNN is trained on the output of another\ndeep CNN with randomly-initialised parameters. We find that if the teacher\nfunction depends on certain low-dimensional subsets of the input variables,\nthen the rate is controlled by the effective dimensionality of these subsets.\nConversely, if the teacher function depends on the full set of input variables,\nthen the error rate is inversely proportional to the input dimension.\nInterestingly, this implies that despite their hierarchical structure, the\nfunctions generated by deep CNNs are too rich to be efficiently learnable in\nhigh dimension.",
