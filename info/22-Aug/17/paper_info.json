    "abstract": "In second-order uncertain Bayesian networks, the conditional probabilities\nare only known within distributions, i.e., probabilities over probabilities.\nThe delta-method has been applied to extend exact first-order inference methods\nto propagate both means and variances through sum-product networks derived from\nBayesian networks, thereby characterizing epistemic uncertainty, or the\nuncertainty in the model itself. Alternatively, second-order belief propagation\nhas been demonstrated for polytrees but not for general directed acyclic graph\nstructures. In this work, we extend Loopy Belief Propagation to the setting of\nsecond-order Bayesian networks, giving rise to Second-Order Loopy Belief\nPropagation (SOLBP). For second-order Bayesian networks, SOLBP generates\ninferences consistent with those generated by sum-product networks, while being\nmore computationally efficient and scalable.",

Standard authorship attribution techniques that analyze candidate\nauthors' writing styles achieve uncomfortably high accuracy even when the\nnumber of candidate authors is high. Adversarial stylometry defends against\nauthorship attribution with the goal of preventing unwanted deanonymization.\nThis paper reproduces and replicates experiments in a seminal study of defenses\nagainst authorship attribution (Brennan et al., 2012). We are able to\nsuccessfully reproduce and replicate the original results, although we conclude\nthat the effectiveness of the defenses studied is overstated due to a lack of a\ncontrol group in the original study. In our replication, we find new evidence\nsuggesting that an entirely automatic method, round-trip translation, merits\nre-examination as it appears to reduce the effectiveness of established\nauthorship attribution methods.",

    "abstract": "Mimicking vascular systems in living beings, designers have realized\nmicrovascular composites to achieve thermal regulation and other\nfunctionalities, such as electromagnetic modulation, sensing, and healing. Such\nmaterial systems with mentioned functionalities benefit various aerospace,\nmilitary, and civilian applications. Although heat transfer is a mature field,\ncontrol of thermal characteristics in synthetic microvascular systems is new,\nand the fundamental comprehension is hazy. What will benefit designers are\npredictive mathematical models and an in-depth qualitative understanding of\nvasculature-based active cooling/heating. So, the central focus of this paper\nis to address the remarked knowledge gap. First, we present a reduced-order\nmodel with broad applicability, allowing the inlet temperature to differ from\nthe ambient temperature. Second, we use mathematical analysis tools for this\nreduced-order model and reveal many heat transfer properties in\nfluid-sequestered vasculature systems. We derive point-wise properties\n(minimum, maximum, and comparison principles) and global properties (such as\nbounds on performance metrics such as the mean surface temperature and cooling\nefficiency). These newfound results deepen our understanding of active\ncooling/heating and propel the perfecting of thermal regulation systems.",

The latter takes uncertainty into account, but not the reliability of\nthe uncertainty estimates (so to say, the \"uncertainty about the uncertainty\").\nMore generally, much remains unknown about how to best combine probabilistic\nestimates from multiple sources. In this paper, we investigate a number of\nalternative prediction methods. Our methods are inspired by the theories of\nprobability, belief functions and reliable classification, as well as a\nprinciple that we call evidence accumulation. Our experiments on a variety of\ndata sets are based on random decision trees which guarantees a high diversity\nin the predictions to be combined.

    "abstract": "Dental disease is one of the most common chronic diseases despite being\nlargely preventable. However, professional advice on optimal oral hygiene\npractices is often forgotten or abandoned by patients. Therefore patients may\nbenefit from timely and personalized encouragement to engage in oral self-care\nbehaviors. In this paper, we develop an online reinforcement learning (RL)\nalgorithm for use in optimizing the delivery of mobile-based prompts to\nencourage oral hygiene behaviors. One of the main challenges in developing such\nan algorithm is ensuring that the algorithm considers the impact of the current\naction on the effectiveness of future actions (i.e., delayed effects),\nespecially when the algorithm has been made simple in order to run stably and\nautonomously in a constrained, real-world setting (i.e., highly noisy, sparse\ndata). We address this challenge by designing a quality reward which maximizes\nthe desired health outcome (i.e., high-quality brushing) while minimizing user\nburden. We also highlight a procedure for optimizing the hyperparameters of the\nreward by building a simulation environment test bed and evaluating candidates\nusing the test bed. The RL algorithm discussed in this paper will be deployed\nin Oralytics, an oral self-care app that provides behavioral strategies to\nboost patient engagement in oral hygiene practices.",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is an essential technique in improving the generalization\nof deep neural networks. The majority of existing image-domain augmentations\neither rely on geometric and structural transformations, or apply different\nkinds of photometric distortions. In this paper, we propose an effective\ntechnique for image augmentation by injecting contextually meaningful knowledge\ninto the scenes. Our method of semantically meaningful image augmentation for\nobject detection via language grounding, SemAug, starts by calculating\nsemantically appropriate new objects that can be placed into relevant locations\nin the image (the what and where problems). Then it embeds these objects into\ntheir relevant target locations, thereby promoting diversity of object instance\ndistribution. Our method allows for introducing new object instances and\ncategories that may not even exist in the training set. Furthermore, it does\nnot require the additional overhead of training a context network, so it can be\neasily added to existing architectures. Our comprehensive set of evaluations\nshowed that the proposed method is very effective in improving the\ngeneralization, while the overhead is negligible. In particular, for a wide\nrange of model architectures, our method achieved ~2-4% and ~1-2% mAP\nimprovements for the task of object detection on the Pascal VOC and COCO\ndatasets, respectively.",

Then we answer the projected queries using a simple\nnoise-adding mechanism, and lift the answers up to the original dimension.\nUsing this method, we give, for the first time, purely differentially private\nmechanisms with optimal worst case sample complexity under average error for\nanswering a workload of $k$ queries over a universe of size $N$. As other\napplications, we give the first purely private efficient mechanisms with\noptimal sample complexity for computing the covariance of a bounded\nhigh-dimensional distribution, and for answering 2-way marginal queries.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has become the method of choice to tackle real-world problems\nin different domains, partly because of its ability to learn from data and\nachieve impressive performance on a wide range of applications. However, its\nsuccess usually relies on two assumptions: (i) vast troves of labeled datasets\nare required for accurate model fitting, and (ii) training and testing data are\nindependent and identically distributed. Its performance on unseen target\ndomains, thus, is not guaranteed, especially when encountering\nout-of-distribution data at the adaptation stage. The performance drop on data\nin a target domain is a critical problem in deploying deep neural networks that\nare successfully trained on data in a source domain. Unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA) is proposed to counter this, by leveraging both labeled source\ndomain data and unlabeled target domain data to carry out various tasks in the\ntarget domain. UDA has yielded promising results on natural image processing,\nvideo analysis, natural language processing, time-series data analysis, medical\nimage analysis, etc. In this review, as a rapidly evolving topic, we provide a\nsystematic comparison of its methods and applications. In addition, the\nconnection of UDA with its closely related tasks, e.g., domain generalization\nand out-of-distribution detection, has also been discussed.

State-of-the-art approaches heavily\nrely on visual information collected with the front camera of the ego-vehicle\nto make a prediction of the pedestrian's intention. As such, the performance of\nexisting methods significantly degrades when the visual information is not\naccurate, e.g., when the distance between the pedestrian and ego-vehicle is\nfar, or the lighting conditions are not good enough. In this paper, we design,\nimplement, and evaluate the first pedestrian intention prediction model based\non integration of motion sensor data gathered with the smartwatch (or\nsmartphone) of the pedestrian.

    "abstract": "Invariant inference algorithms such as interpolation-based inference and\nIC3/PDR show that it is feasible, in practice, to find inductive invariants for\nmany interesting systems, but non-trivial upper bounds on the computational\ncomplexity of such algorithms are scarce, and limited to simple syntactic forms\nof invariants. In this paper we achieve invariant inference algorithms, in the\ndomain of propositional transition systems, with provable upper bounds on the\nnumber of SAT calls. We do this by building on the monotone theory, developed\nby Bshouty for exact learning Boolean formulas. We prove results for two\ninvariant inference frameworks: (i) model-based interpolation, where we show an\nalgorithm that, under certain conditions about reachability, efficiently infers\ninvariants when they have both short CNF and DNF representations (transcending\nprevious results about monotone invariants); and (ii) abstract interpretation\nin a domain based on the monotone theory that was previously studied in\nrelation to property-directed reachability, where we propose an efficient\nimplementation of the best abstract transformer, leading to overall complexity\nbounds on the number of SAT calls. These results build on a novel procedure for\ncomputing least monotone overapproximations.",

    "abstract": "We study p-Laplacians and spectral clustering for a recently proposed\nhypergraph model that incorporates edge-dependent vertex weights (EDVWs). These\nweights can reflect different importance of vertices within a hyperedge, thus\nconferring the hypergraph model higher expressivity and flexibility. By\nconstructing submodular EDVWs-based splitting functions, we convert hypergraphs\nwith EDVWs into submodular hypergraphs for which the spectral theory is better\ndeveloped. In this way, existing concepts and theorems such as p-Laplacians and\nCheeger inequalities proposed under the submodular hypergraph setting can be\ndirectly extended to hypergraphs with EDVWs. For submodular hypergraphs with\nEDVWs-based splitting functions, we propose an efficient algorithm to compute\nthe eigenvector associated with the second smallest eigenvalue of the\nhypergraph 1-Laplacian. We then utilize this eigenvector to cluster the\nvertices, achieving higher clustering accuracy than traditional spectral\nclustering based on the 2-Laplacian. More broadly, the proposed algorithm works\nfor all submodular hypergraphs that are graph reducible. Numerical experiments\nusing real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of combining spectral\nclustering based on the 1-Laplacian and EDVWs.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new graph neural network (GNN) module, based on relaxations of\nrecently proposed geometric scattering transforms, which consist of a cascade\nof graph wavelet filters. Our learnable geometric scattering (LEGS) module\nenables adaptive tuning of the wavelets to encourage band-pass features to\nemerge in learned representations. The incorporation of our LEGS-module in GNNs\nenables the learning of longer-range graph relations compared to many popular\nGNNs, which often rely on encoding graph structure via smoothness or similarity\nbetween neighbors. Further, its wavelet priors result in simplified\narchitectures with significantly fewer learned parameters compared to competing\nGNNs. We demonstrate the predictive performance of LEGS-based networks on graph\nclassification benchmarks, as well as the descriptive quality of their learned\nfeatures in biochemical graph data exploration tasks.

In the field of visual SLAM, bag of words\n(BoW) has achieved great success in loop closure. The BoW features for loop\nsearching can also be used in the subsequent 6-DoF loop correction. However,\nfor 3D LiDAR SLAM, the state-of-the-art methods may fail to effectively\nrecognize the loop in real time, and usually cannot correct the full 6-DoF loop\npose. To address this limitation, we present a novel Bag of Words for real-time\nloop closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM, called BoW3D.

Oblivious RAM is a cryptographic\nprimitive that provides confidentiality of access patterns in remote storage\nsettings. To outsource a database of $n$ blocks of $B$ bits, traditional\nsolutions restrict the client to $\\mathcal{O}(B)$ bits of private memory. A\nclass of solutions, known as Hierarchical ORAM, has achieved theoretically\noptimal bandwidth performance in this setting. Hierarchical ORAM distributes\ndata blocks at the server across a hierarchy of hash tables, with the most\nrecently accessed blocks in the lower levels of the hierarchy. Locating a block\nin the hierarchy requires a large number of round-trips of communication, with\nthe server, per virtual access. Furthermore, rebuilding the hierarchy incurs a\nlarge concrete bandwidth overhead. Thus, Hierarchical ORAMs are seen as\ntheoretical artefacts and have not been deployed in practice.\nFor many applications, such as cloud storage, the client can afford a larger,\n$\\omega(B)$-bit, private memory allocation. With this premise, we introduce\nRank ORAM, the first practical Hierarchical ORAM that takes advantage of a\nlarger client. We construct a compact client-side data structure that keeps\ntrack of how recently data blocks have been accessed. Leveraging this\ninformation, Rank ORAM reduces both the number of round-trips of communication\nand the concrete bandwidth overhead of Hierarchical ORAM. In addition, Rank\nORAM achieves a smaller client memory allocation than existing\n(non-Hierarchical) state-of-the-art practical ORAM schemes while maintaining\ncomparable bandwidth performance.

    "abstract": "Horizontal federated learning (HFL) enables distributed clients to train a\nshared model and keep their data privacy. In training high-quality HFL models,\nthe data heterogeneity among clients is one of the major concerns. However, due\nto the security issue and the complexity of deep learning models, it is\nchallenging to investigate data heterogeneity across different clients. To\naddress this issue, based on a requirement analysis we developed a visual\nanalytics tool, HetVis, for participating clients to explore data\nheterogeneity. We identify data heterogeneity through comparing prediction\nbehaviors of the global federated model and the stand-alone model trained with\nlocal data. Then, a context-aware clustering of the inconsistent records is\ndone, to provide a summary of data heterogeneity. Combining with the proposed\ncomparison techniques, we develop a novel set of visualizations to identify\nheterogeneity issues in HFL. We designed three case studies to introduce how\nHetVis can assist client analysts in understanding different types of\nheterogeneity issues. Expert reviews and a comparative study demonstrate the\neffectiveness of HetVis.",

    "title": "Temporal Action Localization with Multi-temporal Scales",
    "abstract": "Temporal action localization plays an important role in video analysis, which\naims to localize and classify actions in untrimmed videos. The previous methods\noften predict actions on a feature space of a single-temporal scale. However,\nthe temporal features of a low-level scale lack enough semantics for action\nclassification while a high-level scale cannot provide rich details of the\naction boundaries. To address this issue, we propose to predict actions on a\nfeature space of multi-temporal scales. Specifically, we use refined feature\npyramids of different scales to pass semantics from high-level scales to\nlow-level scales. Besides, to establish the long temporal scale of the entire\nvideo, we use a spatial-temporal transformer encoder to capture the long-range\ndependencies of video frames. Then the refined features with long-range\ndependencies are fed into a classifier for the coarse action prediction.\nFinally, to further improve the prediction accuracy, we propose to use a\nframe-level self attention module to refine the classification and boundaries\nof each action instance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method\ncan outperform state-of-the-art approaches on the THUMOS14 dataset and achieves\ncomparable performance on the ActivityNet1.3 dataset. Compared with A2Net\n(TIP20, Avg\\{0.3:0.7\\}), Sub-Action (CSVT2022, Avg\\{0.1:0.5\\}), and AFSD\n(CVPR21, Avg\\{0.3:0.7\\}) on the THUMOS14 dataset, the proposed method can\nachieve improvements of 12.6\\%, 17.4\\% and 2.2\\%, respectively",

    "abstract": "Social media platforms struggle to protect users from harmful content through\ncontent moderation. These platforms have recently leveraged machine learning\nmodels to cope with the vast amount of user-generated content daily. Since\nmoderation policies vary depending on countries and types of products, it is\ncommon to train and deploy the models per policy. However, this approach is\nhighly inefficient, especially when the policies change, requiring dataset\nre-labeling and model re-training on the shifted data distribution. To\nalleviate this cost inefficiency, social media platforms often employ\nthird-party content moderation services that provide prediction scores of\nmultiple subtasks, such as predicting the existence of underage personnel, rude\ngestures, or weapons, instead of directly providing final moderation decisions.\nHowever, making a reliable automated moderation decision from the prediction\nscores of the multiple subtasks for a specific target policy has not been\nwidely explored yet. In this study, we formulate real-world scenarios of\ncontent moderation and introduce a simple yet effective threshold optimization\nmethod that searches the optimal thresholds of the multiple subtasks to make a\nreliable moderation decision in a cost-effective way. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach shows better performance in content moderation\ncompared to existing threshold optimization methods and heuristics.",

These features can be\none-dimensional or points in the environment, and can have spatial correlation,\ni.e., visiting a feature in the environment may provide a portion of the reward\nassociated with a correlated feature. A robot incurs costs as it traverses the\nenvironment, and the total cost for its route is limited by a resource\nconstraint such as battery life or operation time. As environments are often\nlarge, we permit multiple depots where the robots must start and end their\nroutes. The CAOP generalizes the correlated orienteering problem (COP), where\nthe rewards are only associated with point features, and the arc orienteering\nproblem (AOP), where the rewards are not spatially correlated. We formulate a\nmixed integer quadratic program (MIQP) that formalizes the problem and gives\noptimal solutions.

The approach is based on a simple\nbut powerful observation: in a KG, preference models can be re-targeted to\nrecommend not only entities of a single base entity type (e.g., papers in the\nscientific literature KG, products in an e-commerce KG), but also all other\ntypes (e.g., authors, conferences, institutions; sellers, buyers). We implement\nour technique in a novel system, FeedLens, which is built over Semantic\nScholar, a production system for navigating the scientific literature KG.\nFeedLens reuses the existing preference models on Semantic Scholar -- people's\ncurated research feeds -- as lenses for exploratory search. Semantic Scholar\nusers can curate multiple feeds/lenses for different topics of interest, e.g.,\none for human-centered AI and another for document embeddings. Although these\nlenses are defined in terms of papers, FeedLens re-purposes them to also guide\nsearch over authors, institutions, venues, etc. Our system design is based on\nfeedback from intended users via two pilot surveys (n=17 and n=13,\nrespectively).

    "abstract": "In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) assisted mobile edge\ncomputing systems have been exploited by researchers as a promising solution\nfor providing computation services to mobile users outside of terrestrial\ninfrastructure coverage. However, it remains challenging for the standalone\nMEC-enabled UAVs in order to meet the computation requirement of numerous\nmobile users due to the limited computation capacity of their onboard servers\nand battery lives. Therefore, we propose a collaborative scheme among UAVs so\nthat UAVs can share the workload with idle UAVs. Moreover, current task\noffloading strategies frequently overlook task topology, which may result in\npoor performance or even system failure. To address the problem, we consider\noffloading tasks consisting of a set of sub-tasks, and each sub-task has\ndependencies on other sub-tasks, which is practical in the real world.\nSub-tasks with dependencies need to wait for the resulting signal from\npreceding sub-tasks before being executed. This mechanism has serious effects\non the offloading strategy. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to\nminimize the average latency experienced by users by jointly controlling the\noffloading decision for dependent tasks and allocating the communication\nresources of UAVs. The formulated problem appears to be NP-hard and cannot be\nsolved in polynomial time. Therefore, we divide the problem into two\nsub-problems: the offloading decision problem and the communication resource\nallocation problem. Then a meta-heuristic method is proposed to find the\nsub-optimal solution of the task offloading problem, while the communication\nresource allocation problem is solved by using convex optimization. Finally, we\nperform substantial simulation experiments, and the result shows that the\nproposed offloading technique effectively minimizes the average latency of\nusers, compared with other benchmark schemes.",

    "abstract": "This work concerns the minimization of the pseudospectral abscissa of a\nmatrix-valued function dependent on parameters analytically. The problem is\nmotivated by robust stability and transient behavior considerations for a\nlinear control system that has optimization parameters. We describe a subspace\nprocedure to cope with the setting when the matrix-valued function is of large\nsize. The proposed subspace procedure solves a sequence of reduced problems\nobtained by restricting the matrix-valued function to small subspaces, whose\ndimensions increase gradually. It possesses desirable features such as the\nglobal convergence of the minimal values of the reduced problem to the minimal\nvalue of the original problem, and a superlinear convergence exhibited by the\ndecay in the errors of the minimizers of the reduced problems. In mathematical\nterms, the problem we consider is a large-scale nonconvex minimax eigenvalue\noptimization problem such that the eigenvalue function appears in the\nconstraint of the inner maximization problem. Devising and analyzing a subspace\nframework for the minimax eigenvalue optimization problem at hand with the\neigenvalue function in the constraint require special treatment that makes use\nof a Lagrangian and dual variables. There are notable advantages in minimizing\nthe pseudospectral abscissa over maximizing the distance to instability or\nminimizing the $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ norm; the optimized pseudospectral abscissa\nprovide quantitative information about the worst-case transient behavior, and\nthe initial guesses for the parameter values to optimize the pseudospectral\nabscissa can be arbitrary, unlike the case to optimize the distance to\ninstability and $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ norm that would normally require initial\nguesses yielding asymptotically stable systems.",

This paper aims to review\nthe existing approaches and theories to help understand and rethink the\ninteractions among human drivers toward social autonomous driving.

While\nexisting research on Learning to Rank (LTR) using Deep Neural Network (DNN) has\nachieved great success, it is somewhat limited because of its dependence on\nfine-grained labels. In practice, fine-grained labels are often expensive to\nacquire, i.e. explicit relevance judgements, or suffer from biases, i.e. click\nlogs. Compared to fine-grained labels, coarse-grained labels are easier and\ncheaper to collect. Some recent works propose utilizing only coarse-grained\nlabels for LTR tasks.

We study three specific graph families that are ubiquitous, namely\nconstant-degree graphs, power-law graphs, and expander graphs, and give the\nfirst conditional lower bounds for them. Our results show that even when\nrestricting our attention to one of these graph classes, any algorithm for\nfundamental graph problems such as distance computation or approximation or\nmaximum matching, cannot simultaneously achieve a sub-polynomial update time\nand query time. For example, we show that the same lower bounds as for general\ngraphs hold for maximum matching and ($s,t$)-distance in constant-degree\ngraphs, power-law graphs or expanders. Namely, in an $m$-edge graph, there\nexists no dynamic algorithms with both $O(m^{1/2 - \\epsilon})$ update time and\n$ O(m^{1 -\\epsilon})$ query time, for any small $\\epsilon > 0$.

    "abstract": "Significant improvement has been made on just noticeable difference (JND)\nmodelling due to the development of deep neural networks, especially for the\nrecently developed unsupervised-JND generation models. However, they have a\nmajor drawback that the generated JND is assessed in the real-world signal\ndomain instead of in the perceptual domain in the human brain. There is an\nobvious difference when JND is assessed in such two domains since the visual\nsignal in the real world is encoded before it is delivered into the brain with\nthe human visual system (HVS). Hence, we propose an HVS-inspired signal\ndegradation network for JND estimation. To achieve this, we carefully analyze\nthe HVS perceptual process in JND subjective viewing to obtain relevant\ninsights, and then design an HVS-inspired signal degradation (HVS-SD) network\nto represent the signal degradation in the HVS. On the one hand, the well\nlearnt HVS-SD enables us to assess the JND in the perceptual domain. On the\nother hand, it provides more accurate prior information for better guiding JND\ngeneration. Additionally, considering the requirement that reasonable JND\nshould not lead to visual attention shifting, a visual attention loss is\nproposed to control JND generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method achieves the SOTA performance for accurately estimating the\nredundancy of the HVS.

This work\npresents a novel manipulability domain adaptation method for the transfer of\nmanipulability information to the domain of another kinematic system.

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of user-generated online videos, Multimodal Sentiment\nAnalysis (MSA) has attracted increasing attention recently. Despite significant\nprogress, there are still two major challenges on the way towards robust MSA:\n1) inefficiency when modeling cross-modal interactions in unaligned multimodal\ndata; and 2) vulnerability to random modality feature missing which typically\noccurs in realistic settings. In this paper, we propose a generic and unified\nframework to address them, named Efficient Multimodal Transformer with\nDual-Level Feature Restoration (EMT-DLFR). Concretely, EMT employs\nutterance-level representations from each modality as the global multimodal\ncontext to interact with local unimodal features and mutually promote each\nother. It not only avoids the quadratic scaling cost of previous local-local\ncross-modal interaction methods but also leads to better performance. To\nimprove model robustness in the incomplete modality setting, on the one hand,\nDLFR performs low-level feature reconstruction to implicitly encourage the\nmodel to learn semantic information from incomplete data. On the other hand, it\ninnovatively regards complete and incomplete data as two different views of one\nsample and utilizes siamese representation learning to explicitly attract their\nhigh-level representations. Comprehensive experiments on three popular datasets\ndemonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both complete and\nincomplete modality settings.",

However,\nthe absence of the source data and the domain shift makes the predictions on\nthe target data unreliable. We propose quantifying the uncertainty in the\nsource model predictions and utilizing it to guide the target adaptation. For\nthis, we construct a probabilistic source model by incorporating priors on the\nnetwork parameters inducing a distribution over the model predictions.\nUncertainties are estimated by employing a Laplace approximation and\nincorporated to identify target data points that do not lie in the source\nmanifold and to down-weight them when maximizing the mutual information on the\ntarget data.

The relevance of this reference case of an off-grid energy\nsystem is not limited to the oil&gas industry, since it can also been seen as a\nspecial kind of electrical micro grid.

The intention is that it will serve as a basis for energy\nsystem studies and relating power system stability analyses regarding the\nintegration of renewable energy sources. This allows for comparisons of a base\ncase with different design modifications, new operational planning methods,\npower management strategies and control concepts. Examples of possible\nmodifications are the replacement of gas turbines by wind turbines, addition of\nenergy storage systems, a more variable operation of loads, etc.\nThe last part of the article demonstrates the behaviour of the reference\nplatform implemented in two software tools.

Finally, our method is highly general, as it is independent\nof the distributions of BSs and users, and the shape of network areas.

Compared with the frequently used generalized mutual information\n(GMI), the LM rate has been known as a tighter lower bound of the mismatch\ncapacity. The computation of the LM rate, however, has been a difficult task,\ndue to the fact that the LM rate involves a maximization over a function of the\nchannel input, which becomes challenging as the input alphabet size grows, and\ndirect numerical methods (e.g., interior point methods) suffer from intensive\nmemory and computational resource requirements.

In this work, we propose a novel framework KRACL to alleviate the\nwidespread sparsity in KGs with graph context and contrastive learning.\nFirstly, we propose the Knowledge Relational Attention Network (KRAT) to\nleverage the graph context by simultaneously projecting neighboring triples to\ndifferent latent spaces and jointly aggregating messages with the attention\nmechanism. KRAT is capable of capturing the subtle semantic information and\nimportance of different context triples as well as leveraging multi-hop\ninformation in knowledge graphs. Secondly, we propose the knowledge contrastive\nloss by combining the contrastive loss with cross entropy loss, which\nintroduces more negative samples and thus enriches the feedback to sparse\nentities. Our experiments demonstrate that KRACL achieves superior results\nacross various standard knowledge graph benchmarks, especially on WN18RR and\nNELL-995 which have large numbers of low in-degree entities. Extensive\nexperiments also bear out KRACL's effectiveness in handling sparse knowledge\ngraphs and robustness against noisy triples.",

    "abstract": "When we use algorithms to produce recommendations, we typically think of\nthese recommendations as providing helpful information, such as when risk\nassessments are presented to judges or doctors. But when a decision-maker\nobtains a recommendation, they may not only react to the information. The\ndecision-maker may view the recommendation as a default action, making it\ncostly for them to deviate, for example when a judge is reluctant to overrule a\nhigh-risk assessment of a defendant or a doctor fears the consequences of\ndeviating from recommended procedures. In this article, we consider the effect\nand design of recommendations when they affect choices not just by shifting\nbeliefs, but also by altering preferences. We motivate our model from\ninstitutional factors, such as a desire to avoid audits, as well as from\nwell-established models in behavioral science that predict loss aversion\nrelative to a reference point, which here is set by the algorithm. We show that\nrecommendation-dependent preferences create inefficiencies where the\ndecision-maker is overly responsive to the recommendation, which changes the\noptimal design of the algorithm towards providing less conservative\nrecommendations. As a potential remedy, we discuss an algorithm that\nstrategically withholds recommendations, and show how it can improve the\nquality of final decisions.",

As far as we know, Meta-MFW is the first algorithm to obtain\n$1/e$-regret of $O(\\sqrt{T})$ for the online non-monotone continuous\nDR-submodular maximization problem over a down-closed convex set. Furthermore,\nin sharp contrast with ODC algorithm \\citep{thang2021online}, Meta-MFW relies\non the simple online linear oracle without discretization, lifting, or rounding\noperations.

Knowledge of how humans organize and relate their\nideas and behavior within a society helps to understand their actions and\nattitudes towards different issues. However, the selection of common traits\nthat shape a cultural area is somewhat arbitrary. What is needed is a method\nthat can leverage the massive amounts of data coming online, especially through\nsocial media, to identify cultural regions without ad-hoc assumptions, biases\nor prejudices. In this work, we take a crucial step towards this direction by\nintroducing a method to infer cultural regions based on the automatic analysis\nof large datasets from microblogging posts. Our approach is based on the\nprinciple that cultural affiliation can be inferred from the topics that people\ndiscuss among themselves. Specifically, we measure regional variations in\nwritten discourse generated in American social media. From the frequency\ndistributions of content words in geotagged Tweets, we find the words' usage\nregional hotspots, and from there we derive principal components of regional\nvariation. Through a hierarchical clustering of the data in this\nlower-dimensional space, our method yields clear cultural areas and the topics\nof discussion that define them. We obtain a manifest North-South separation,\nwhich is primarily influenced by the African American culture, and further\ncontiguous (East-West) and non-contiguous (urban-rural) divisions that provide\na comprehensive picture of today's cultural areas in the US.",

Atomic multicast is its natural generalization\nwhere each message $m$ is addressed to $dst(m)$, a subset of the processes\ncalled its destination group. A solution to atomic multicast is genuine when a\nprocess takes steps only if a message is addressed to it. Genuine solutions are\nthe ones used in practice because they have better performance.\nLet $G$ be all the destination groups and $F$ be the cyclic families in it,\nthat is the subsets of $G$ whose intersection graph is hamiltonian. This paper\nestablishes that the weakest failure detector to solve genuine atomic multicast\nis $\\mu=(\\wedge_{g,h \\in G}~\\Sigma_{g \\cap h}) \\wedge (\\wedge_{g \\in\nG}~\\Omega_g) \\wedge \\gamma$, where (i) $\\Sigma_P$ and $\\Omega_P$ are the quorum\nand leader failure detectors restricted to the processes in $P$, and (ii)\n$\\gamma$ is a new failure detector that informs the processes in a cyclic\nfamily $f \\in F$ when $f$ is faulty.\nWe also study two classical variations of atomic multicast.

In this\ncase, $\\mu$ must be strengthened with $1^{g \\cap h}$, the indicator failure\ndetector that informs each process in $g \\cup h$ when $g \\cap h$ is faulty. The\nsecond variation requires a message to be delivered when the destination group\nruns in isolation.

However, new trending methods applying\nlarge-scale pre-trained model CLIP for TVR do not focus on multi-modal cues in\nvideos. Furthermore, the traditional methods simply concatenating multi-modal\nfeatures do not exploit fine-grained cross-modal information in videos. In this\npaper, we propose a multi-level multi-modal hybrid fusion (M2HF) network to\nexplore comprehensive interactions between text queries and each modality\ncontent in videos. Specifically, M2HF first utilizes visual features extracted\nby CLIP to early fuse with audio and motion features extracted from videos,\nobtaining audio-visual fusion features and motion-visual fusion features\nrespectively. Multi-modal alignment problem is also considered in this process.\nThen, visual features, audio-visual fusion features, motion-visual fusion\nfeatures, and texts extracted from videos establish cross-modal relationships\nwith caption queries in a multi-level way.

    "abstract": "Limited scalability and transaction costs are, among others, some of the\ncritical issues that hamper a wider adoption of distributed ledger technologies\n(DLT). That is particularly true for the Ethereum blockchain, which, so far,\nhas been the ecosystem with the highest adoption rate. Quite a few solutions,\nespecially on the Ethereum side of things, have been attempted in the last few\nyears. Most of them adopt the approach to offload transactions from the\nblockchain mainnet, a.k.a. Level 1 (L1), to a separate network. Such systems\nare collectively known as Level 2 (L2) systems. While mitigating the\nscalability issue, the adoption of L2 introduces additional drawbacks: users\nhave to trust that the L2 system has correctly performed transactions or,\nconversely, high computational power is required to prove transactions\ncorrectness. In addition, significant technical knowledge is needed to set up\nand manage such an L2 system. To tackle such limitations, we propose 1DLT: a\nnovel system that enables rapid and trustless deployment of an Ethereum Virtual\nMachine based blockchain that overcomes those drawbacks.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of random assignment of indivisible goods, in which\neach agent has an ordinal preference and a constraint. Our goal is to\ncharacterize the conditions under which there exists a random assignment that\nsimultaneously achieves efficiency and envy-freeness. The probabilistic serial\nmechanism ensures the existence of such an assignment for the unconstrained\nsetting. In this paper, we consider a more general setting in which each agent\ncan consume a set of items only if the set satisfies her feasibility\nconstraint. Such constraints must be taken into account in student course\nplacements, employee shift assignments, and so on. We demonstrate that an\nefficient and envy-free assignment may not exist even for the simple case of\npartition matroid constraints, where the items are categorized and each agent\ndemands one item from each category. We then identify special cases in which an\nefficient and envy-free assignment always exists. For these cases, the\nprobabilistic serial cannot be naturally extended; therefore, we provide\nmechanisms to find the desired assignment using various approaches.",

Indeed, many approaches for verifying neural networks have\nbeen recently proposed, but these generally struggle with limited scalability\nor insufficient accuracy. A key component in many state-of-the-art verification\nschemes is computing lower and upper bounds on the values that neurons in the\nnetwork can obtain for a specific input domain -- and the tighter these bounds,\nthe more likely the verification is to succeed. Many common algorithms for\ncomputing these bounds are variations of the symbolic-bound propagation method;\nand among these, approaches that utilize a process called back-substitution are\nparticularly successful. In this paper, we present an approach for making\nback-substitution produce tighter bounds. To achieve this, we formulate and\nthen minimize the imprecision errors incurred during back-substitution. Our\ntechnique is general, in the sense that it can be integrated into numerous\nexisting symbolic-bound propagation techniques, with only minor modifications.\nWe implement our approach as a proof-of-concept tool, and present favorable\nresults compared to state-of-the-art verifiers that perform back-substitution.",

    "abstract": "Extracting query-document relevance from the sparse, biased clickthrough log\nis among the most fundamental tasks in the web search system. Prior art mainly\nlearns a relevance judgment model with semantic features of the query and\ndocument and ignores directly counterfactual relevance evaluation from the\nclicking log. Though the learned semantic matching models can provide relevance\nsignals for tail queries as long as the semantic feature is available. However,\nsuch a paradigm lacks the capability to introspectively adjust the biased\nrelevance estimation whenever it conflicts with massive implicit user feedback.\nThe counterfactual evaluation methods, on the contrary, ensure unbiased\nrelevance estimation with sufficient click information. However, they suffer\nfrom the sparse or even missing clicks caused by the long-tailed query\ndistribution.\nIn this paper, we propose to unify the counterfactual evaluating and learning\napproaches for unbiased relevance estimation on search queries with various\npopularities. Specifically, we theoretically develop a doubly robust estimator\nwith low bias and variance, which intentionally combines the benefits of\nexisting relevance evaluating and learning approaches.

The prior-art\nfault location methods of the MMC are often developed and verified under full\nload conditions. However, it is revealed that the faulty arm current will be\nsuppressed to be unipolar when the open-circuit fault happens on the submodule\nswitch under light load. This leads to the capacitor voltage of the healthy and\nfaulty submodules rising or falling with the same variations, increasing the\ndifficulty of fault location. The proposed approach of injecting the\nsecond-order circulating current will rebuild the bipolar arm current of the\nMMC and enlarge the capacitor voltage deviations between the healthy and faulty\nSMs. As a result, the fault location time is significantly shortened. The\nsimulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach, showing that the fault location time is reduced to 1/6 compared with\nthe condition without second-order circulating current injection.",

    "abstract": "As a promising privacy-preserving machine learning method, Federated Learning\n(FL) enables global model training across clients without compromising their\nconfidential local data. However, existing FL methods suffer from the problem\nof low inference performance for unevenly distributed data, since most of them\nrely on Federated Averaging (FedAvg)-based aggregation. By averaging model\nparameters in a coarse manner, FedAvg eclipses the individual characteristics\nof local models, which strongly limits the inference capability of FL. Worse\nstill, in each round of FL training, FedAvg dispatches the same initial local\nmodels to clients, which can easily result in stuck-at-local-search for optimal\nglobal models. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel and\neffective FL paradigm named FedMR (Federating Model Recombination). Unlike\nconventional FedAvg-based methods, the cloud server of FedMR shuffles each\nlayer of collected local models and recombines them to achieve new models for\nlocal training on clients. Due to the fine-grained model recombination and\nlocal training in each FL round, FedMR can quickly figure out one globally\noptimal model for all the clients. Comprehensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art FL methods, FedMR can\nsignificantly improve the inference accuracy without causing extra\ncommunication overhead.",

    "title": "QuickSkill: Novice Skill Estimation in Online Multiplayer Games",
    "abstract": "Matchmaking systems are vital for creating fair matches in online multiplayer\ngames, which directly affects players' satisfactions and game experience. Most\nof the matchmaking systems largely rely on precise estimation of players' game\nskills to construct equitable games. However, the skill rating of a novice is\nusually inaccurate, as current matchmaking rating algorithms require\nconsiderable amount of games for learning the true skill of a new player. Using\nthese unreliable skill scores at early stages for matchmaking usually leads to\ndisparities in terms of team performance, which causes negative game\nexperience. This is known as the ''cold-start'' problem for matchmaking rating\nalgorithms.\nTo overcome this conundrum, this paper proposes QuickSKill, a deep learning\nbased novice skill estimation framework to quickly probe abilities of new\nplayers in online multiplayer games. QuickSKill extracts sequential performance\nfeatures from initial few games of a player to predict his/her future skill\nrating with a dedicated neural network, thus delivering accurate skill\nestimation at the player's early game stage. By employing QuickSKill for\nmatchmaking, game fairness can be dramatically improved in the initial\ncold-start period. We conduct experiments in a popular mobile multiplayer game\nin both offline and online scenarios. Results obtained with two real-world\nanonymized gaming datasets demonstrate that proposed QuickSKill delivers\nprecise estimation of game skills for novices, leading to significantly lower\nteam skill disparities and better player game experience. To the best of our\nknowledge, proposed QuickSKill is the first framework that tackles the\ncold-start problem for traditional skill rating algorithms.",

    "title": "Towards Local Underexposed Photo Enhancement",
    "abstract": "Inspired by the ability of deep generative models to generate highly\nrealistic images, much recent work has made progress in enhancing underexposed\nimages globally. However, the local image enhancement approach has not been\nexplored, although they are requisite in the real-world scenario, e.g., fixing\nlocal underexposure. In this work, we define a new task setting for\nunderexposed image enhancement where users are able to control which region to\nbe enlightened with an input mask. As indicated by the mask, an image can be\ndivided into three areas, including Masked Area A, Transition Area B, and\nUnmasked Area C. As a result, Area A should be enlightened to the desired\nlighting, and there shall be a smooth transition (Area B) from the enlightened\narea (Area A) to the unchanged region (Area C). To finish this task, we propose\ntwo methods: Concatenate the mask as additional channels (MConcat), Mask-based\nNormlization (MNorm). While MConcat simply append the mask channels to the\ninput images, MNorm can dynamically enhance the spatial-varying pixels,\nguaranteeing the enhanced images are consistent with the requirement indicated\nby the input mask. Moreover, MConcat serves as a play-and-plug module, and can\nbe incorporated with existing networks, which globally enhance images, to\nachieve the local enhancement. And the overall network can be trained with\nthree kinds of loss functions in Area A, Area B, and Area C, which are unified\nfor various model structures. We perform extensive experiments on public\ndatasets with various parametric approaches for low-light enhancement, %the\nConvolutional-Neutral-Network-based model and Transformer-based model,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of our methods.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is a key technique involved in automatic interpretation\nof high-resolution remote sensing (HRS) imagery and has drawn much attention in\nthe remote sensing community. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have\nbeen successfully applied to the HRS imagery semantic segmentation task due to\ntheir hierarchical representation ability. However, the heavy dependency on a\nlarge number of training data with dense annotation and the sensitiveness to\nthe variation of data distribution severely restrict the potential application\nof DCNNs for the semantic segmentation of HRS imagery. This study proposes a\nnovel unsupervised domain adaptation semantic segmentation network\n(MemoryAdaptNet) for the semantic segmentation of HRS imagery. MemoryAdaptNet\nconstructs an output space adversarial learning scheme to bridge the domain\ndistribution discrepancy between source domain and target domain and to narrow\nthe influence of domain shift. Specifically, we embed an invariant feature\nmemory module to store invariant domain-level context information because the\nfeatures obtained from adversarial learning only tend to represent the variant\nfeature of current limited inputs. This module is integrated by a category\nattention-driven invariant domain-level context aggregation module to current\npseudo invariant feature for further augmenting the pixel representations. An\nentropy-based pseudo label filtering strategy is used to update the memory\nmodule with high-confident pseudo invariant feature of current target images.\nExtensive experiments under three cross-domain tasks indicate that our proposed\nMemoryAdaptNet is remarkably superior to the state-of-the-art methods.",

Our\nwork starts with the observation that Meir and Dinur's fortification lemma for\nprotocol size over rectangles can be generalized to a general fortification\nlemma for a sub-additive measure over set. By applying this lemma to the case\nof cover number, we obtain a dual form of cover number, called\n``$\\delta$-fooling set'' which is a generalized fooling set. Given a\ncommunication problem $S\\subseteq (X\\times Y) \\times Z$, let $\\Lambda \\subseteq\nX\\times Y$ be a $\\delta$-fooling set of $S$, then given any subset\n$\\tilde{\\Lambda} \\subseteq \\Lambda$ such that $|\\tilde{\\Lambda}|/{|\\Lambda|} >\n\\delta$, there is no monochromatic rectangle that covers the subset\n$\\tilde{\\Lambda}$. Particularly, there is a $\\frac{16\\log|X| |Y|}{\\mathsf{\nCov}(S)}$-fooling set of communication problem $S$. With this fact, we are able\nto reprove the classic direct sum theorem of cover number with a simple double\ncounting argument.

    "abstract": "Existing deraining methods mainly focus on a single input image. With just a\nsingle input image, it is extremely difficult to accurately detect rain\nstreaks, remove rain streaks, and restore rain-free images. Compared with a\nsingle 2D image, a light field image (LFI) embeds abundant 3D structure and\ntexture information of the target scene by recording the direction and position\nof each incident ray via a plenoptic camera, which has emerged as a popular\ndevice in the computer vision and graphics research communities. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel network, 4D-MGP-SRRNet, for rain streak removal from an LFI.\nOur method takes as input all sub-views of a rainy LFI. In order to make full\nuse of the LFI, we adopt 4D convolutional layers to build the proposed rain\nsteak removal network to simultaneously process all sub-views of the LFI. In\nthe proposed network, the rain detection model, MGPDNet, with a novel\nMulti-scale Self-guided Gaussian Process (MSGP) module is proposed to detect\nrain streaks from all sub-views of the input LFI. Semi-supervised learning is\nintroduced to accurately detect rain streaks by training on both virtual-world\nrainy LFIs and real-world rainy LFIs at multiple scales via calculating pseudo\nground truth for real-world rain streaks. All sub-views subtracting the\npredicted rain streaks are then fed into a 4D residual model to estimate depth\nmaps. Finally, all sub-views concatenated with the corresponding rain streaks\nand fog maps converted from the estimated depth maps are fed into a rainy LFI\nrestoring model that is based on the adversarial recurrent neural network to\nprogressively eliminate rain streaks and recover the rain-free LFI. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations conducted on both synthetic LFIs and\nreal-world LFIs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

In fact, strategic manipulations\nby rational agents do not be ignored for reaching consensus in distributed\nsystem. In this paper, we extend the game-theoretic analysis of consensus and\ndesign an algorithm of rational uniform consensus with general omission\nfailures under the assumption that processes are controlled by rational agents\nand prefer consensus. Different from crashing one, agent with omission failures\nmay crash, or omit to send or receive messages when it should, which leads to\ndifficulty of detecting faulty agents. By combining the possible failures of\nagents at the both ends of a link, we convert omission failure model into link\nstate model to make faulty detection possible. Through analyzing message\npassing mechanism in the distributed system with n agents, among which t agents\nmay commit omission failures, we provide the upper bound on message passing\ntime for reaching consensus on a state among nonfaulty agents, and message\nchain mechanism for validating messages. And then we prove our rational uniform\nconsensus is a Nash equilibrium when n>2t+1, and failure patterns and initial\npreferences are blind (an assumption of randomness). Thus agents could have no\nmotivation to deviate the consensus. Our research strengthens the reliability\nof consensus with omission failures from the perspective of game theory.",

They usually result in\nlonger delivery times for application data since retransmissions are the de\nfacto technique to recover from such losses. Retransmissions is a good strategy\nfor many applications but it may lead to poor performance with\nlatency-sensitive applications compared to network coding.

    "abstract": "A growing number of universities worldwide use various forms of online and\nblended learning as part of their academic curricula. Furthermore, the recent\nchanges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a drastic increase in\nimportance and ubiquity of online education. Among the major advantages of\ne-learning is not only improving students' learning experience and widening\ntheir educational prospects, but also an opportunity to gain insights into\nstudents' learning processes with learning analytics. This study contributes to\nthe topic of improving and understanding e-learning processes in the following\nways. First, we demonstrate that accurate predictive models can be built based\non sequential patterns derived from students' behavioral data, which are able\nto identify underperforming students early in the course. Second, we\ninvestigate the specificity-generalizability trade-off in building such\npredictive models by investigating whether predictive models should be built\nfor every course individually based on course-specific sequential patterns, or\nacross several courses based on more general behavioral patterns. Finally, we\npresent a methodology for capturing temporal aspects in behavioral data and\nanalyze its influence on the predictive performance of the models. The results\nof our improved sequence classification technique are capable to predict\nstudent performance with high levels of accuracy, reaching 90 percent for\ncourse-specific models.",

DR causes failures in\nnegotiating a reliable division of responsibilities to complete sophisticated\ncooperative tasks. It reflects a flaw in how existing algorithms deal with the\nmultiagent exploration-exploitation dilemma in both value-based and\npolicy-based MARL methods. This DR problem shares similarities with a same-name\nphenomenon in the social psychology domain, also known as the bystander effect.\nIn this work, we start by theoretically analyzing the cause of the DR problem,\nand we emphasize that the DR problem is not relevant to the reward shaping or\nthe credit assignment problems. To deal with the DR problem, we propose a\nPolicy Resonance method to change the multiagent exploration-exploitation\nstrategy and promote the performance of MARL algorithms in difficult MARL\ntasks. This method can be equipped by most existing MARL algorithms to resolve\nthe performance degradation caused by the DR problem.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been successfully applied to\ntransfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to target domains without their\nlabels. Recently introduced transferable prototypical networks (TPN) further\naddresses class-wise conditional alignment. In TPN, while the closeness of\nclass centers between source and target domains is explicitly enforced in a\nlatent space, the underlying fine-grained subtype structure and the\ncross-domain within-class compactness have not been fully investigated. To\ncounter this, we propose a new approach to adaptively perform a fine-grained\nsubtype-aware alignment to improve performance in the target domain without the\nsubtype label in both domains. The insight of our approach is that the\nunlabeled subtypes in a class have the local proximity within a subtype, while\nexhibiting disparate characteristics, because of different conditional and\nlabel shifts. Specifically, we propose to simultaneously enforce subtype-wise\ncompactness and class-wise separation, by utilizing intermediate pseudo-labels.\nIn addition, we systematically investigate various scenarios with and without\nprior knowledge of subtype numbers, and propose to exploit the underlying\nsubtype structure. Furthermore, a dynamic queue framework is developed to\nevolve the subtype cluster centroids steadily using an alternative processing\nscheme. Experimental results, carried out with multi-view congenital heart\ndisease data and VisDA and DomainNet, show the effectiveness and validity of\nour subtype-aware UDA, compared with state-of-the-art UDA methods.",

This\nwork addresses the minimum-time task planning problem for multi-agent systems\nunder complex global tasks stated as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas.\nThese tasks include the temporal and spatial requirements on both independent\nlocal actions and direct sub-team collaborations.

Analyses of its soundness, completeness and\noptimality as the minimal completion time are provided.

Furthermore, to handle fluctuations in task\nduration and agent failures during online execution, an adaptation algorithm is\nproposed to synchronize execution status and re-assign unfinished subtasks\ndynamically to maintain correctness and optimality.

Although recent approaches significantly improved the\nhair details, these models often produce undesirable outputs when a pose of a\nsource image is considerably different from that of a target hair image,\nlimiting their real-world applications. HairFIT, a pose-invariant hairstyle\ntransfer model, alleviates this limitation yet still shows unsatisfactory\nquality in preserving delicate hair textures. To solve these limitations, we\npropose a high-performing pose-invariant hairstyle transfer model equipped with\nlatent optimization and a newly presented local-style-matching loss. In the\nStyleGAN2 latent space, we first explore a pose-aligned latent code of a target\nhair with the detailed textures preserved based on local style matching. Then,\nour model inpaints the occlusions of the source considering the aligned target\nhair and blends both images to produce a final output.

Data-driven methods such as\nDynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) can extract coherent structures from\nspatio-temporal data generated from dynamical systems and infer different\nscenarios for said systems. The spatio-temporal data comes as snapshots\ncontaining spatial information for each time instant. In modern engineering\napplications, the generation of high-dimensional snapshots can be time and/or\nresource-demanding. In the present study, we consider two strategies for\nenhancing DMD workflow in large numerical simulations: (i) snapshots\ncompression to relieve disk pressure; (ii) the use of in situ visualization\nimages to reconstruct the dynamics (or part of) in runtime. We evaluate our\napproaches with two 3D fluid dynamics simulations and consider DMD to\nreconstruct the solutions. Results reveal that snapshot compression\nconsiderably reduces the required disk space. We have observed that lossy\ncompression reduces storage by almost $50\\%$ with low relative errors in the\nsignal reconstructions and other quantities of interest. We also extend our\nanalysis to data generated on-the-fly, using in-situ visualization tools to\ngenerate image files of our state vectors during runtime. On large simulations,\nthe generation of snapshots may be slow enough to use batch algorithms for\ninference. Streaming DMD takes advantage of the incremental SVD algorithm and\nupdates the modes with the arrival of each new snapshot. We use streaming DMD\nto reconstruct the dynamics from in-situ generated images. We show that this\nprocess is efficient, and the reconstructed dynamics are accurate.",

Diverse\nreal-world systems can be abstracted as complex networks each consisting of\nmany functional nodes and edges. Percolation theory has indicated that removing\nonly a few vital nodes can cause the collapse of whole network. However,\nfinding the least number of such vital nodes is a rather challenging task for\nlarge networks due to its NP-hardness. Previous studies have proposed many\ncentrality measures and heuristic algorithms to tackle this network dismantling\n(ND) problem. Different from theirs, this article tries to approach the ND task\nby designing a neural model which can be trained from tiny synthetic networks\nbut will be applied for various real-world networks. It seems a discouraging\nmission at first sight, as network sizes and topologies are quite different\nacross distinct real-world networks. Nonetheless, this article initiates\ninsightful efforts of designing and training a neural influence ranking model\n(NIRM). Experiments on fifteen real-world networks validate its effectiveness\nfor its mostly requiring fewer vital nodes to dismantle a network, compared\nwith the state-of-the-art competitors. The key to its success lies in that our\nNIRM can efficiently encode both local structural and global topological\nsignals for ranking nodes, in addition to our innovative labelling method in\ntraining dataset construction.",

In spite of its theoretical promise for linear regression,\nthe challenges of using IRM in linear classification problems yet remain\n(Rosenfeld et al.,2020, Nagarajan et al., 2021). Along this line, a recent\nstudy (Arjovsky et al., 2019) has made a first step and proposes a learning\nprinciple of information bottleneck based invariant risk minimization (IB-IRM).\nIn this paper, we first show that the key assumption of support overlap of\ninvariant features used in (Arjovsky et al., 2019) is rather strong for the\nguarantee of OOD generalization and it is still possible to achieve the optimal\nsolution without such assumption. To further answer the question of whether\nIB-IRM is sufficient for learning invariant features in linear classification\nproblems, we show that IB-IRM would still fail in two cases whether or not the\ninvariant features capture all information about the label. To address such\nfailures, we propose a \\textit{Counterfactual Supervision-based Information\nBottleneck (CSIB)} learning algorithm that provably recovers the invariant\nfeatures.

    "title": "New Parallel Order Maintenance Data Structure",
    "abstract": "The \\emph{Order-Maintenance} (OM) data structure maintains a total order list\nof items for insertions, deletions, and comparisons. As a basic data structure,\nOM has many applications, such as maintaining the topological order, core\nnumbers, and truss in graphs, and maintaining ordered sets in Unified Modeling\nLanguage (UML) Specification. The prevalence of multicore machines suggests\nparallelizing such a basic data structure. This paper proposes a new parallel\nOM data structure that supports insertions, deletions, and comparisons in\nparallel. Specifically, parallel insertions and deletions are synchronized by\nusing locks efficiently, which achieve up to $7$x and $5.6$x speedups with $64$\nworkers. One big advantage is that the comparisons are lock-free so that they\ncan execute highly in parallel with other insertions and deletions, which\nachieve up to $34.4$x speedups with $64$ workers. Typical real applications\nmaintain order lists that always have a much larger portion of comparisons than\ninsertions and deletions. For example, in core maintenance, the number of\ncomparisons is up to 297 times larger compared with insertions and deletions in\ncertain graphs. This is why the lock-free order comparison is a breakthrough in\npractice.",

We discuss how approximate\nE-step can be interpreted as performing variational inference. Important\nconcepts such as amortization and the reparametrization trick are discussed in\ngreat detail. Finally, we derive from scratch the AEVB training procedures of a\nnon-deep and several deep latent variable models, including VAE, Conditional\nVAE, Gaussian Mixture VAE and Variational RNN. It is our hope that readers\nwould recognize AEVB as a general algorithm that can be used to fit a wide\nrange of latent variable models (not just VAE), and apply AEVB to such models\nthat arise in their own fields of research.

A deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm is explored to\nobtain the satisfactory solution by repeatedly interacting with and learning\nfrom the dynamic environment. Extensive simulation results illustrate that the\nDRL-based secure beamforming algorithm is proved to be significantly effective\nin improving the SSR.

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks consist of randomly distributed sensor nodes for\nmonitoring targets or areas of interest. Maintaining the network for continuous\nsurveillance is a challenge due to the limited battery capacity in each sensor.\nWireless power transfer technology is emerging as a reliable solution for\nenergizing the sensors by deploying a mobile charger (MC) to recharge the\nsensor. However, designing an optimal charging path for the MC is challenging\nbecause of uncertainties arising in the networks. The energy consumption rate\nof the sensors may fluctuate significantly due to unpredictable changes in the\nnetwork topology, such as node failures. These changes also lead to shifts in\nthe importance of each sensor, which are often assumed to be the same in\nexisting works. We address these challenges in this paper by proposing a novel\nadaptive charging scheme using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach.\nSpecifically, we endow the MC with a charging policy that determines the next\nsensor to charge conditioning on the current state of the network. We then use\na deep neural network to parametrize this charging policy, which will be\ntrained by reinforcement learning techniques. Our model can adapt to\nspontaneous changes in the network topology. The empirical results show that\nthe proposed algorithm outperforms the existing on-demand algorithms by a\nsignificant margin.",

    "abstract": "Emulating firmware of microcontrollers is challenging due to the lack of\nperipheral models. Existing work finds out how to respond to peripheral read\noperations by analyzing the target firmware. This is problematic because the\nfirmware sometimes does not contain enough clues to support the emulation or\neven contains misleading information (e.g. buggy firmware). In this work, we\npropose a new approach that builds peripheral models from the peripheral\nspecification. Using NLP, we translate peripheral behaviors in human language\n(documented in chip manuals) into a set of structured condition-action rules.\nBy checking, executing, and chaining them at runtime, we can dynamically\nsynthesize a peripheral model for each firmware execution. The extracted\ncondition-action rules might not be complete or even be wrong. We, therefore,\npropose incorporating symbolic execution to quickly pinpoint the root cause.\nThis assists us in the manual correction of the problematic rules. We have\nimplemented our idea for five popular MCU boards spanning three different chip\nvendors. Using a new edit-distance-based algorithm to calculate trace\ndifferences, our evaluation against a large firmware corpus confirmed that our\nprototype achieves much higher fidelity compared with state-of-the-art\nsolutions. Benefiting from the accurate emulation, our emulator effectively\navoids false positives observed in existing fuzzing work.

This study develops a Parallel Hierarchical\nTransformer (PHT) with attention alignment for MDS. By incorporating word- and\nparagraph-level multi-head attentions, the hierarchical architecture of PHT\nallows better processing of dependencies at both token and document levels. To\nguide the decoding towards a better coverage of the source documents, the\nattention-alignment mechanism is then introduced to calibrate beam search with\npredicted optimal attention distributions. Based on the WikiSum data, a\ncomprehensive evaluation is conducted to test improvements on MDS by the\nproposed architecture. By better handling the inner- and cross-document\ninformation, results in both ROUGE and human evaluation suggest that our\nhierarchical model generates summaries of higher quality relative to other\nTransformer-based baselines at relatively low computational cost.",

To alleviate this problem, we present TexPrax, a messaging\nsystem to collect and annotate problems, causes, and solutions that occur in\nwork-related chats. TexPrax uses a chatbot to directly engage the employees to\nprovide lightweight annotations on their conversation and ease their\ndocumentation work. To comply with data privacy and security regulations, we\nuse an end-to-end message encryption and give our users full control over their\ndata which has various advantages over conventional annotation tools. We\nevaluate TexPrax in a user-study with German factory employees who ask their\ncolleagues for solutions on problems that arise during their daily work.\nOverall, we collect 201 task-oriented German dialogues containing 1,027\nsentences with sentence-level expert annotations.

    "abstract": "Realistic generative face video synthesis has long been a pursuit in both\ncomputer vision and graphics community. However, existing face video generation\nmethods tend to produce low-quality frames with drifted facial identities and\nunnatural movements. To tackle these challenges, we propose a principled\nframework named StyleFaceV, which produces high-fidelity identity-preserving\nface videos with vivid movements. Our core insight is to decompose appearance\nand pose information and recompose them in the latent space of StyleGAN3 to\nproduce stable and dynamic results. Specifically, StyleGAN3 provides strong\npriors for high-fidelity facial image generation, but the latent space is\nintrinsically entangled. By carefully examining its latent properties, we\npropose our decomposition and recomposition designs which allow for the\ndisentangled combination of facial appearance and movements. Moreover, a\ntemporal-dependent model is built upon the decomposed latent features, and\nsamples reasonable sequences of motions that are capable of generating\nrealistic and temporally coherent face videos. Particularly, our pipeline is\ntrained with a joint training strategy on both static images and high-quality\nvideo data, which is of higher data efficiency. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art face video generation\nresults both qualitatively and quantitatively.

    "abstract": "The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) allows prediction of chemically\naccurate total energies via variational minimization on a quantum device. The\nsevere scaling of high-fidelity quantum chemical methods can be overcome due to\nqubit entanglement and an exponentially large computational space, potentially\nallowing for modeling of the electronic structure for larger systems to an\naccuracy of 1kcal/mol or better. Nevertheless, current VQE implementations on\nexisting quantum hardware are limited by qubit error rates, the number of\nqubits available, and the allowable gate depth. The largest chemical systems\nmodeled to date using VQE include s and p block elements. Here we study the\nscaling of VQE on a quantum emulator to study the near-term feasibility of\nmodeling a molecule containing d orbitals, specifically the TiH diatomic\nmolecule, in order to better understand the hardware necessary to carry out\nthis calculation on a real device. We model LiH, NaH, KH, and TiH diatomic\nmolecules to demonstrate that the inclusion of d-orbitals and the UCCSD ansatz\ndramatically increase the cost of this problem. We show that a parallel\nimplementation of VQE along with optimal choice of quantum circuit measurement\nbasis set enable the study of larger systems on a classical emulator, but only\nprovide approximately polynomial savings in the face of exponential growth in\nclassical computational resources. The approximate error rates necessary to\nperform this calculation on trapped ion hardware are estimated and shown to\nlikely prohibit the practical study of TiH on current devices using the UCCSD\nansatz until significant improvements in both hardware and algorithms are\navailable. The successful treatment of moderate-sized, d-electron molecules,\nsuch as TiH, using the VQE algorithm therefore stands as an important waypoint\nin the advancement of useful chemical applications of near-term quantum\nprocessors.",

Existing deep learning-based multi-scale fusion\narchitectures have demonstrated a tremendous capacity for 2D medical image\nsegmentation. The key to their success is aggregating global context and\nmaintaining high resolution representations. However, when translated into 3D\nsegmentation problems, existing multi-scale fusion architectures might\nunderperform due to their heavy computation overhead and substantial data diet.\nTo address this issue, we propose a new OAR segmentation framework, called\nOARFocalFuseNet, which fuses multi-scale features and employs focal modulation\nfor capturing global-local context across multiple scales.

It is well known that the presence of\nbottlenecks in a graph hampers mixing and, in particular, starting inside a\nsmall bottleneck significantly slows down the diffusion of the walk in the\nfirst steps of the process. To circumvent this problem, the average mixing time\nis defined to be the mixing time starting at a uniformly random vertex.\nIn this paper we provide a general framework to show logarithmic average\nmixing time for random walks on graphs with small bottlenecks. The framework is\nespecially effective on certain families of random graphs with heterogeneous\nproperties. We demonstrate its applicability on two random models for which the\nmixing time was known to be of order $\\log^2n$, speeding up the mixing to order\n$\\log n$. First, in the context of smoothed analysis on connected graphs, we\nshow logarithmic average mixing time for randomly perturbed graphs of bounded\ndegeneracy. A particular instance is the Newman-Watts small-world model.\nSecond, we show logarithmic average mixing time for supercritically percolated\nexpander graphs.

Two main approaches for\nsolving matrix sensing are based on semidefinite programming (SDP) and\nBurer-Monteiro (B-M) factorization. The SDP method suffers from high\ncomputational and space complexities, whereas the B-M method may return a\nspurious solution due to the non-convexity of the problem. The existing\ntheoretical guarantees for the success of these methods have led to similar\nconservative conditions, which may wrongly imply that these methods have\ncomparable performances. In this paper, we shed light on some major differences\nbetween these two methods. First, we present a class of structured matrix\ncompletion problems for which the B-M methods fail with an overwhelming\nprobability, while the SDP method works correctly. Second, we identify a class\nof highly sparse matrix completion problems for which the B-M method works and\nthe SDP method fails. Third, we prove that although the B-M method exhibits the\nsame performance independent of the rank of the unknown solution, the success\nof the SDP method is correlated to the rank of the solution and improves as the\nrank increases.

    "title": "Coil2Coil: Self-supervised MR image denoising using phased-array coil  images",
    "abstract": "Denoising of magnetic resonance images is beneficial in improving the quality\nof low signal-to-noise ratio images. Recently, denoising using deep neural\nnetworks has demonstrated promising results. Most of these networks, however,\nutilize supervised learning, which requires large training images of\nnoise-corrupted and clean image pairs. Obtaining training images, particularly\nclean images, is expensive and time-consuming. Hence, methods such as\nNoise2Noise (N2N) that require only pairs of noise-corrupted images have been\ndeveloped to reduce the burden of obtaining training datasets. In this study,\nwe propose a new self-supervised denoising method, Coil2Coil (C2C), that does\nnot require the acquisition of clean images or paired noise-corrupted images\nfor training. Instead, the method utilizes multichannel data from phased-array\ncoils to generate training images. First, it divides and combines multichannel\ncoil images into two images, one for input and the other for label. Then, they\nare processed to impose noise independence and sensitivity normalization such\nthat they can be used for the training images of N2N. For inference, the method\ninputs a coil-combined image (e.g., DICOM image), enabling a wide application\nof the method. When evaluated using synthetic noise-added images, C2C shows the\nbest performance against several self-supervised methods, reporting comparable\noutcomes to supervised methods. When testing the DICOM images, C2C successfully\ndenoised real noise without showing structure-dependent residuals in the error\nmaps. Because of the significant advantage of not requiring additional scans\nfor clean or paired images, the method can be easily utilized for various\nclinical applications.",

    "title": "A unifying partially-interpretable framework for neural network-based  extreme quantile regression",
    "abstract": "Risk management in many environmental settings requires an understanding of\nthe mechanisms that drive extreme events. Useful metrics for quantifying such\nrisk are extreme quantiles of response variables conditioned on predictor\nvariables that describe e.g., climate, biosphere and environmental states.\nTypically these quantiles lie outside the range of observable data and so, for\nestimation, require specification of parametric extreme value models within a\nregression framework. Classical approaches in this context utilise linear or\nadditive relationships between predictor and response variables and suffer in\neither their predictive capabilities or computational efficiency; moreover,\ntheir simplicity is unlikely to capture the truly complex structures that lead\nto the creation of extreme wildfires. In this paper, we propose a new\nmethodological framework for performing extreme quantile regression using\nartificial neutral networks, which are able to capture complex non-linear\nrelationships and scale well to high-dimensional data. The \"black box\" nature\nof neural networks means that they lack the desirable trait of interpretability\noften favoured by practitioners; thus, we combine aspects of linear, and\nadditive, models with deep learning to create partially interpretable neural\nnetworks that can be used for statistical inference but retain high prediction\naccuracy. To complement this methodology, we further propose a novel point\nprocess model for extreme values which overcomes the finite lower-endpoint\nproblem associated with the generalised extreme value class of distributions.\nEfficacy of our unified framework is illustrated on U.S. wildfire data with a\nhigh-dimensional predictor set and we illustrate vast improvements in\npredictive performance over linear and spline-based regression techniques.",

To obtain an\nimportance sampling estimate of the marginal likelihood, AIS introduces an\nextended target distribution to reweight the Markov chain proposal. While much\neffort has been devoted to improving the proposal distribution used by AIS, by\nchanging the intermediate distributions and corresponding Markov kernels, an\nunderappreciated issue is that AIS uses a convenient but suboptimal extended\ntarget distribution.

    "abstract": "Many recent machine learning tasks resort to quantum computing to improve\nclassification accuracy and training efficiency by taking advantage of quantum\nmechanics, known as quantum machine learning (QML). The variational quantum\ncircuit (VQC) is frequently utilized to build a quantum neural network (QNN),\nwhich is a counterpart to the conventional neural network. Due to hardware\nlimitations, however, current quantum devices only allow one to use few qubits\nto represent data and perform simple quantum computations. The limited quantum\nresource on a single quantum device degrades the data usage and limits the\nscale of the quantum circuits, preventing quantum advantage to some extent. To\nalleviate this constraint, we propose an approach to implementing a scalable\nquantum neural network (SQNN) by utilizing the quantum resource of multiple\nsmall-size quantum devices cooperatively. In an SQNN system, several quantum\ndevices are used as quantum feature extractors, extracting local features from\nan input instance in parallel, and a quantum device works as a quantum\npredictor, performing prediction over the local features collected through\nclassical communication channels. The quantum feature extractors in the SQNN\nsystem are independent of each other, so one can flexibly use quantum devices\nof varying sizes, with larger quantum devices extracting more local features.\nEspecially, the SQNN can be performed on a single quantum device in a modular\nfashion. Our work is exploratory and carried out on a quantum system simulator\nusing the TensorFlow Quantum library. The evaluation conducts a binary\nclassification on the MNIST dataset.

In this technique, unpooling and\ndeconvolution is done to generate the input data to minimize the difference\nbetween input and output data. Moreover, it extracts characteristic features\nfrom the input data set to regenerate input data from those features by\nlearning a network to reduce overfitting. Results: Different accuracy and\nprocessing time value is achieved while using different sample image group of\nConfocal Laser Endomicroscopy (CLE) images. The results showed that the\nproposed solution is better than the current system. Moreover, the proposed\nsystem has improved the classification accuracy by 5~ 5.5% on average and\nreduced the average processing time by 20 ~ 30 milliseconds. Conclusion: The\nproposed system focuses on the accurate classification of oral cancer cells of\ndifferent anatomical locations from the CLE images. Finally, this study\nenhances the accuracy and processing time using the autoencoder method that\nsolves the overfitting problem.",
