    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven successful in a wide variety of\napplications such as speech recognition and synthesis, computer vision, machine\ntranslation, and game playing, to name but a few. However, existing deep neural\nnetwork models are computationally expensive and memory intensive, hindering\ntheir deployment in devices with low memory resources or in applications with\nstrict latency requirements. Therefore, a natural thought is to perform model\ncompression and acceleration in deep networks without significantly decreasing\nthe model performance, which is what we call reducing the complexity. In the\nfollowing work, we try reducing the complexity of state of the art LSTM models\nfor natural language tasks such as text classification, by distilling their\nknowledge to CNN based models, thus reducing the inference time(or latency)\nduring testing.",

    "abstract": "Currently, deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely adopted in different\napplications. Despite its commercial values, training a well-performed DNN is\nresource-consuming. Accordingly, the well-trained model is valuable\nintellectual property for its owner. However, recent studies revealed the\nthreats of model stealing, where the adversaries can obtain a function-similar\ncopy of the victim model, even when they can only query the model. In this\npaper, we propose an effective and harmless model ownership verification (MOVE)\nto defend against different types of model stealing simultaneously, without\nintroducing new security risks. In general, we conduct the ownership\nverification by verifying whether a suspicious model contains the knowledge of\ndefender-specified external features. Specifically, we embed the external\nfeatures by tempering a few training samples with style transfer. We then train\na meta-classifier to determine whether a model is stolen from the victim. This\napproach is inspired by the understanding that the stolen models should contain\nthe knowledge of features learned by the victim model. In particular, we\ndevelop our MOVE method under both white-box and black-box settings to provide\ncomprehensive model protection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\nverify the effectiveness of our method and its resistance to potential adaptive\nattacks. The codes for reproducing the main experiments of our method are\navailable at \\url{https://github.com/THUYimingLi/MOVE}.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel decision-making framework for autonomous vehicles\n(AVs), called predictor-corrector potential game (PCPG), composed of a\nPredictor and a Corrector. To enable human-like reasoning and characterize\nagent interactions, a receding-horizon multi-player game is formulated. To\naddress the challenges caused by the complexity in solving a multi-player game\nand by the requirement of real-time operation, a potential game (PG) based\ndecision-making framework is developed. In the PG Predictor, the agent cost\nfunctions are heuristically predefined. We acknowledge that the behaviors of\nother traffic agents, e.g., human-driven vehicles and pedestrians, may not\nnecessarily be consistent with the predefined cost functions. To address this\nissue, a best response-based PG Corrector is designed. In the Corrector, the\naction deviation between the ego vehicle prediction and the surrounding agent\nactual behaviors are measured and are fed back to the ego vehicle\ndecision-making, to correct the prediction errors caused by the inaccurate\npredefined cost functions and to improve the ego vehicle strategies.\nDistinguished from most existing game-theoretic approaches, this PCPG 1)\ndeals with multi-player games and guarantees the existence of a pure-strategy\nNash equilibrium (PSNE), convergence of the PSNE seeking algorithm, and global\noptimality of the derived PSNE when multiple PSNE exist; 2) is computationally\nscalable in a multi-agent scenario; 3) guarantees the ego vehicle safety under\ncertain conditions; and 4) approximates the actual PSNE of the system despite\nthe unknown cost functions of others. Comparative studies between the PG, the\nPCPG, and the control barrier function (CBF) based approaches are conducted in\ndiverse traffic scenarios, including oncoming traffic scenario and\nmulti-vehicle intersection-crossing scenario.",

    "abstract": "Sharing experimental data and making data findable, accessible,\ninteroperable, and reusable (FAIR) are of growing importance to funders,\npublishers, and to scientists themselves. Evaluating whether datasets are FAIR\nis challenging because the FAIR Guiding Principles include highly idiosyncratic\ncriteria regarding the metadata used to annotate datasets -- such as whether\nmetadata are \"rich\" and whether they adhere to \"domain-relevant\" community\nstandards. Rather than attempting to assess whether the metadata comport with\nthe FAIR principles after datasets are already archived in some repository, an\nalternative approach is to enable scientific communities to define their own\ntemplates for metadata that necessarily encode these discipline-specific\nelements. Such templates, inherently, incorporate the level of \"richness\"\ndesired by the community and the standards (both reporting guidelines and\nontologies) that the community wishes to adopt. We have explored this approach\nin the context of two software systems that use such metadata templates. One is\nthe CEDAR Workbench, which is used to author both metadata templates and new\nmetadata. The other is the FAIRware Workbench, which evaluates the metadata of\narchived datasets for their adherence to community standards. There are\nbenefits when templates for metadata are made to be central elements of an\necosystem of tools to manage online datasets -- both because they serve as an\nexaminable community reference for what constitutes FAIR data, and because they\nembody that perspective in a machine-actionable format that can be distributed\namong a variety of software applications to assist with data stewardship and\ndata sharing.",

Thus, it is unclear if an AI system's inputs will be\nindependent of its outputs, and, therefore, if AI systems can be treated as\ntraditional components.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViT) are competing to replace Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNN) for various computer vision tasks in medical imaging such as\nclassification and segmentation. While the vulnerability of CNNs to adversarial\nattacks is a well-known problem, recent works have shown that ViTs are also\nsusceptible to such attacks and suffer significant performance degradation\nunder attack. The vulnerability of ViTs to carefully engineered adversarial\nsamples raises serious concerns about their safety in clinical settings. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel self-ensembling method to enhance the robustness\nof ViT in the presence of adversarial attacks. The proposed Self-Ensembling\nVision Transformer (SEViT) leverages the fact that feature representations\nlearned by initial blocks of a ViT are relatively unaffected by adversarial\nperturbations. Learning multiple classifiers based on these intermediate\nfeature representations and combining these predictions with that of the final\nViT classifier can provide robustness against adversarial attacks. Measuring\nthe consistency between the various predictions can also help detect\nadversarial samples. Experiments on two modalities (chest X-ray and fundoscopy)\ndemonstrate the efficacy of SEViT architecture to defend against various\nadversarial attacks in the gray-box (attacker has full knowledge of the target\nmodel, but not the defense mechanism) setting.

In most of the current\nliterature, FL has been studied for supervised ML tasks, in which edge devices\ncollect labeled data. Nevertheless, in many applications, it is impractical to\nassume existence of labeled data across devices. To this end, we develop a\nnovel methodology, Cooperative Federated unsupervised Contrastive Learning\n(CF-CL), for FL across edge devices with unlabeled datasets. CF-CL employs\nlocal device cooperation where data are exchanged among devices through\ndevice-to-device (D2D) communications to avoid local model bias resulting from\nnon-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) local datasets. CF-CL\nintroduces a push-pull smart data sharing mechanism tailored to unsupervised FL\nsettings, in which, each device pushes a subset of its local datapoints to its\nneighbors as reserved data points, and pulls a set of datapoints from its\nneighbors, sampled through a probabilistic importance sampling technique. We\ndemonstrate that CF-CL leads to (i) alignment of unsupervised learned latent\nspaces across devices, (ii) faster global convergence, allowing for less\nfrequent global model aggregations; and (iii) is effective in extreme\nnon-i.i.d. data settings across the devices.",

To\nprotect end users from being harmed and hide transactions from the mempool,\nprivate transactions, a special type of transactions that are sent directly to\nminers, were invented. Private transactions have a high probability of being\npacked to the front positions of a block and being added to the blockchain by\nthe target miner, without going through the public mempool, thus reducing the\nrisk of being attacked by malicious entities.\nDespite the good intention of inventing private transactions, due to their\nstealthy nature, private transactions have also been used by attackers to\nlaunch attacks, which has a negative impact on the Ethereum ecosystem. However,\nexisting works only touch upon private transactions as by-products when\nstudying MEV, while a systematic study on private transactions is still\nmissing. To fill this gap and paint a complete picture of private transactions,\nwe take the first step towards investigating the private transactions on\nEthereum. In particular, we collect large-scale private transaction datasets\nand perform analysis on their characteristics, transaction costs and miner\nprofits, as well as security impacts.

In addition, stochastic noises fed to the\ngenerator are employed for unconditional detail generation, which tends to\nproduce unfaithful details that compromise the fidelity of the generated SR\nimage. We design LAREN, a LAtent multi-Relation rEasoNing technique that\nachieves superb large-factor SR through graph-based multi-relation reasoning in\nlatent space. LAREN consists of two innovative designs. The first is\ngraph-based disentanglement that constructs a superior disentangled latent\nspace via hierarchical multi-relation reasoning. The second is graph-based code\ngeneration that produces image-specific codes progressively via recursive\nrelation reasoning which enables prior GANs to generate desirable image\ndetails.

This problem is exacerbated for advanced technology\nnodes, where transistor dimensions reach atomic levels and established margins\nare severely constrained. Hence, traditional worst-case analysis becomes\nimpractical, resulting in intolerable performance overheads. Contrarily,\nprocess-variation/aging-aware static timing analysis (STA) equips designers\nwith accurate statistical delay distributions. Timing guardbands that are\nsmall, yet sufficient, can then be effectively estimated. However, such\nanalysis is costly as it requires intensive Monte-Carlo simulations. Further,\nit necessitates access to confidential physics-based aging models to generate\nthe standard-cell libraries required for STA.\nIn this work, we employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to accurately estimate\nthe impact of process variations and device aging on the delay of any path\nwithin a circuit. Our proposed GNN4REL framework empowers designers to perform\nrapid and accurate reliability estimations without accessing transistor models,\nstandard-cell libraries, or even STA; these components are all incorporated\ninto the GNN model via training by the foundry. Specifically, GNN4REL is\ntrained on a FinFET technology model that is calibrated against industrial 14nm\nmeasurement data. Through our extensive experiments on EPFL and ITC-99\nbenchmarks, as well as RISC-V processors, we successfully estimate delay\ndegradations of all paths -- notably within seconds -- with a mean absolute\nerror down to 0.01 percentage points.",

    "abstract": "Probability calibration for deep models is highly desirable in\nsafety-critical applications such as medical imaging. It makes output\nprobabilities of deep networks interpretable, by aligning prediction\nprobabilities with the actual accuracy in test data. In image segmentation,\nwell-calibrated probabilities allow radiologists to identify regions where\nmodel-predicted segmentations are unreliable. These unreliable predictions\noften occur to out-of-domain (OOD) images that are caused by imaging artifacts\nor unseen imaging protocols. Unfortunately, most previous calibration methods\nfor image segmentation perform sub-optimally on OOD images. To reduce the\ncalibration error when confronted with OOD images, we propose a novel post-hoc\ncalibration model. Our model leverages the pixel susceptibility against\nperturbations at the local level, and the shape prior information at the global\nlevel. The model is tested on cardiac MRI segmentation datasets that contain\nunseen imaging artifacts and images from an unseen imaging protocol. We\ndemonstrate reduced calibration errors compared with the state-of-the-art\ncalibration algorithm.",

Given valid\ncounterfactuals, humans are capable of reasoning under ``what-if''\ncircumstances, so as to better understand the model decision boundaries.\nHowever, releasing counterfactuals could be detrimental, since it may\nunintentionally leak sensitive information to adversaries, which brings about\nhigher risks on both model security and data privacy. To bridge the gap, in\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework to generate differentially private\ncounterfactual (DPC) without touching the deployed model or explanation set,\nwhere noises are injected for protection while maintaining the explanation\nroles of counterfactual. In particular, we train an autoencoder with the\nfunctional mechanism to construct noisy class prototypes, and then derive the\nDPC from the latent prototypes based on the post-processing immunity of\ndifferential privacy. Further evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed framework, showing that DPC can successfully relieve the risks on both\nextraction and inference attacks.",

    "abstract": "Data recovery has long been a focus of the electronics industry for decades\nby security experts, focusing on hard disk recovery, a type of non-volatile\nmemory. Unfortunately, none of the existing research, neither from academia,\nindustry, or government, have ever considered data recovery from volatile\nmemories. The data is lost when it is powered off, by definition. To the best\nof our knowledge, we are the first to present an approach to recovering data\nfrom a static random access memory. It is conventional wisdom that SRAM loses\nits contents whenever it turns off, and it is not required to protect sensitive\ninformation, e.g., the firmware code, secret encryption keys, etc., when an\nSRAM-based computing system retires. Unfortunately, the recycling of integrated\ncircuits poses a severe threat to the protection of intellectual properties. In\nthis paper, we present a novel concept to retrieve SRAM data as aging leads to\na power-up state with an imprint of the stored values. We show that our\nproposed approaches can partially recover the previously used SRAM content. The\naccuracy of the recovered data can be further increased by incorporating\nmultiple SRAM chips compared to a single one. It is impossible to retrieve the\nprior content of some stable SRAM cells, where aging shifts these cells towards\nstability. As the locations of these cells vary from chip to chip due to\nuncontrollable process variation, the same cell has a higher chance of being\nunstable or stable against aging in any of the chips, which helps us recover\nthe content. Finally, majority voting is used to combine a set of SRAM chips'\ndata to recover the stored data. We present our experimental result using\ncommercial off-the-shelf SRAMs with stored binary image data before performing\naccelerated aging. We demonstrate the successful partial retrieval on SRAMs\nthat are aged with as little as 4 hours of accelerated aging with 85C.",

To quantify this notion, we calculate the expected number\nof individuals, the \"audience\", who find out about a particular interaction.\nFor a potential donor, a larger audience constitutes higher reputational\nstakes, and thus a higher incentive, to perform \"good\" actions in line with\ncurrent social norms. For a receiver, a larger audience therefore increases the\ntrust that the partner will be cooperative. This idea can be used for an\nalgorithm that generates social networks, which we call trust based attachment\n(TBA).

To tackle it, many previous works have\nused multi-scale architecture in deep neural networks (DNNs). Multi-scale\nbranches can be either directly merged (e.g. by concatenation) or merged\nthrough the guidance of proxies (e.g. attentions) in the DNNs. Despite their\nprevalence, these combination methods are not sophisticated enough to deal with\nthe per-pixel performance discrepancy over multi-scale density maps. In this\nwork, we redesign the multi-scale neural network by introducing a hierarchical\nmixture of density experts, which hierarchically merges multi-scale density\nmaps for crowd counting. Within the hierarchical structure, an expert\ncompetition and collaboration scheme is presented to encourage contributions\nfrom all scales; pixel-wise soft gating nets are introduced to provide\npixel-wise soft weights for scale combinations in different hierarchies.

    "title": "Quantifying the Sensitivity and Unclonability of Optical Physical  Unclonable Functions",
    "abstract": "Due to their unmatched entropy, complexity, and security level, optical\nPhysical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) currently receive a lot of interest in the\nliterature. Despite the large body of existing works, however, one of their\ncore features has never been quantified in detail, namely their physical\nunclonability. This paper tackles this fundamental and yet largely unaddressed\nissue. In simulations and/or experiments, the sensitivity of diffraction-based\noptical responses is investigated with respect to various small alterations\nsuch as variation in the position, size, and number of the scatterers, as well\nas perturbations in the spatial alignment between the physical unclonable\nfunction (PUF) and the measurement apparatus. Our analysis focuses on 2D\noptical PUFs because of their relevance in integrated applications and the need\nto reply to security concerns that can be raised when the physical structure of\nthe geometry is accessible. Among the results of this study, the sensitivity\nanalysis shows that a positional perturbation of scatterers on the order of\n\\SI{30}{\\nano\\meter}, i.e., far below the wavelength of the probing laser light\nof \\SI{632}{\\nano\\meter} wavelength, is sufficient to invalidate the PUF\nresponse and thus detect a forgery attempt. These results support and quantify\nthe high adversarial efforts required to clone optical PUFs, even for 2D\nlayouts.",

One of the most widely-used approaches for tackling imbalanced data is\nre-weighting, where training samples are associated with different weights in\nthe loss function. Most of existing re-weighting approaches treat the example\nweights as the learnable parameter and optimize the weights on the meta set,\nentailing expensive bilevel optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel\nre-weighting method based on optimal transport (OT) from a distributional point\nof view. Specifically, we view the training set as an imbalanced distribution\nover its samples, which is transported by OT to a balanced distribution\nobtained from the meta set. The weights of the training samples are the\nprobability mass of the imbalanced distribution and learned by minimizing the\nOT distance between the two distributions. Compared with existing methods, our\nproposed one disengages the dependence of the weight learning on the concerned\nclassifier at each iteration. Experiments on image, text and point cloud\ndatasets demonstrate that our proposed re-weighting method has excellent\nperformance, achieving state-of-the-art results in many cases and providing a\npromising tool for addressing the imbalanced classification issue.",

    "title": "A Novel Enhanced Convolution Neural Network with Extreme Learning  Machine: Facial Emotional Recognition in Psychology Practices",
    "abstract": "Facial emotional recognition is one of the essential tools used by\nrecognition psychology to diagnose patients. Face and facial emotional\nrecognition are areas where machine learning is excelling. Facial Emotion\nRecognition in an unconstrained environment is an open challenge for digital\nimage processing due to different environments, such as lighting conditions,\npose variation, yaw motion, and occlusions. Deep learning approaches have shown\nsignificant improvements in image recognition. However, accuracy and time still\nneed improvements. This research aims to improve facial emotion recognition\naccuracy during the training session and reduce processing time using a\nmodified Convolution Neural Network Enhanced with Extreme Learning Machine\n(CNNEELM). The system entails (CNNEELM) improving the accuracy in image\nregistration during the training session. Furthermore, the system recognizes\nsix facial emotions happy, sad, disgust, fear, surprise, and neutral with the\nproposed CNNEELM model. The study shows that the overall facial emotion\nrecognition accuracy is improved by 2% than the state of art solutions with a\nmodified Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) technique. With the Extreme Learning\nMachine (ELM) classifier, the processing time is brought down to 65ms from\n113ms, which can smoothly classify each frame from a video clip at 20fps. With\nthe pre-trained InceptionV3 model, the proposed CNNEELM model is trained with\nJAFFE, CK+, and FER2013 expression datasets. The simulation results show\nsignificant improvements in accuracy and processing time, making the model\nsuitable for the video analysis process. Besides, the study solves the issue of\nthe large processing time required to process the facial images.",

    "abstract": "In the era of deep learning, loss functions determine the range of tasks\navailable to models and algorithms. To support the application of deep learning\nin multi-label classification (MLC) tasks, we propose the ZLPR (zero-bounded\nlog-sum-exp \\& pairwise rank-based) loss in this paper. Compared to other\nrank-based losses for MLC, ZLPR can handel problems that the number of target\nlabels is uncertain, which, in this point of view, makes it equally capable\nwith the other two strategies often used in MLC, namely the binary relevance\n(BR) and the label powerset (LP). Additionally, ZLPR takes the corelation\nbetween labels into consideration, which makes it more comprehensive than the\nBR methods. In terms of computational complexity, ZLPR can compete with the BR\nmethods because its prediction is also label-independent, which makes it take\nless time and memory than the LP methods. Our experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of ZLPR on multiple benchmark datasets and multiple evaluation\nmetrics. Moreover, we propose the soft version and the corresponding\nKL-divergency calculation method of ZLPR, which makes it possible to apply some\nregularization tricks such as label smoothing to enhance the generalization of\nmodels.",

Moreover, reducing the high confidence noise in\npseudo-labels and addressing the problem of image gradient disappearance during\ntranslation are still under-explored, and keeping edges from being distorted\nduring translation is also challenging.

    "abstract": "In large-scale recommender systems, retrieving top N relevant candidates\naccurately with resource constrain is crucial. To evaluate the performance of\nsuch retrieval models, Recall@N, the frequency of positive samples being\nretrieved in the top N ranking, is widely used. However, most of the\nconventional loss functions for retrieval models such as softmax cross-entropy\nand pairwise comparison methods do not directly optimize Recall@N. Moreover,\nthose conventional loss functions cannot be customized for the specific\nretrieval size N required by each application and thus may lead to sub-optimal\nperformance. In this paper, we proposed the Customizable Recall@N Optimization\nLoss (CROLoss), a loss function that can directly optimize the Recall@N metrics\nand is customizable for different choices of N. This proposed CROLoss\nformulation defines a more generalized loss function space, covering most of\nthe conventional loss functions as special cases. Furthermore, we develop the\nLambda method, a gradient-based method that invites more flexibility and can\nfurther boost the system performance. We evaluate the proposed CROLoss on two\npublic benchmark datasets. The results show that CROLoss achieves SOTA results\nover conventional loss functions for both datasets with various choices of\nretrieval size N. CROLoss has been deployed onto our online E-commerce\nadvertising platform, where a fourteen-day online A/B test demonstrated that\nCROLoss contributes to a significant business revenue growth of 4.75%.",

    "abstract": "Open checkout-free grocery is the grocery store where the customers never\nhave to wait in line to check out. Developing a system like this is not trivial\nsince it faces challenges of recognizing the dynamic and massive flow of\npeople. In particular, a clustering method that can efficiently assign each\nsnapshot to the corresponding customer is essential for the system. In order to\naddress the unique challenges in the open checkout-free grocery, we propose an\nefficient and effective person clustering method. Specifically, we first\npropose a Crowded Sub-Graph (CSG) to localize the relationship among massive\nand continuous data streams. CSG is constructed by the proposed\nPick-Link-Weight (PLW) strategy, which \\textbf{picks} the nodes based on\ntime-space information, \\textbf{links} the nodes via trajectory information,\nand \\textbf{weighs} the links by the proposed von Mises-Fisher (vMF) similarity\nmetric. Then, to ensure that the method adapts to the dynamic and unseen person\nflow, we propose Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with a simple Nearest\nNeighbor (NN) strategy to accurately cluster the instances of CSG. GCN is\nadopted to project the features into low-dimensional separable space, and NN is\nable to quickly produce a result in this space upon dynamic person flow. The\nexperimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other\nalternative algorithms in this scenario. In practice, the whole system has been\nimplemented and deployed in several real-world open checkout-free groceries.",

As such, constant\nresearch efforts have been put to optimize its performance in the distributed\nenvironment, which is typically characterized by reducing the number of\nCartesian products as much as possible. In this article, we design and\nimplement a novel fast theta-join algorithm, called Prefap, by developing two\ndistinct techniques - prefiltering and amalgamated partitioning-based on the\nstate-of-the-art FastThetaJoin algorithm to optimize the efficiency of the\ntheta-join operation. Firstly, we develop a prefiltering strategy before data\nstreams are partitioned to reduce the amount of data to be involved and benefit\na more fine-grained partitioning. Secondly, to avoid the data streams being\npartitioned in a coarse-grained isolated manner and improve the quality of the\npartition-level filtering, we introduce an amalgamated partitioning mechanism\nthat can amalgamate the partitioning boundaries of two data streams to assist a\nfine-grained partitioning. With the integration of these two techniques into\nthe existing FastThetaJoin algorithm, we design and implement a new framework\nto achieve a decreased number of Cartesian products and a higher theta-join\nefficiency.

The data facilitates research in\necological monitoring, land management and desertification, etc. The\ncharacteristics of RS data (e.g., enormous volume, large single-file size and\ndemanding requirement of fault tolerance) make the Hadoop Distributed File\nSystem (HDFS) an ideal choice for RS data storage as it is efficient, scalable\nand equipped with a data replication mechanism for failure resilience. To use\nRS data, one of the most important techniques is geospatial indexing. However,\nthe large data volume makes it time-consuming to efficiently construct and\nleverage. Considering that most modern geospatial data centres are equipped\nwith HDFS-based big data processing infrastructures, deploying multiple\ngeospatial indices becomes natural to optimise the efficacy. Moreover, because\nof the reliability introduced by high-quality hardware and the infrequently\nmodified property of the RS data, the use of multi-indexing will not cause\nlarge overhead. Therefore, we design a framework called Multi-IndeXing-RS\n(MIX-RS) that unifies the multi-indexing mechanism on top of the HDFS with data\nreplication enabled for both fault tolerance and geospatial indexing\nefficiency. Given the fault tolerance provided by the HDFS, RS data is\nstructurally stored inside for faster geospatial indexing. Additionally,\nmulti-indexing enhances efficiency.

The popularity of AMG stems from its potential to solve linear\nsystems in almost linear time, that is with an O(n) complexity, where n is the\nproblem size. This capability is crucial at the present, where the increasing\navailability of massive HPC platforms pushes for the solution of very large\nproblems. The key for a rapidly converging AMG method is a good interplay\nbetween the smoother and the coarse-grid correction, which in turn requires the\nuse of an effective prolongation.

    "title": "Localized Sparse Incomplete Multi-view Clustering",
    "abstract": "Incomplete multi-view clustering, which aims to solve the clustering problem\non the incomplete multi-view data with partial view missing, has received more\nand more attention in recent years. Although numerous methods have been\ndeveloped, most of the methods either cannot flexibly handle the incomplete\nmulti-view data with arbitrary missing views or do not consider the negative\nfactor of information imbalance among views. Moreover, some methods do not\nfully explore the local structure of all incomplete views. To tackle these\nproblems, this paper proposes a simple but effective method, named localized\nsparse incomplete multi-view clustering (LSIMVC). Different from the existing\nmethods, LSIMVC intends to learn a sparse and structured consensus latent\nrepresentation from the incomplete multi-view data by optimizing a sparse\nregularized and novel graph embedded multi-view matrix factorization model.\nSpecifically, in such a novel model based on the matrix factorization, a l1\nnorm based sparse constraint is introduced to obtain the sparse low-dimensional\nindividual representations and the sparse consensus representation. Moreover, a\nnovel local graph embedding term is introduced to learn the structured\nconsensus representation. Different from the existing works, our local graph\nembedding term aggregates the graph embedding task and consensus representation\nlearning task into a concise term. Furthermore, to reduce the imbalance factor\nof incomplete multi-view learning, an adaptive weighted learning scheme is\nintroduced to LSIMVC. Finally, an efficient optimization strategy is given to\nsolve the optimization problem of our proposed model. Comprehensive\nexperimental results performed on six incomplete multi-view databases verify\nthat the performance of our LSIMVC is superior to the state-of-the-art IMC\napproaches.

    "abstract": "Layer 2 systems have received increasing attention due to their potential to\nscale the throughput of L1 blockchains. To avoid the cost of putting data on\nchain, these systems increasingly turn to off-chain data availability solutions\nsuch as data availability commitees (DACs). However, placing trust on DACs\nconflicts with the goal of obtaining an L2 architecture whose security relies\nsolely on the L1 chain. To eliminate such trust assumptions, we propose a DAC\nprotocol that provides financial incentives to deter the DAC nodes from\nadversarial behavior. We then analyze the interaction of rational DAC nodes and\nclients as a dynamic game, with a Byzantine adversary that can corrupt and\nbribe the participants. We also define a notion of optimality for the DAC\nprotocols, inspired by fairness and economic feasibility. Our main result shows\nthat our protocol is optimal and guarantees security with the highest possible\nprobability under reasonable assumptions on the adversary.",

    "abstract": "Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) can solve complex cooperative tasks.\nHowever, the efficiency of existing MARL methods relies heavily on well-defined\nreward functions. Multiagent tasks with sparse reward feedback are especially\nchallenging not only because of the credit distribution problem, but also due\nto the low probability of obtaining positive reward feedback. In this paper, we\ndesign a graph network called Cooperation Graph (CG). The Cooperation Graph is\nthe combination of two simple bipartite graphs, namely, the Agent Clustering\nsubgraph (ACG) and the Cluster Designating subgraph (CDG). Next, based on this\nnovel graph structure, we propose a Cooperation Graph Multiagent Reinforcement\nLearning (CG-MARL) algorithm, which can efficiently deal with the sparse reward\nproblem in multiagent tasks. In CG-MARL, agents are directly controlled by the\nCooperation Graph. And a policy neural network is trained to manipulate this\nCooperation Graph, guiding agents to achieve cooperation in an implicit way.\nThis hierarchical feature of CG-MARL provides space for customized\ncluster-actions, an extensible interface for introducing fundamental\ncooperation knowledge.

    "abstract": "Mainstream object detectors are commonly constituted of two sub-tasks,\nincluding classification and regression tasks, implemented by two parallel\nheads. This classic design paradigm inevitably leads to inconsistent spatial\ndistributions between classification score and localization quality (IOU).\nTherefore, this paper alleviates this misalignment in the view of knowledge\ndistillation. First, we observe that the massive teacher achieves a higher\nproportion of harmonious predictions than the lightweight student. Based on\nthis intriguing observation, a novel Harmony Score (HS) is devised to estimate\nthe alignment of classification and regression qualities. HS models the\nrelationship between two sub-tasks and is seen as prior knowledge to promote\nharmonious predictions for the student. Second, this spatial misalignment will\nresult in inharmonious region selection when distilling features. To alleviate\nthis problem, a novel Task-decoupled Feature Distillation (TFD) is proposed by\nflexibly balancing the contributions of classification and regression tasks.\nEventually, HD and TFD constitute the proposed method, named Task-Balanced\nDistillation (TBD). Extensive experiments demonstrate the considerable\npotential and generalization of the proposed method.

    "abstract": "Compressed video super-resolution (VSR) aims to restore high-resolution\nframes from compressed low-resolution counterparts. Most recent VSR approaches\noften enhance an input frame by borrowing relevant textures from neighboring\nvideo frames. Although some progress has been made, there are grand challenges\nto effectively extract and transfer high-quality textures from compressed\nvideos where most frames are usually highly degraded. In this paper, we propose\na novel Frequency-Transformer for compressed video super-resolution (FTVSR)\nthat conducts self-attention over a joint space-time-frequency domain. First,\nwe divide a video frame into patches, and transform each patch into DCT\nspectral maps in which each channel represents a frequency band. Such a design\nenables a fine-grained level self-attention on each frequency band, so that\nreal visual texture can be distinguished from artifacts, and further utilized\nfor video frame restoration. Second, we study different self-attention schemes,\nand discover that a divided attention which conducts a joint space-frequency\nattention before applying temporal attention on each frequency band, leads to\nthe best video enhancement quality. Experimental results on two widely-used\nvideo super-resolution benchmarks show that FTVSR outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches on both uncompressed and compressed videos with clear visual\nmargins.

However, in most of the public visual question answering\ndatasets such as VQA, CLEVR, the questions are human generated that specific to\nthe given image, such as `What color are her eyes?'. The human generated\ncrowdsourcing questions are relatively simple and sometimes have the bias\ntoward certain entities or attributes. In this paper, we introduce a new\nquestion answering dataset based on image-ChiQA. It contains the real-world\nqueries issued by internet users, combined with several related open-domain\nimages. The system should determine whether the image could answer the question\nor not. Different from previous VQA datasets, the questions are real-world\nimage-independent queries that are more various and unbiased. Compared with\nprevious image-retrieval or image-caption datasets, the ChiQA not only measures\nthe relatedness but also measures the answerability, which demands more\nfine-grained vision and language reasoning. ChiQA contains more than 40K\nquestions and more than 200K question-images pairs. A three-level 2/1/0 label\nis assigned to each pair indicating perfect answer, partially answer and\nirrelevant. Data analysis shows ChiQA requires a deep understanding of both\nlanguage and vision, including grounding, comparisons, and reading.

    "abstract": "Many commodity sensors that measure the robot and dynamic obstacle's state\nhave non-Gaussian noise characteristics. Yet, many current approaches treat the\nunderlying-uncertainty in motion and perception as Gaussian, primarily to\nensure computational tractability. On the other hand, existing planners working\nwith non-Gaussian uncertainty do not shed light on leveraging distributional\ncharacteristics of motion and perception noise, such as bias for efficient\ncollision avoidance.\nThis paper fills this gap by interpreting reactive collision avoidance as a\ndistribution matching problem between the collision constraint violations and\nDirac Delta distribution. To ensure fast reactivity in the planner, we embed\neach distribution in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space and reformulate the\ndistribution matching as minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between\nthe two distributions. We show that evaluating the MMD for a given control\ninput boils down to just matrix-matrix products. We leverage this insight to\ndevelop a simple control sampling approach for reactive collision avoidance\nwith dynamic and uncertain obstacles.\nWe advance the state-of-the-art in two respects. First, we conduct an\nextensive empirical study to show that our planner can infer distributional\nbias from sample-level information. Consequently, it uses this insight to guide\nthe robot to good homotopy. We also highlight how a Gaussian approximation of\nthe underlying uncertainty can lose the bias estimate and guide the robot to\nunfavorable states with a high collision probability. Second, we show tangible\ncomparative advantages of the proposed distribution matching approach for\ncollision avoidance with previous non-parametric and Gaussian approximated\nmethods of reactive collision avoidance.",

    "abstract": "Dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems, which can efficiently\nutilize the congested spectrum and costly hardware resources by employing one\ncommon waveform for both sensing and communication (S&C), have attracted\nincreasing attention. While the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\n(OFDM) technique has been widely adopted to support high-quality\ncommunications, it also has great potentials of improving radar sensing\nperformance and providing flexible S&C. In this paper, we propose to jointly\ndesign the dual-functional transmit signals occupying several subcarriers to\nrealize multi-user OFDM communications and detect one moving target in the\npresence of clutter. Meanwhile, the signals in other frequency subcarriers can\nbe optimized in a similar way to perform other tasks. The transmit beamforming\nand receive filter are jointly optimized to maximize the radar output\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), while satisfying the\ncommunication SINR requirement and the power budget. An majorization\nminimization (MM) method based algorithm is developed to solve the resulting\nnon-convex optimization problem. Numerical results reveal the significant\nwideband sensing gain brought by jointly designing the transmit signals in\ndifferent subcarriers, and demonstrate the advantages of our proposed scheme\nand the effectiveness of the developed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Image restoration algorithms such as super resolution (SR) are indispensable\npre-processing modules for object detection in low quality images. Most of\nthese algorithms assume the degradation is fixed and known a priori. However,\nin practical, either the real degradation or optimal up-sampling ratio rate is\nunknown or differs from assumption, leading to a deteriorating performance for\nboth the pre-processing module and the consequent high-level task such as\nobject detection. Here, we propose a novel self-supervised framework to detect\nobjects in degraded low resolution images. We utilizes the downsampling\ndegradation as a kind of transformation for self-supervised signals to explore\nthe equivariant representation against various resolutions and other\ndegradation conditions. The Auto Encoding Resolution in Self-supervision\n(AERIS) framework could further take the advantage of advanced SR architectures\nwith an arbitrary resolution restoring decoder to reconstruct the original\ncorrespondence from the degraded input image. Both the representation learning\nand object detection are optimized jointly in an end-to-end training fashion.\nThe generic AERIS framework could be implemented on various mainstream object\ndetection architectures with different backbones. The extensive experiments\nshow that our methods has achieved superior performance compared with existing\nmethods when facing variant degradation situations.

    "abstract": "Traffic forecasting is challenging due to dynamic and complicated\nspatial-temporal dependencies. However, existing methods still suffer from two\ncritical limitations. Firstly, many approaches typically utilize static\npre-defined or adaptively learned spatial graphs to capture dynamic\nspatial-temporal dependencies in the traffic system, which limits the\nflexibility and only captures shared patterns for the whole time, thus leading\nto sub-optimal performance. In addition, most approaches individually and\nindependently consider the absolute error between ground truth and predictions\nat each time step, which fails to maintain the global properties and statistics\nof time series as a whole and results in trend discrepancy between ground truth\nand predictions. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic Adaptive and\nAdversarial Graph Convolutional Network (DAAGCN), which combines Graph\nConvolution Networks (GCNs) with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for\ntraffic forecasting. Specifically, DAAGCN leverages a universal paradigm with a\ngate module to integrate time-varying embeddings with node embeddings to\ngenerate dynamic adaptive graphs for inferring spatial-temporal dependencies at\neach time step. Then, two discriminators are designed to maintain the\nconsistency of the global properties and statistics of predicted time series\nwith ground truth at the sequence and graph levels. Extensive experiments on\nfour benchmark datasets manifest that DAAGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art\nby average 5.05%, 3.80%, and 5.27%, in terms of MAE, RMSE, and MAPE, meanwhile,\nspeeds up convergence up to 9 times.

While such analytical\nexpressions are generally needed both for theoretical studies and for\ncomputer-based simulations, the latter motivates us here to derive\ndisk-cylinder interaction potential laws that are valid for arbitrary mutual\norientations in the decisive regime of small surface separations. The chosen\ntype of fundamental point-pair interaction follows the simple Lennard-Jones\nmodel with inverse power laws for both the adhesive van der Waals part and the\nsteric, repulsive part. We present three different solutions, ranging from\nhighest accuracy to the best trade-off between simplicity of the expression and\nsufficient accuracy for our intended use. The validity of simplifying\napproximations and the accuracy of the derived potential laws is thoroughly\nanalyzed, using both numerical and analytical reference solutions for specific\ninteraction cases. Most importantly, the correct asymptotic scaling behavior in\nthe decisive regime of small separations is achieved, and also the\ntheoretically predicted $(1\\!/\\!\\sin\\!\\alpha)$-angle dependence (for\nnon-parallel cylinders) is obtained by the proposed analytical solutions. As we\nshow in the outlook to our current research, the derived analytical\ndisk-cylinder interaction potential laws may be used to formulate highly\nefficient computational models for the interaction of arbitrarily curved\nfibers, such that the disk represents the cross-section of the first and the\ncylinder a local approximation to the shape of the second fiber.",

However, they lack\ngeneralization capability or suffer from computational burden when the size of\ngraphs is enormous. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-level GNN\nexplanation framework based on an observation that GNN is a multimodal learning\nprocess of multiple components in graph data. The complexity of the original\nproblem is relaxed by breaking into multiple sub-parts represented as a\nhierarchical structure. The top-level explanation aims at specifying the\ncontribution of each component to the model execution and predictions, while\nfine-grained levels focus on feature attribution and graph structure\nattribution analysis based on knowledge distillation. Student models are\ntrained in standalone modes and are responsible for capturing different teacher\nbehaviors, later used for particular component interpretation.

In recent\nyears, numerous sound and complete verification methods have been\nproposed towards that end, but these typically suffer from severe\nscalability limitations. Recent work has proposed enhancing such\nverification techniques with abstraction-refinement capabilities,\nwhich have been shown to boost scalability: instead of verifying a\nlarge and complex network, the verifier constructs and then verifies\na much smaller network, whose correctness implies the correctness of\nthe original network. A shortcoming of such a scheme is that if\nverifying the smaller network fails, the verifier needs to perform a\nrefinement step that increases the size of the network being\nverified, and then start verifying the new network from scratch --\neffectively ``wasting'' its earlier work on verifying the smaller\nnetwork. In this paper, we present an enhancement to\nabstraction-based verification of neural networks, by using\n\\emph{residual reasoning}: the process of utilizing information\nacquired when verifying an abstract network, in order to expedite\nthe verification of a refined network. In essence, the method allows\nthe verifier to store information about parts of the search space in\nwhich the refined network is guaranteed to behave correctly, and\nallows it to focus on areas where bugs might be discovered.

    "abstract": "The logic of hybrid MKNF (minimal knowledge and negation as failure) is a\npowerful knowledge representation language that elegantly pairs ASP (answer set\nprogramming) with ontologies. Disjunctive rules are a desirable extension to\nnormal rule-based reasoning and typically semantic frameworks designed for\nnormal knowledge bases need substantial restructuring to support disjunctive\nrules. Alternatively, one may lift characterizations of normal rules to support\ndisjunctive rules by inducing a collection of normal knowledge bases, each with\nthe same body and a single atom in its head. In this work, we refer to a set of\nsuch normal knowledge bases as a head-cut of a disjunctive knowledge base. The\nquestion arises as to whether the semantics of disjunctive hybrid MKNF\nknowledge bases can be characterized using fixpoint constructions with\nhead-cuts. Earlier, we have shown that head-cuts can be paired with fixpoint\noperators to capture the two-valued MKNF models of disjunctive hybrid MKNF\nknowledge bases. Three-valued semantics extends two-valued semantics with the\nability to express partial information. In this work, we present a fixpoint\nconstruction that leverages head-cuts using an operator that iteratively\ncaptures three-valued models of hybrid MKNF knowledge bases with disjunctive\nrules. This characterization also captures partial stable models of disjunctive\nlogic programs since a program can be expressed as a disjunctive hybrid MKNF\nknowledge base with an empty ontology.

This assumption is not always realistic in\nseveral situations (e.g., the human might decide to update her model and the\nrobot is unaware of the updates).\nIn this paper, we propose a dialog-based approach for computing explanations\nof MRPs under the assumptions that (i) the robot does not know the human model;\n(ii) the human and the robot share the set of predicates of the planning domain\nand their exchanges are about action descriptions and fluents' values; (iii)\ncommunication between the parties is perfect; and (iv) the parties are\ntruthful. A solution of a MRP is computed through a dialog, defined as a\nsequence of rounds of exchanges, between the robot and the human. In each\nround, the robot sends a potential explanation, called proposal, to the human\nwho replies with her evaluation of the proposal, called response. We develop\nalgorithms for computing proposals by the robot and responses by the human and\nimplement these algorithms in a system that combines imperative means with\nanswer set programming using the multi-shot feature of clingo.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) systems represent knowledge as\ncollections of facts and rules. Like databases, KRR systems contain information\nabout domains of human activities like industrial enterprises, science, and\nbusiness. KRRs can represent complex concepts and relations, and they can query\nand manipulate information in sophisticated ways. Unfortunately, the KRR\ntechnology has been hindered by the fact that specifying the requisite\nknowledge requires skills that most domain experts do not have, and\nprofessional knowledge engineers are hard to find. One solution could be to\nextract knowledge from English text, and a number of works have attempted to do\nso (OpenSesame, Google's Sling, etc.). Unfortunately, at present, extraction of\nlogical facts from unrestricted natural language is still too inaccurate to be\nused for reasoning, while restricting the grammar of the language (so-called\ncontrolled natural language, or CNL) is hard for the users to learn and use.\nNevertheless, some recent CNL-based approaches, such as the Knowledge Authoring\nLogic Machine (KALM), have shown to have very high accuracy compared to others,\nand a natural question is to what extent the CNL restrictions can be lifted. In\nthis paper, we address this issue by transplanting the KALM framework to a\nneural natural language parser, mStanza. Here we limit our attention to\nauthoring facts and queries and therefore our focus is what we call factual\nEnglish statements. Authoring other types of knowledge, such as rules, will be\nconsidered in our followup work. As it turns out, neural network based parsers\nhave problems of their own and the mistakes they make range from part-of-speech\ntagging to lemmatization to dependency errors. We present a number of\ntechniques for combating these problems and test the new system, KALMFL (i.e.,\nKALM for factual language), on a number of benchmarks, which show KALMFL\nachieves correctness in excess of 95%.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to\nthe backdoor attacks, which leads to malicious behaviors of DNNs when specific\ntriggers are attached to the input images. It was further demonstrated that the\ninfected DNNs possess a collection of channels, which are more sensitive to the\nbackdoor triggers compared with normal channels. Pruning these channels was\nthen shown to be effective in mitigating the backdoor behaviors. To locate\nthose channels, it is natural to consider their Lipschitzness, which measures\ntheir sensitivity against worst-case perturbations on the inputs. In this work,\nwe introduce a novel concept called Channel Lipschitz Constant (CLC), which is\ndefined as the Lipschitz constant of the mapping from the input images to the\noutput of each channel. Then we provide empirical evidences to show the strong\ncorrelation between an Upper bound of the CLC (UCLC) and the trigger-activated\nchange on the channel activation. Since UCLC can be directly calculated from\nthe weight matrices, we can detect the potential backdoor channels in a\ndata-free manner, and do simple pruning on the infected DNN to repair the\nmodel. The proposed Channel Lipschitzness based Pruning (CLP) method is super\nfast, simple, data-free and robust to the choice of the pruning threshold.\nExtensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficiency and\neffectiveness of CLP, which achieves state-of-the-art results among the\nmainstream defense methods even without any data.

    "title": "A PTAS for Minimizing Weighted Flow Time on a Single Machine",
    "abstract": "An important objective in scheduling literature is to minimize the sum of\nweighted flow times. We are given a set of jobs where each job is characterized\nby a release time, a processing time, and a weight. Our goal is to find a\npreemptive schedule on a single machine that minimizes the sum of the weighted\nflow times of the jobs, where the flow time of a job is the time between its\ncompletion time and its release time. The currently best known polynomial time\nalgorithm for the problem is a (2+eps)-approximation by Rohwedder and Wiese\n[STOC 2021] which builds on the prior break-through result by Batra, Garg, and\nKumar [FOCS 2018] who found the first pseudo-polynomial time constant factor\napproximation algorithm for the problem, and on the result by Feige, Kulkarni,\nand Li [SODA 2019] who turned the latter into a polynomial time algorithm.\nHowever, it remains open whether the problem admits a PTAS. We answer this\nquestion in the affirmative and present a polynomial time (1+eps)-approximation\nalgorithm for weighted flow time on a single machine. We rely on a reduction of\nthe problem to a geometric covering problem, which was introduced in the\nmentioned (2+eps)-approximation algorithm, losing a factor 1+eps in the\napproximation ratio. However, unlike that algorithm, we solve the resulting\ninstances of this problem exactly, rather than losing a factor 2+eps. Key for\nthis is to identify and exploit structural properties of instances of the\ngeometric covering problem which arise in the reduction from weighted flow\ntime.",

We apply\nthis network on synthetic renderings and show that it generalizes sufficiently\nfrom real images to simulated images.

    "abstract": "In recent years, researchers have created and introduced a significant number\nof various code generation models. As human evaluation of every new model\nversion is unfeasible, the community adopted automatic evaluation metrics such\nas BLEU to approximate the results of human judgement. These metrics originate\nfrom the machine translation domain and it is unclear whether they are\napplicable for the code generation tasks and how well do they agree with the\nhuman evaluation on this task. There also are two metrics, CodeBLEU and RUBY,\nthat were developed to estimate the similarity of code and take into account\nthe code properties. However, for these metrics there are hardly any studies on\ntheir agreement with the human evaluation. Despite all that, minimal\ndifferences in the metric scores are used to claim superiority of some code\ngeneration models over the others.\nIn this paper, we present a study on applicability of six metrics -- BLEU,\nROUGE-L, METEOR, ChrF, CodeBLEU, RUBY -- for evaluation of the code generation\nmodels. We conduct a study on two different code generation datasets and use\nhuman annotators to assess the quality of all models run on these datasets. The\nresults indicate that for the CoNaLa dataset of Python one-liners none of the\nmetrics can correctly emulate human judgement on which model is better with\n$>95\\%$ certainty if the difference in model scores is less than 5 points. For\nthe HearthStone dataset, which consists of classes of particular structure, the\ndifference in model scores of at least 2 points is enough to claim the\nsuperiority of one model over the other. Using our findings, we derive several\nrecommendations on using metrics to estimate the model performance on the code\ngeneration task.",

Distributed SGD may suffer from the effect of stragglers, i.e., slow or\nunresponsive workers who cause delays. One solution studied in the literature\nis to wait at each iteration for the responses of the fastest $k<n$ workers\nbefore updating the model, where $k$ is a fixed parameter. The choice of the\nvalue of $k$ presents a trade-off between the runtime (i.e., convergence rate)\nof SGD and the error of the model. Towards optimizing the error-runtime\ntrade-off, we investigate distributed SGD with adaptive~$k$, i.e., varying $k$\nthroughout the runtime of the algorithm. We first design an adaptive policy for\nvarying $k$ that optimizes this trade-off based on an upper bound on the error\nas a function of the wall-clock time that we derive. Then, we propose and\nimplement an algorithm for adaptive distributed SGD that is based on a\nstatistical heuristic. Our results show that the adaptive version of\ndistributed SGD can reach lower error values in less time compared to\nnon-adaptive implementations. Moreover, the results also show that the adaptive\nversion is communication-efficient, where the amount of communication required\nbetween the master and the workers is less than that of non-adaptive versions.",

    "abstract": "Forensic iris recognition, as opposed to live iris recognition, is an\nemerging research area that leverages the discriminative power of iris\nbiometrics to aid human examiners in their efforts to identify deceased\npersons. As a machine learning-based technique in a predominantly\nhuman-controlled task, forensic recognition serves as \"back-up\" to human\nexpertise in the task of post-mortem identification. As such, the machine\nlearning model must be (a) interpretable, and (b) post-mortem-specific, to\naccount for changes in decaying eye tissue. In this work, we propose a method\nthat satisfies both requirements, and that approaches the creation of a\npost-mortem-specific feature extractor in a novel way employing human\nperception. We first train a deep learning-based feature detector on\npost-mortem iris images, using annotations of image regions highlighted by\nhumans as salient for their decision making. In effect, the method learns\ninterpretable features directly from humans, rather than purely data-driven\nfeatures. Second, regional iris codes (again, with human-driven filtering\nkernels) are used to pair detected iris patches, which are translated into\npairwise, patch-based comparison scores. In this way, our method presents human\nexaminers with human-understandable visual cues in order to justify the\nidentification decision and corresponding confidence score. When tested on a\ndataset of post-mortem iris images collected from 259 deceased subjects, the\nproposed method places among the three best iris matchers, demonstrating better\nresults than the commercial (non-human-interpretable) VeriEye approach. We\npropose a unique post-mortem iris recognition method trained with human\nsaliency to give fully-interpretable comparison outcomes for use in the context\nof forensic examination, achieving state-of-the-art recognition performance.",

TransPillars aggregates spatial-temporal point cloud features\nfrom two perspectives. First, it fuses voxel-level features directly from\nmulti-frame feature maps instead of pooled instance features to preserve\ninstance details with contextual information that are essential to accurate\nobject localization. Second, it introduces a hierarchical coarse-to-fine\nstrategy to fuse multi-scale features progressively to effectively capture the\nmotion of moving objects and guide the aggregation of fine features. Besides, a\nvariant of deformable transformer is introduced to improve the effectiveness of\ncross-frame feature matching. Extensive experiments show that our proposed\nTransPillars achieves state-of-art performance as compared to existing\nmulti-frame detection approaches. Code will be released.",

The direct evaluation of a\nmolecular interaction potential between two general bodies in 3D space would\nrequire to integrate molecule densities over two 3D volumes, leading to a\nsixfold integral to be solved numerically. By exploiting the short-range nature\nof the considered class of interaction potentials as well as the fundamental\nkinematic assumption of undeformable fiber cross-sections, as typically applied\nin mechanical beam theories, a recently derived, closed-form analytical\nsolution is applied for the interaction potential between a given section of\nthe first fiber (slave beam) and the entire second fiber (master beam). This\nnovel approach based on a pre-defined section-beam interaction potential (SBIP)\nrequires only one single integration step along the slave beam length to be\nperformed numerically. In terms of accuracy, the total beam-beam interaction\npotential resulting from this approach is shown to exhibit an asymptotically\nconsistent angular and distance scaling behavior. In addition to elementary\ntwo-fiber systems, carefully chosen to verify accuracy and asymptotic\nconsistence of the proposed SBIP approach, a potential practical application in\nform of adhesive nanofiber-grafted surfaces is studied. Involving a large\nnumber of helicoidal fibers undergoing large 3D deformations, arbitrary mutual\nfiber orientations as well as frequent local fiber pull-off and\nsnap-into-contact events, this example demonstrates the robustness and\ncomputational efficiency of the new approach.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in the fingerprinting of deep neural networks detect\ninstances of models, placed in a black-box interaction scheme. Inputs used by\nthe fingerprinting protocols are specifically crafted for each precise model to\nbe checked for. While efficient in such a scenario, this nevertheless results\nin a lack of guarantee after a mere modification (like retraining,\nquantization) of a model. This paper tackles the challenges to propose i)\nfingerprinting schemes that are resilient to significant modifications of the\nmodels, by generalizing to the notion of model families and their variants, ii)\nan extension of the fingerprinting task encompassing scenarios where one wants\nto fingerprint not only a precise model (previously referred to as a detection\ntask) but also to identify which model family is in the black-box\n(identification task). We achieve both goals by demonstrating that benign\ninputs, that are unmodified images, for instance, are sufficient material for\nboth tasks. We leverage an information-theoretic scheme for the identification\ntask. We devise a greedy discrimination algorithm for the detection task. Both\napproaches are experimentally validated over an unprecedented set of more than\n1,000 networks.",

    "abstract": "Despite the ever-growing popularity of dashboards across a wide range of\ndomains, their authoring still remains a tedious and complex process. Current\ntools offer considerable support for creating individual visualizations but\nprovide limited support for discovering groups of visualizations that can be\ncollectively useful for composing analytic dashboards. To address this problem,\nwe present MEDLEY, a mixed-initiative interface that assists in dashboard\ncomposition by recommending dashboard collections (i.e., a logically grouped\nset of views and filtering widgets) that map to specific analytical intents.\nUsers can specify dashboard intents (namely, measure analysis, change analysis,\ncategory analysis, or distribution analysis) explicitly through an input panel\nin the interface or implicitly by selecting data attributes and views of\ninterest. The system recommends collections based on these analytic intents,\nand views and widgets can be selected to compose a variety of dashboards.\nMEDLEY also provides a lightweight direct manipulation interface to configure\ninteractions between views in a dashboard. Based on a study with 13\nparticipants performing both targeted and open-ended tasks, we discuss how\nMEDLEY's recommendations guide dashboard composition and facilitate different\nuser workflows. Observations from the study identify potential directions for\nfuture work, including combining manual view specification with dashboard\nrecommendations and designing natural language interfaces for dashboard\nauthoring.",

Deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) are state-of-the-art solutions for ROI segmentation, but\nrequire large amounts of annotated data during the training. However,\ncollecting large datasets from emerging treatments such as LITT is impractical.\nIn this paper, we propose a progressive brain lesion synthesis framework\n(PAVAE) to expand both the quantity and diversity of the training dataset.\nConcretely, our framework consists of two sequential networks: a mask synthesis\nnetwork and a mask-guided lesion synthesis network. To better employ extrinsic\ninformation to provide additional supervision during network training, we\ndesign a condition embedding block (CEB) and a mask embedding block (MEB) to\nencode inherent conditions of masks to the feature space.

Recent advances employ the predicted label distributions\nof individual samples to perform noise verification and noisy label correction,\neasily giving rise to confirmation bias. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nNeighborhood Collective Estimation, in which the predictive reliability of a\ncandidate sample is re-estimated by contrasting it against its feature-space\nnearest neighbors. Specifically, our method is divided into two steps: 1)\nNeighborhood Collective Noise Verification to separate all training samples\ninto a clean or noisy subset, 2) Neighborhood Collective Label Correction to\nrelabel noisy samples, and then auxiliary techniques are used to assist further\nmodel optimization.

We formulate a novel multilevel DLMC (MLDLMC)\nestimator, and perform a comprehensive work-error analysis yielding new and\nimproved complexity results.

Combining IS and MLDLMC not only reduces computational complexity by\none order, but also drastically reduces the associated constant, ensuring\nfeasible estimates for rare event quantities. We illustrate effectiveness of\nproposed MLDLMC estimator on the Kuramoto model from statistical physics with\nLipschitz observables, confirming reduced complexity from\n$\\mathcal{O}(TOL_r^{-4})$ for the single level DLMC estimator to\n$\\mathcal{O}(TOL_r^{-3})$ while providing feasible estimation for rare event\nquantities up to the prescribed relative error tolerance $TOL_r$.",

    "abstract": "Task generalization has been a long standing challenge in Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP). Recent research attempts to improve the task generalization\nability of pre-trained language models by mapping NLP tasks into human-readable\nprompted forms. However, these approaches require laborious and inflexible\nmanual collection of prompts, and different prompts on the same downstream task\nmay receive unstable performance. We propose Unified Schema Prompt, a flexible\nand extensible prompting method, which automatically customizes the learnable\nprompts for each task according to the task input schema. It models the shared\nknowledge between tasks, while keeping the characteristics of different task\nschema, and thus enhances task generalization ability. The schema prompt takes\nthe explicit data structure of each task to formulate prompts so that little\nhuman effort is involved. To test the task generalization ability of schema\nprompt at scale, we conduct schema prompt-based multitask pre-training on a\nwide variety of general NLP tasks. The framework achieves strong zero-shot and\nfew-shot generalization performance on 16 unseen downstream tasks from 8 task\ntypes (e.g., QA, NLI, etc). Furthermore, comprehensive analyses demonstrate the\neffectiveness of each component in the schema prompt, its flexibility in task\ncompositionality, and its ability to improve performance under a full-data\nfine-tuning setting.",

These probabilistic models are informative and robust while\nallowing large displacements by design. As the displacement distributions are\ntypically estimated on a subset of points (which we refer to as driving\npoints), due to computational requirements, we propose in this work to learn a\ndriving points predictor.

Events related to one object\nform an event sequence called a case. A case describes an end-to-end run\nthrough a process. The cases contained in event data can be used to discover a\nprocess model, detect frequent bottlenecks, or learn predictive models.\nHowever, events encountered in real-life information systems, e.g., ERP\nsystems, can often be associated with multiple objects. The traditional\nsequential case concept falls short of these object-centric event data as these\ndata exhibit a graph structure. One might force object-centric event data into\nthe traditional case concept by flattening it. However, flattening manipulates\nthe data and removes information. Therefore, a concept analogous to the case\nconcept of traditional event logs is necessary to enable the application of\ndifferent process mining tasks on object-centric event data. In this paper, we\nintroduce the case concept for object-centric process mining: process\nexecutions. These are graph-based generalizations of cases as considered in\ntraditional process mining. Furthermore, we provide techniques to extract\nprocess executions. Based on these executions, we determine equivalent process\nbehavior with respect to an attribute using graph isomorphism. Equivalent\nprocess executions with respect to the event's activity are object-centric\nvariants, i.e., a generalization of variants in traditional process mining. We\nprovide a visualization technique for object-centric variants. The\ncontribution's scalability and efficiency are extensively evaluated.\nFurthermore, we provide a case study showing the most frequent object-centric\nvariants of a real-life event log.",

To solve the\npolicy evaluation sub-problem in the presence of the deadly triad, we propose a\ngeneric algorithm framework of multi-step TD-learning with generalized\nimportance sampling ratios, which includes two specific algorithms: the\n$\\lambda$-averaged $Q$-trace and the two-sided $Q$-trace. The generic algorithm\nis single time-scale, has provable finite-sample guarantees, and overcomes the\nhigh variance issue in off-policy learning.\nAs for the policy update, we provide a universal analysis using only the\ncontraction property and the monotonicity property of the Bellman operator to\nestablish the geometric convergence under various policy update rules.\nImportantly, by viewing NPG as an approximate way of implementing policy\niteration, we establish the geometric convergence of NPG without introducing\nregularization, and without using mirror descent type of analysis as in\nexisting literature. Combining the geometric convergence of the policy update\nwith the finite-sample analysis of the policy evaluation, we establish for the\nfirst time an overall $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity for\nfinding an optimal policy (up to a function approximation error) using\npolicy-based methods under off-policy sampling and linear function\napproximation.",

    "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems (CRS) have shown great success in\naccurately capturing a user's current and detailed preference through the\nmulti-round interaction cycle while effectively guiding users to a more\npersonalized recommendation. Perhaps surprisingly, conversational recommender\nsystems can be plagued by popularity bias, much like traditional recommender\nsystems. In this paper, we systematically study the problem of popularity bias\nin CRSs. We demonstrate the existence of popularity bias in existing\nstate-of-the-art CRSs from an exposure rate, a success rate, and a\nconversational utility perspective, and propose a suite of popularity bias\nmetrics designed specifically for the CRS setting. We then introduce a\ndebiasing framework with three unique features: (i) Popularity-Aware Focused\nLearning to reduce the popularity-distorting impact on preference prediction;\n(ii) Cold-Start Item Embedding Reconstruction via Attribute Mapping, to improve\nthe modeling of cold-start items; and (iii) Dual-Policy Learning, to better\nguide the CRS when dealing with either popular or unpopular items. Through\nextensive experiments on two frequently used CRS datasets, we find the proposed\nmodel-agnostic debiasing framework not only mitigates the popularity bias in\nstate-of-the-art CRSs but also improves the overall recommendation performance.",

    "abstract": "Context: In the Requirements Engineering (RE) process of an Open Source\nSoftware (OSS) community, an involved firm is a stakeholder among many.\nConflicting agendas may create miss-alignment with the firm's internal\nrequirements strategy. In communities with meritocratic governance or with\naspects thereof, a firm has the opportunity to affect the RE process in line\nwith their own agenda by gaining influence through active and symbiotic\nengagements.\nObjective: The focus of this study has been to identify what aspects that\nfirms should consider when they assess their need of influencing the RE process\nin an OSS community, as well as what engagement practices that should be\nconsidered in order to gain this influence.\nMethod: Using a design science approach, 21 interviews with 18 industry\nprofessionals from 12 different software-intensive firms were conducted to\nexplore, design and validate an artifact for the problem context.\nResults: A Community Strategy Framework (CSF) is presented to help firms\ncreate community strategies that describe if and why they need influence on the\nRE process in a specific (meritocratic) OSS community, and how the firm could\ngain it. The framework consists of aspects and engagement practices. The\naspects help determine how important an OSS project and its community is from\nbusiness and technical perspectives. A community perspective is used when\nconsidering the feasibility and potential in gaining influence. The engagement\npractices are intended as a tool-box for how a firm can engage with a community\nin order to build influence needed.\nConclusion: It is concluded from interview-based validation that the proposed\nCSF may provide support for firms in creating and tailoring community\nstrategies and help them to focus resources on communities that matter and gain\nthe influence needed on their respective RE processes.",

    "abstract": "We present Branch-Train-Merge (BTM), a communication-efficient algorithm for\nembarrassingly parallel training of large language models (LLMs). We show it is\npossible to independently train subparts of a new class of LLMs on different\nsubsets of the data, eliminating the massive multi-node synchronization\ncurrently required to train LLMs. BTM learns a set of independent expert LMs\n(ELMs), each specialized to a different textual domain, such as scientific or\nlegal text. These ELMs can be added and removed to update data coverage,\nensembled to generalize to new domains, or averaged to collapse back to a\nsingle LM for efficient inference. New ELMs are learned by branching from\n(mixtures of) ELMs in the current set, further training the parameters on data\nfor the new domain, and then merging the resulting model back into the set for\nfuture use. Experiments show that BTM improves in- and out-of-domain\nperplexities as compared to GPT-style Transformer LMs, when controlling for\ntraining cost. Through extensive analysis, we show that these results are\nrobust to different ELM initialization schemes, but require expert domain\nspecialization; LM ensembles with random data splits do not perform well. We\nalso present a study of scaling BTM into a new corpus of 64 domains (192B\nwhitespace-separated tokens in total); the resulting LM (22.4B total\nparameters) performs as well as a Transformer LM trained with 2.5 times more\ncompute. These gains grow with the number of domains, suggesting more\naggressive parallelism could be used to efficiently train larger models in\nfuture work.",

    "abstract": "Data poisoning considers an adversary that distorts the training set of\nmachine learning algorithms for malicious purposes. In this work, we bring to\nlight one conjecture regarding the fundamentals of data poisoning, which we\ncall the Lethal Dose Conjecture. The conjecture states: If $n$ clean training\nsamples are needed for accurate predictions, then in a size-$N$ training set,\nonly $\\Theta(N/n)$ poisoned samples can be tolerated while ensuring accuracy.\nTheoretically, we verify this conjecture in multiple cases. We also offer a\nmore general perspective of this conjecture through distribution\ndiscrimination. Deep Partition Aggregation (DPA) and its extension, Finite\nAggregation (FA) are recent approaches for provable defenses against data\npoisoning, where they predict through the majority vote of many base models\ntrained from different subsets of training set using a given learner. The\nconjecture implies that both DPA and FA are (asymptotically) optimal -- if we\nhave the most data-efficient learner, they can turn it into one of the most\nrobust defenses against data poisoning. This outlines a practical approach to\ndeveloping stronger defenses against poisoning via finding data-efficient\nlearners. Empirically, as a proof of concept, we show that by simply using\ndifferent data augmentations for base learners, we can respectively double and\ntriple the certified robustness of DPA on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB without\nsacrificing accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) applied to a device's radio-frequency fingerprint~(RFF)\nhas attracted significant attention in physical-layer authentications due to\nits extraordinary classification performance. Conventional DL-RFF techniques,\ntrained by adopting maximum likelihood estimation~(MLE), tend to overfit the\nchannel statistics embedded in the training dataset. This restricts their\npractical applications as it is challenging to collect sufficient training data\ncapturing the characteristics of all possible wireless channel environments. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a DL framework of disentangled\nrepresentation learning~(DRL) that first learns to factor the input signals\ninto a device-relevant component and a device-irrelevant component via\nadversarial learning. Then, it synthesizes a set of augmented signals by\nshuffling these two parts within a given training dataset for training of\nsubsequent RFF extractor. The implicit data augmentation in the proposed\nframework imposes a regularization on the RFF extractor to avoid the possible\noverfitting of device-irrelevant channel statistics, without collecting\nadditional data from unknown channels. Experiments validate that the proposed\napproach, referred to as DR-RFF, outperforms conventional methods in terms of\ngeneralizability to unknown complicated propagation environments, e.g.,\ndispersive multipath fading channels, even though all the training data are\ncollected in a simple environment with dominated direct line-of-sight~(LoS)\npropagation paths.",

    "abstract": "Human decision making behavior is observed with choice-response time data\nduring psychological experiments. Drift-diffusion models of this data consist\nof a Wiener first-passage time (WFPT) distribution and are described by\ncognitive parameters: drift rate, boundary separation, and starting point.\nThese estimated parameters are of interest to neuroscientists as they can be\nmapped to features of cognitive processes of decision making (such as speed,\ncaution, and bias) and related to brain activity. The observed patterns of RT\nalso reflect the variability of cognitive processes from trial to trial\nmediated by neural dynamics. We adapted a SincNet-based shallow neural network\narchitecture to fit the Drift-Diffusion model using EEG signals on every\nexperimental trial. The model consists of a SincNet layer, a depthwise spatial\nconvolution layer, and two separate FC layers that predict drift rate and\nboundary for each trial in-parallel. The SincNet layer parametrized the kernels\nin order to directly learn the low and high cutoff frequencies of bandpass\nfilters that are applied to the EEG data to predict drift and boundary\nparameters. During training, model parameters were updated by minimizing the\nnegative log likelihood function of WFPT distribution given trial RT. We\ndeveloped separate decision SincNet models for each participant performing a\ntwo-alternative forced-choice task. Our results showed that single-trial\nestimates of drift and boundary performed better at predicting RTs than the\nmedian estimates in both training and test data sets, suggesting that our model\ncan successfully use EEG features to estimate meaningful single-trial Diffusion\nmodel parameters.

The strategy demonstrates its efficiency in inviscid and viscous\nflows, for a wide range of Mach numbers, also in the incompressible limit. In\npurely inviscid flows, non-oscillatory approximations are obtained in the\npresence of shock waves. In the incompressible limit, accurate solutions are\ncomputed without pressure correction algorithms. The method shows its superior\nperformance for viscous high Mach number flows, achieving physically admissible\nsolutions without carbuncle effect and predictions of quantities of interest\nwith errors below 5%.\nOriginality/value: The FCFV method accurately evaluates, for a wide range of\ncompressible laminar flows, quantities of engineering interest, such as drag,\nlift and heat transfer coefficients, on unstructured meshes featuring distorted\nand highly stretched cells, with an aspect ratio up to ten thousand.

In this article, we focus on a specific type of SOP called spatial\npartitioning, which is a combinatorial problem due to the presence of discrete\nspatial units. Exact optimization methods do not scale with the size of the\nproblem, especially within practicable time limits. This motivated us to\ndevelop population-based metaheuristics for solving such SOPs. However, the\nsearch operators employed by these population-based methods are mostly designed\nfor real-parameter continuous optimization problems.

    "abstract": "Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI with maternal hyperoxia can assess\noxygen transport within the placenta and has emerged as a promising tool to\nstudy placental function. Measuring signal changes over time requires\nsegmenting the placenta in each volume of the time series. Due to the large\nnumber of volumes in the BOLD time series, existing studies rely on\nregistration to map all volumes to a manually segmented template. As the\nplacenta can undergo large deformation due to fetal motion, maternal motion,\nand contractions, this approach often results in a large number of discarded\nvolumes, where the registration approach fails. In this work, we propose a\nmachine learning model based on a U-Net neural network architecture to\nautomatically segment the placenta in BOLD MRI and apply it to segmenting each\nvolume in a time series. We use a boundary-weighted loss function to accurately\ncapture the placental shape.

    "abstract": "Tissue segmentation is the mainstay of pathological examination, whereas the\nmanual delineation is unduly burdensome. To assist this time-consuming and\nsubjective manual step, researchers have devised methods to automatically\nsegment structures in pathological images. Recently, automated machine and deep\nlearning based methods dominate tissue segmentation research studies. However,\nmost machine and deep learning based approaches are supervised and developed\nusing a large number of training samples, in which the pixelwise annotations\nare expensive and sometimes can be impossible to obtain. This paper introduces\na novel unsupervised learning paradigm by integrating an end-to-end deep\nmixture model with a constrained indicator to acquire accurate semantic tissue\nsegmentation. This constraint aims to centralise the components of deep mixture\nmodels during the calculation of the optimisation function. In so doing, the\nredundant or empty class issues, which are common in current unsupervised\nlearning methods, can be greatly reduced.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a medical AttentIon Denoising Super Resolution\nGenerative Adversarial Network (AID-SRGAN) for diographic image\nsuper-resolution. First, we present a medical practical degradation model that\nconsiders various degradation factors beyond downsampling. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first composite degradation model proposed for\nradiographic images. Furthermore, we propose AID-SRGAN, which can\nsimultaneously denoise and generate high-resolution (HR) radiographs. In this\nmodel, we introduce an attention mechanism into the denoising module to make it\nmore robust to complicated degradation. Finally, the SR module reconstructs the\nHR radiographs using the \"clean\" low-resolution (LR) radiographs. In addition,\nwe propose a separate-joint training approach to train the model, and extensive\nexperiments are conducted to show that the proposed method is superior to its\ncounterparts. e.g., our proposed method achieves $31.90$ of PSNR with a scale\nfactor of $4 \\times$, which is $7.05 \\%$ higher than that obtained by recent\nwork, SPSR [16].

    "abstract": "On the medical images, many of the tissues/lesions may be ambiguous. That is\nwhy the medical segmentation is typically annotated by a group of clinical\nexperts to mitigate the personal bias. However, this clinical routine also\nbrings new challenges to the application of machine learning algorithms.\nWithout a definite ground-truth, it will be difficult to train and evaluate the\ndeep learning models. When the annotations are collected from different\ngraders, a common choice is majority vote. However such a strategy ignores the\ndifference between the grader expertness. In this paper, we consider the task\nof predicting the segmentation with the calibrated inter-observer uncertainty.\nWe note that in clinical practice, the medical image segmentation is usually\nused to assist the disease diagnosis. Inspired by this observation, we propose\ndiagnosis-first principle, which is to take disease diagnosis as the criterion\nto calibrate the inter-observer segmentation uncertainty. Following this idea,\na framework named Diagnosis First segmentation Framework (DiFF) is proposed to\nestimate diagnosis-first segmentation from the raw images.Specifically, DiFF\nwill first learn to fuse the multi-rater segmentation labels to a single\nground-truth which could maximize the disease diagnosis performance. We dubbed\nthe fused ground-truth as Diagnosis First Ground-truth (DF-GT).Then, we further\npropose Take and Give Modelto segment DF-GT from the raw image. We verify the\neffectiveness of DiFF on three different medical segmentation tasks: OD/OC\nsegmentation on fundus images, thyroid nodule segmentation on ultrasound\nimages, and skin lesion segmentation on dermoscopic images. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed DiFF is able to significantly facilitate the\ncorresponding disease diagnosis, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art\nmulti-rater learning methods.",

    "abstract": "In neuroimaging analysis, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can\nwell assess brain function changes for brain diseases with no obvious\nstructural lesions. So far, most deep-learning-based fMRI studies take\nfunctional connectivity as the basic feature in disease classification.\nHowever, functional connectivity is often calculated based on time series of\npredefined regions of interest and neglects detailed information contained in\neach voxel, which may accordingly deteriorate the performance of diagnostic\nmodels. Another methodological drawback is the limited sample size for the\ntraining of deep models. In this study, we propose BrainFormer, a general\nhybrid Transformer architecture for brain disease classification with single\nfMRI volume to fully exploit the voxel-wise details with sufficient data\ndimensions and sizes. BrainFormer is constructed by modeling the local cues\nwithin each voxel with 3D convolutions and capturing the global relations among\ndistant regions with two global attention blocks. The local and global cues are\naggregated in BrainFormer by a single-stream model. To handle multisite data,\nwe propose a normalization layer to normalize the data into identical\ndistribution. Finally, a Gradient-based Localization-map Visualization method\nis utilized for locating the possible disease-related biomarker. We evaluate\nBrainFormer on five independently acquired datasets including ABIDE, ADNI,\nMPILMBB, ADHD-200 and ECHO, with diseases of autism, Alzheimer's disease,\ndepression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and headache disorders.\nThe results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of BrainFormer\nfor multiple brain diseases diagnosis. BrainFormer may promote\nneuroimaging-based precision diagnosis in clinical practice and motivate future\nstudy in fMRI analysis.

A range of HSI\nrestoration methods have been developed, yet their effectiveness in enhancing\nlow-light HSIs is constrained. This work focuses on the low-light HSI\nenhancement task, which aims to reveal the spatial-spectral information hidden\nin darkened areas. To facilitate the development of low-light HSI processing,\nwe collect a low-light HSI (LHSI) dataset of both indoor and outdoor scenes.\nBased on Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction, we developed an\nend-to-end data-driven low-light HSI enhancement (HSIE) approach trained on the\nLHSI dataset. With the observation that illumination is related to the\nlow-frequency component of HSI, while textural details are closely correlated\nto the high-frequency component, the proposed HSIE is designed to have two\nbranches. The illumination enhancement branch is adopted to enlighten the\nlow-frequency component with reduced resolution. The high-frequency refinement\nbranch is utilized for refining the high-frequency component via a predicted\nmask. In addition, to improve information flow and boost performance, we\nintroduce an effective channel attention block (CAB) with residual dense\nconnection, which served as the basic block of the illumination enhancement\nbranch. The effectiveness and efficiency of HSIE both in quantitative\nassessment measures and visual effects are demonstrated by experimental results\non the LHSI dataset.

In our previous research, we mathematically derived conflict-free\njoint decision-making that optimally satisfies players' probabilistic\npreference profiles. However, two problems exist regarding the optimal joint\ndecision-making method. First, as the number of choices increases, the\ncomputational cost of calculating the optimal joint selection probability\nmatrix explodes. Second, to derive the optimal joint selection probability\nmatrix, all players must disclose their probabilistic preferences. Now, it is\nnoteworthy that explicit calculation of the joint probability distribution is\nnot necessarily needed; what is necessary for collective decisions is sampling.\nThis study examines several sampling methods that converge to heuristic joint\nselection probability matrices that satisfy players' preferences. We show that\nthey can significantly reduce the above problems of computational cost and\nconfidentiality. We analyze the probability distribution each of the sampling\nmethods converges to, as well as the computational cost required and the\nconfidentiality secured. In particular, we introduce two conflict-free joint\nsampling methods through quantum interference of photons. The first system\nallows the players to hide their choices while satisfying the players'\npreferences almost perfectly when they have the same preferences. The second\nsystem, where the physical nature of light replaces the expensive computational\ncost, also conceals their choices under the assumption that they have a trusted\nthird party.",

    "title": "Beyond the Worst Case: Structured Convergence of High Dimensional Random  Walks",
    "abstract": "One of the most important properties of high dimensional expanders is that\nhigh dimensional random walks converge rapidly. This property has proven to be\nextremely useful in variety of fields in the theory of computer science from\nagreement testing to sampling, coding theory and more. In this paper we improve\nupon the result of Kaufman-Oppenheim and Alev-Lau regarding the convergence of\nrandom walks by presenting a structured version of their result. While previous\nworks examined the expansion in the viewpoint of the worst possible eigenvalue,\nin this work we relate the expansion of a function to the entire spectrum of\nthe random walk operator using the structure of the function. In some cases\nthis finer result can be much better than the worst case.\nIn order to prove our structured version of the convergence of random walks,\nwe present a general framework that allows us to relate the convergence of\nrandom walks to the trickling down theorem for the first time. Concretely, we\nshow that both the state of the art results for convergence of random walks and\nthe tricking down theorem can be derived using the same argument that we\npresent here. This new, unified, way of looking at the convergence of high\ndimensional random walks and the trickling down theorem gives us a new\nunderstanding of pseudorandom functions that allows us to consider pseudorandom\nfunctions in one-sided local spectral expanders for the first time.",

    "abstract": "Many modern algorithms for inverse problems and data assimilation rely on\nensemble Kalman updates to blend prior predictions with observed data. Ensemble\nKalman methods often perform well with a small ensemble size, which is\nessential in applications where generating each particle is costly. This paper\ndevelops a non-asymptotic analysis of ensemble Kalman updates that rigorously\nexplains why a small ensemble size suffices if the prior covariance has\nmoderate effective dimension due to fast spectrum decay or approximate\nsparsity. We present our theory in a unified framework, comparing several\nimplementations of ensemble Kalman updates that use perturbed observations,\nsquare root filtering, and localization. As part of our analysis, we develop\nnew dimension-free covariance estimation bounds for approximately sparse\nmatrices that may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Improving the position of minorities in networks via interventions is a\nchallenge of high theoretical and societal importance. In this work, we examine\nhow different network growth interventions impact the position of minority\nnodes in degree rankings over time. We distinguish between two kinds of\ninterventions: (i) group size interventions, such as introducing quotas, that\nregulate the ratio of incoming minority and majority nodes; and (ii)\nbehavioural interventions, such as homophily, i.e. varying how groups interact\nand connect to each other. We find that even extreme group size interventions\ndo not have a strong effect on the position of minorities in rankings if\ncertain behavioural changes do not manifest at the same time. For example,\nminority representation in rankings is not increased by high quotas if the\nactors in the network do not adopt homophilic behaviour. As a result, a key\nfinding of our research is that in order for the visibility of minorities to\nimprove, group size and behavioural interventions need to be coordinated.\nMoreover, their potential benefit is highly dependent on pre-intervention\nconditions in social networks. In a real-world case study, we explore the\neffectiveness of interventions to reach gender parity in academia. Our work\nlays a theoretical and computational foundation for further studies aiming to\nexplore the effectiveness of interventions in growing networks.",

    "abstract": "Estimating uncertainty is at the core of performing scientific measurements\nin HEP: a measurement is not useful without an estimate of its uncertainty. The\ngoal of uncertainty quantification (UQ) is inextricably linked to the question,\n\"how do we physically and statistically interpret these uncertainties?\" The\nanswer to this question depends not only on the computational task we aim to\nundertake, but also on the methods we use for that task. For artificial\nintelligence (AI) applications in HEP, there are several areas where\ninterpretable methods for UQ are essential, including inference, simulation,\nand control/decision-making. There exist some methods for each of these areas,\nbut they have not yet been demonstrated to be as trustworthy as more\ntraditional approaches currently employed in physics (e.g., non-AI frequentist\nand Bayesian methods).\nShedding light on the questions above requires additional understanding of\nthe interplay of AI systems and uncertainty quantification. We briefly discuss\nthe existing methods in each area and relate them to tasks across HEP. We then\ndiscuss recommendations for avenues to pursue to develop the necessary\ntechniques for reliable widespread usage of AI with UQ over the next decade.",

However, the\ncomputational cost of DDD simulations remains a bottleneck that limits its\nrange of applicability. Here, we introduce a new DDD-GNN framework in which the\nexpensive time-integration of dislocation motion is entirely substituted by a\ngraph neural network (GNN) model trained on DDD trajectories. As a first\napplication, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of our method on a\nsimple yet relevant model of a dislocation line gliding through a forest of\nobstacles. We show that the DDD-GNN model is stable and reproduces very well\nunseen ground-truth DDD simulation responses for a range of straining rates and\nobstacle densities, without the need to explicitly compute nodal forces or\ndislocation mobilities during time-integration. Our approach opens new\npromising avenues to accelerate DDD simulations and to incorporate more complex\ndislocation motion behaviors.",

Typically, the extent of the effusion is\nmanually measured by a sonographer, leading to significant\nintra-/inter-observer variability. In this work, we investigate the use of deep\nlearning (DL) to automate the process of pleural effusion segmentation from\nultrasound images. On two datasets acquired in a LMIC setting, we achieve\nmedian Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.82 and 0.74 respectively using\nthe nnU-net DL model. We also investigate the use of coordinate convolutions in\nthe DL model and find that this results in a statistically significant\nimprovement in the median DSC on the first dataset to 0.85, with no significant\nchange on the second dataset. This work showcases, for the first time, the\npotential of DL in automating the process of effusion assessment from\nultrasound in LMIC settings where there is often a lack of experienced\nradiologists to perform such tasks.",

    "abstract": "Approximate message passing (AMP) emerges as an effective iterative paradigm\nfor solving high-dimensional statistical problems. However, prior AMP theory --\nwhich focused mostly on high-dimensional asymptotics -- fell short of\npredicting the AMP dynamics when the number of iterations surpasses\n$o\\big(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}\\big)$ (with $n$ the problem dimension). To\naddress this inadequacy, this paper develops a non-asymptotic framework for\nunderstanding AMP in spiked matrix estimation. Built upon new decomposition of\nAMP updates and controllable residual terms, we lay out an analysis recipe to\ncharacterize the finite-sample behavior of AMP in the presence of an\nindependent initialization, which is further generalized to allow for spectral\ninitialization. As two concrete consequences of the proposed analysis recipe:\n(i) when solving $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ synchronization, we predict the behavior of\nspectrally initialized AMP for up to $O\\big(\\frac{n}{\\mathrm{poly}\\log n}\\big)$\niterations, showing that the algorithm succeeds without the need of a\nsubsequent refinement stage (as conjectured recently by\n\\citet{celentano2021local}); (ii) we characterize the non-asymptotic behavior\nof AMP in sparse PCA (in the spiked Wigner model) for a broad range of\nsignal-to-noise ratio.",
