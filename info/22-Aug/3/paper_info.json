    "abstract": "The electrostatic modeling of conductors is a fundamental challenge in\nvarious applications, including the prediction of parasitic effects in\nelectrical interconnects, the design of biasing networks, and the modeling of\nbiological, microelectromechanical, and sensing systems. The boundary element\nmethod (BEM) can be an effective simulation tool for these problems because it\nallows modeling three-dimensional objects with only a surface mesh. However,\nexisting BEM formulations can be restrictive because they make assumptions\nspecific to particular applications. For example, capacitance extraction\nformulations usually assume a constant electric scalar potential on the surface\nof each conductor and cannot be used to model a flowing current, nor to extract\nthe resistance. When modeling steady currents, many existing techniques do not\naddress mathematical challenges such as the null space associated with the\noperators representing the internal region of a conductor. We propose a more\ngeneral BEM framework based on the electric scalar potential for modeling\nconductive objects in various scenarios in a unified manner. Restrictive\napplication-specific assumptions are not made, and the aforementioned operator\nnull space is handled in an intuitive and rigorous manner. Numerical examples\ndrawn from diverse applications confirm the accuracy and generality of the\nproposed method.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent analysis and visualization of tables use techniques to\nautomatically recommend useful knowledge from data, thus freeing users from\ntedious multi-dimension data mining. While many studies have succeeded in\nautomating recommendations through rules or machine learning, it is difficult\nto generalize expert knowledge and provide explainable recommendations. In this\npaper, we present the recommendation of conditional formatting for the first\ntime, together with chart recommendation, to exemplify intelligent table\nanalysis. We propose analytical semantics over tables to uncover common\nanalysis pattern behind user-created analyses. Here, we design analytical\nsemantics by separating data focus from user intent, which extract the user\nmotivation from data and human perspective respectively. Furthermore, the ASTA\nframework is designed by us to apply analytical semantics to multiple automated\nrecommendations. ASTA framework extracts data features by designing signatures\nbased on expert knowledge, and enables data referencing at field- (chart) or\ncell-level (conditional formatting) with pre-trained models. Experiments show\nthat our framework achieves recall at top 1 of 62.86% on public chart corpora,\noutperforming the best baseline about 14%, and achieves 72.31% on the collected\ncorpus ConFormT, validating that ASTA framework is effective in providing\naccurate and explainable recommendations.",

    "abstract": "In-context learning refers to the ability of a model to condition on a prompt\nsequence consisting of in-context examples (input-output pairs corresponding to\nsome task) along with a new query input, and generate the corresponding output.\nCrucially, in-context learning happens only at inference time without any\nparameter updates to the model. While large language models such as GPT-3\nexhibit some ability to perform in-context learning, it is unclear what the\nrelationship is between tasks on which this succeeds and what is present in the\ntraining data. To make progress towards understanding in-context learning, we\nconsider the well-defined problem of training a model to in-context learn a\nfunction class (e.g., linear functions): that is, given data derived from some\nfunctions in the class, can we train a model to in-context learn \"most\"\nfunctions from this class? We show empirically that standard Transformers can\nbe trained from scratch to perform in-context learning of linear functions --\nthat is, the trained model is able to learn unseen linear functions from\nin-context examples with performance comparable to the optimal least squares\nestimator. In fact, in-context learning is possible even under two forms of\ndistribution shift: (i) between the training data of the model and\ninference-time prompts, and (ii) between the in-context examples and the query\ninput during inference. We also show that we can train Transformers to\nin-context learn more complex function classes -- namely sparse linear\nfunctions, two-layer neural networks, and decision trees -- with performance\nthat matches or exceeds task-specific learning algorithms.

However,\nthe academic discussion of the Metaverse still mainly focused on the system\ntechnical design, and few research studied Metaverse challenges from the\nperspective of consumers, i.e., Metaverse users. One difficulty is that the\nanalysis from the consumer's perspective requires interdisciplinary theoretical\nframework and quantifiable Quality of Experience (QoE) measurements. In this\narticle, pioneering from consumers' point of view, we explore an interaction\nbetween Metaverse system design and consumer behaviors. Specifically, we\nrethink the QoE and propose an interdisciplinary framework that encompasses\nboth the Metaverse service providers (MSPs) and consumer considerations. From\nthe macro perspective, we introduce a joint optimization scheme that\nsimultaneously considers the Metaverse system design, consumers' utility, and\nprofitability of the MSPs. From the micro perspective, we advocate the\nWillingness-to-Pay (WTP) as an easy-to-implement QoE measurement for future\nMetaverse system studies. To illustrate the usability of the proposed\nintegrated framework, a use case of Metaverse, i.e., virtual traveling, is\npresented.

    "abstract": "Motivation: Society's dependence on Open Source Software (OSS) and the\ncommunities that maintain the OSS is ever-growing. So are the potential risks\nof, e.g., vulnerabilities being introduced in projects not actively maintained.\nBy assessing an OSS project's capability to stay viable and maintained over\ntime without interruption or weakening, i.e., the OSS health, users can\nconsider the risk implied by using the OSS as is, and if necessary, decide\nwhether to help improve the health or choose another option. However, such\nassessment is complex as OSS health covers a wide range of sub-topics, and\nexisting support is limited. Aim: We aim to create an overview of\ncharacteristics that affect the health of an OSS project and enable the\nassessment thereof. Method: We conduct a snowball literature review based on a\nstart set of 9 papers, and identify 146 relevant papers over two iterations of\nforward and backward snowballing. Health characteristics are elicited and coded\nusing structured and axial coding into a framework structure. Results: The\nfinal framework consists of 104 health characteristics divided among 15 themes.\nCharacteristics address the socio-technical spectrum of the community of actors\nmaintaining the OSS project, the software and other deliverables being\nmaintained, and the orchestration facilitating the maintenance. Characteristics\nare further divided based on the level of abstraction they address, i.e., the\nOSS project-level specifically, or the project's overarching ecosystem of\nrelated OSS projects. Conclusion: The framework provides an overview of the\nwide span of health characteristics that may need to be considered when\nevaluating OSS health and can serve as a foundation both for research and\npractice.",

Numerous causes of test flakiness have been identified, and program\nanalyses exist to detect such tests. Typically, these methods produce advice to\ndevelopers on how to refactor tests in order to make test outcomes\ndeterministic. We argue that one source of flakiness is the lack of assumptions\nthat precisely describe under which circumstances a test is meaningful. We\ndevise a sanitisation technique that can isolate f laky tests quickly by\ninferring such assumptions on-the-fly, allowing automated builds to proceed as\nflaky tests are ignored. We demonstrate this approach for Java and Groovy\nprograms by implementing it as extensions for three popular testing frameworks\n(JUnit4, JUnit5 and Spock) that can transparently inject the inferred\nassumptions. If JUnit5 is used, those extensions can be deployed without\nrefactoring project source code. We demonstrate and evaluate the utility of our\napproach using a set of six popular real-world programs, addressing known test\nflakiness issues in these programs caused by dependencies of tests on network\navailability.

    "title": "VacciNet: Towards a Smart Framework for Learning the Distribution Chain  Optimization of Vaccines for a Pandemic",
    "abstract": "Vaccinations against viruses have always been the need of the hour since long\npast. However, it is hard to efficiently distribute the vaccines (on time) to\nall the corners of a country, especially during a pandemic. Considering the\nvastness of the population, diversified communities, and demands of a smart\nsociety, it is an important task to optimize the vaccine distribution strategy\nin any country/state effectively. Although there is a profusion of data (Big\nData) from various vaccine administration sites that can be mined to gain\nvaluable insights about mass vaccination drives, very few attempts has been\nmade towards revolutionizing the traditional mass vaccination campaigns to\nmitigate the socio-economic crises of pandemic afflicted countries. In this\npaper, we bridge this gap in studies and experimentation. We collect daily\nvaccination data which is publicly available and carefully analyze it to\ngenerate meaning-full insights and predictions. We put forward a novel\nframework leveraging Supervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) which\nwe call VacciNet, that is capable of learning to predict the demand of\nvaccination in a state of a country as well as suggest optimal vaccine\nallocation in the state for minimum cost of procurement and supply. At the\npresent, our framework is trained and tested with vaccination data of the USA.",

    "abstract": "Recent Deep Learning (DL) advancements in solving complex real-world tasks\nhave led to its widespread adoption in practical applications. However, this\nopportunity comes with significant underlying risks, as many of these models\nrely on privacy-sensitive data for training in a variety of applications,\nmaking them an overly-exposed threat surface for privacy violations.\nFurthermore, the widespread use of cloud-based Machine-Learning-as-a-Service\n(MLaaS) for its robust infrastructure support has broadened the threat surface\nto include a variety of remote side-channel attacks. In this paper, we first\nidentify and report a novel data-dependent timing side-channel leakage (termed\nClass Leakage) in DL implementations originating from non-constant time\nbranching operation in a widely used DL framework PyTorch. We further\ndemonstrate a practical inference-time attack where an adversary with user\nprivilege and hard-label black-box access to an MLaaS can exploit Class Leakage\nto compromise the privacy of MLaaS users. DL models are vulnerable to\nMembership Inference Attack (MIA), where an adversary's objective is to deduce\nwhether any particular data has been used while training the model. In this\npaper, as a separate case study, we demonstrate that a DL model secured with\ndifferential privacy (a popular countermeasure against MIA) is still vulnerable\nto MIA against an adversary exploiting Class Leakage. We develop an\neasy-to-implement countermeasure by making a constant-time branching operation\nthat alleviates the Class Leakage and also aids in mitigating MIA. We have\nchosen two standard benchmarking image classification datasets, CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100 to train five state-of-the-art pre-trained DL models, over two\ndifferent computing environments having Intel Xeon and Intel i7 processors to\nvalidate our approach.",

A low-complexity energy-efficient\nalternating optimization framework is introduced which simultaneously optimizes\nthe transmit power of the source, PAC, and power of the relay node by\nconsidering the quality of service (QoS), power budget, and cooperation\nconstraints under the imperfect SIC decoding. Subsequently, a joint channel\ncoding framework is provided to enhance the performance of far user which has\nno direct communication link with the base station (BS) and has bad channel\nconditions. In the destination node, the far user data is jointly decoded using\na Sum-product algorithm (SPA) based joint iterative decoder realized by\njointly-designed Quasi-cyclic Low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes obtained\nfrom cyclic balanced sampling plans excluding contiguous units (CBSEC).\nSimulation results evince that the proposed BSC-enabled cooperative NOMA system\noutperforms its counterpart by providing an efficient performance in terms of\nenergy efficiency.

    "abstract": "As machine learning (ML) models gain traction in clinical applications,\nunderstanding the impact of clinician and societal biases on ML models is\nincreasingly important. While biases can arise in the labels used for model\ntraining, the many sources from which these biases arise are not yet\nwell-studied. In this paper, we highlight disparate censorship (i.e.,\ndifferences in testing rates across patient groups) as a source of label bias\nthat clinical ML models may amplify, potentially causing harm. Many patient\nrisk-stratification models are trained using the results of clinician-ordered\ndiagnostic and laboratory tests of labels. Patients without test results are\noften assigned a negative label, which assumes that untested patients do not\nexperience the outcome. Since orders are affected by clinical and resource\nconsiderations, testing may not be uniform in patient populations, giving rise\nto disparate censorship. Disparate censorship in patients of equivalent risk\nleads to undertesting in certain groups, and in turn, more biased labels for\nsuch groups. Using such biased labels in standard ML pipelines could contribute\nto gaps in model performance across patient groups. Here, we theoretically and\nempirically characterize conditions in which disparate censorship or\nundertesting affect model performance across subgroups. Our findings call\nattention to disparate censorship as a source of label bias in clinical ML\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "Training deep neural networks is a very demanding task, especially\nchallenging is how to adapt architectures to improve the performance of trained\nmodels. We can find that sometimes, shallow networks generalize better than\ndeep networks, and the addition of more layers results in higher training and\ntest errors. The deep residual learning framework addresses this degradation\nproblem by adding skip connections to several neural network layers. It would\nat first seem counter-intuitive that such skip connections are needed to train\ndeep networks successfully as the expressivity of a network would grow\nexponentially with depth. In this paper, we first analyze the flow of\ninformation through neural networks. We introduce and evaluate the\nbatch-entropy which quantifies the flow of information through each layer of a\nneural network. We prove empirically and theoretically that a positive\nbatch-entropy is required for gradient descent-based training approaches to\noptimize a given loss function successfully. Based on those insights, we\nintroduce batch-entropy regularization to enable gradient descent-based\ntraining algorithms to optimize the flow of information through each hidden\nlayer individually. With batch-entropy regularization, gradient descent\noptimizers can transform untrainable networks into trainable networks. We show\nempirically that we can therefore train a \"vanilla\" fully connected network and\nconvolutional neural network -- no skip connections, batch normalization,\ndropout, or any other architectural tweak -- with 500 layers by simply adding\nthe batch-entropy regularization term to the loss function. The effect of\nbatch-entropy regularization is not only evaluated on vanilla neural networks,\nbut also on residual networks, autoencoders, and also transformer models over a\nwide range of computer vision as well as natural language processing tasks.",

To evaluate the capabilities of the framework, we\nused a cluster with Fujitsu CPUs and heterogeneous cluster with Intel CPUs and\nBlueField-2 DPUs interconnected using high-performance RDMA fabric. We\ndemonstrated an X-RDMA pointer chase application that outperforms an RDMA\nGET-based implementation by 70% and is as fast as Active Messages, but does not\nrequire function predeployment on remote platforms.",

    "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) services are ubiquitous, transforming\nspeech into text for systems like Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant, and\nMicrosoft's Cortana. However, researchers have identified biases in ASR\nperformance between particular English language accents by racial group and by\nnationality. In this paper, we expand this discussion both qualitatively by\nrelating it to historical precedent and quantitatively through a large-scale\naudit. Standardization of language and the use of language to maintain global\nand political power have played an important role in history, which we explain\nto show the parallels in the ways in which ASR services act on English language\nspeakers today. Then, using a large and global data set of speech from The\nSpeech Accent Archive which includes over 2,700 speakers of English born in 171\ndifferent countries, we perform an international audit of some of the most\npopular English ASR services. We show that performance disparities exist as a\nfunction of whether or not a speaker's first language is English and, even when\ncontrolling for multiple linguistic covariates, that these disparities have a\nstatistically significant relationship to the political alignment of the\nspeaker's birth country with respect to the United States' geopolitical power.",

    "abstract": "Movement synchrony reflects the coordination of body movements between\ninteracting dyads. The estimation of movement synchrony has been automated by\npowerful deep learning models such as transformer networks. However, instead of\ndesigning a specialized network for movement synchrony estimation, previous\ntransformer-based works broadly adopted architectures from other tasks such as\nhuman activity recognition. Therefore, this paper proposed a skeleton-based\ngraph transformer for movement synchrony estimation. The proposed model applied\nST-GCN, a spatial-temporal graph convolutional neural network for skeleton\nfeature extraction, followed by a spatial transformer for spatial feature\ngeneration. The spatial transformer is guided by a uniquely designed joint\nposition embedding shared between the same joints of interacting individuals.\nBesides, we incorporated a temporal similarity matrix in temporal attention\ncomputation considering the periodic intrinsic of body movements. In addition,\nthe confidence score associated with each joint reflects the uncertainty of a\npose, while previous works on movement synchrony estimation have not\nsufficiently emphasized this point. Since transformer networks demand a\nsignificant amount of data to train, we constructed a dataset for movement\nsynchrony estimation using Human3.6M, a benchmark dataset for human activity\nrecognition, and pretrained our model on it using contrastive learning. We\nfurther applied knowledge distillation to alleviate information loss introduced\nby pose detector failure in a privacy-preserving way. We compared our method\nwith representative approaches on PT13, a dataset collected from autism therapy\ninterventions. Our method achieved an overall accuracy of 88.98% and surpassed\nits counterparts by a wide margin while maintaining data privacy.",

    "abstract": "Estimating 6D poses of objects is an essential computer vision task. However,\nmost conventional approaches rely on camera data from a single perspective and\ntherefore suffer from occlusions. We overcome this issue with our novel\nmulti-view 6D pose estimation method called MV6D which accurately predicts the\n6D poses of all objects in a cluttered scene based on RGB-D images from\nmultiple perspectives. We base our approach on the PVN3D network that uses a\nsingle RGB-D image to predict keypoints of the target objects. We extend this\napproach by using a combined point cloud from multiple views and fusing the\nimages from each view with a DenseFusion layer. In contrast to current\nmulti-view pose detection networks such as CosyPose, our MV6D can learn the\nfusion of multiple perspectives in an end-to-end manner and does not require\nmultiple prediction stages or subsequent fine tuning of the prediction.\nFurthermore, we present three novel photorealistic datasets of cluttered scenes\nwith heavy occlusions. All of them contain RGB-D images from multiple\nperspectives and the ground truth for instance semantic segmentation and 6D\npose estimation. MV6D significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in\nmulti-view 6D pose estimation even in cases where the camera poses are known\ninaccurately.

Most UDA approaches align features within a common\nembedding space and apply a shared classifier for target prediction.

Recent work\nin distribution testing has shown that many algorithms are robust in the sense\nthat they still produce correct output if the elements are drawn from any\ndistribution $Q$ that is sufficiently close to $P$. This phenomenon raises\ninteresting questions: under what conditions is a \"noisy\" distribution $Q$\nsufficient, and what is the algorithmic cost of coping with this noise?\nWe investigate these questions for the problem of estimating the sum of a\nmultiset of $N$ real values $x_1, \\ldots, x_N$. This problem is well-studied in\nthe statistical literature in the case $P = Q$, where the Hansen-Hurwitz\nestimator is frequently used. We assume that for some known distribution $P$,\nvalues are sampled from a distribution $Q$ that is pointwise close to $P$. For\nevery positive integer $k$ we define an estimator $\\zeta_k$ for $\\mu = \\sum_i\nx_i$ whose bias is proportional to $\\gamma^k$ (where our $\\zeta_1$ reduces to\nthe classical Hansen-Hurwitz estimator). As a special case, we show that if $Q$\nis pointwise $\\gamma$-close to uniform and all $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, for any\n$\\epsilon > 0$, we can estimate $\\mu$ to within additive error $\\epsilon N$\nusing $m = \\Theta({N^{1-\\frac{1}{k}} / \\epsilon^{2/k}})$ samples, where $k =\n\\left\\lceil (\\log \\epsilon)/(\\log \\gamma)\\right\\rceil$. We show that this\nsample complexity is essentially optimal. Our bounds show that the sample\ncomplexity need not vary uniformly with the desired error parameter $\\epsilon$:\nfor some values of $\\epsilon$, perturbations in its value have no asymptotic\neffect on the sample complexity, while for other values, any decrease in its\nvalue results in an asymptotically larger sample complexity.",

    "title": "Late Fusion Multi-view Clustering via Global and Local Alignment  Maximization",
    "abstract": "Multi-view clustering (MVC) optimally integrates complementary information\nfrom different views to improve clustering performance. Although demonstrating\npromising performance in various applications, most of existing approaches\ndirectly fuse multiple pre-specified similarities to learn an optimal\nsimilarity matrix for clustering, which could cause over-complicated\noptimization and intensive computational cost. In this paper, we propose late\nfusion MVC via alignment maximization to address these issues. To do so, we\nfirst reveal the theoretical connection of existing k-means clustering and the\nalignment between base partitions and the consensus one. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a simple but effective multi-view algorithm termed\nLF-MVC-GAM. It optimally fuses multiple source information in partition level\nfrom each individual view, and maximally aligns the consensus partition with\nthese weighted base ones. Such an alignment is beneficial to integrate\npartition level information and significantly reduce the computational\ncomplexity by sufficiently simplifying the optimization procedure. We then\ndesign another variant, LF-MVC-LAM to further improve the clustering\nperformance by preserving the local intrinsic structure among multiple\npartition spaces. After that, we develop two three-step iterative algorithms to\nsolve the resultant optimization problems with theoretically guaranteed\nconvergence. Further, we provide the generalization error bound analysis of the\nproposed algorithms. Extensive experiments on eighteen multi-view benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed\nLF-MVC-GAM and LF-MVC-LAM, ranging from small to large-scale data items. The\ncodes of the proposed algorithms are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/wangsiwei2010/latefusionalignment.",

    "abstract": "The surge in interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) over the past decade\nhas been driven almost exclusively by advances in Artificial Neural Networks\n(ANNs). While ANNs set state-of-the-art performance for many previously\nintractable problems, they require large amounts of data and computational\nresources for training, and since they employ supervised learning they\ntypically need to know the correctly labelled response for every training\nexample, limiting their scalability for real-world domains. Spiking Neural\nNetworks (SNNs) are an alternative to ANNs that use more brain-like artificial\nneurons and can use unsupervised learning to discover recognizable features in\nthe input data without knowing correct responses. SNNs, however, struggle with\ndynamical stability and cannot match the accuracy of ANNs. Here we show how an\nSNN can overcome many of the shortcomings that have been identified in the\nliterature, including offering a principled solution to the vanishing spike\nproblem, to outperform all existing shallow SNNs and equal the performance of\nan ANN. It accomplishes this while using unsupervised learning with unlabeled\ndata and only 1/50th of the training epochs (labelled data is used only for a\nfinal simple linear readout layer). This result makes SNNs a viable new method\nfor fast, accurate, efficient, explainable, and re-deployable machine learning\nwith unlabeled datasets.",

The fact that it is a memory-based method, i.e., it\nuses the entire training data set for prediction, makes it unsuitable for most\ncurrent big data applications. Several strategies, such as tree-based or\nhashing-based estimators, have been proposed to improve the efficiency of the\nkernel density estimation method.

    "abstract": "Recently, pioneer research works have proposed a large number of acoustic\nfeatures (log power spectrogram, linear frequency cepstral coefficients,\nconstant Q cepstral coefficients, etc.) for audio deepfake detection, obtaining\ngood performance, and showing that different subbands have different\ncontributions to audio deepfake detection. However, this lacks an explanation\nof the specific information in the subband, and these features also lose\ninformation such as phase. Inspired by the mechanism of synthetic speech, the\nfundamental frequency (F0) information is used to improve the quality of\nsynthetic speech, while the F0 of synthetic speech is still too average, which\ndiffers significantly from that of real speech. It is expected that F0 can be\nused as important information to discriminate between bonafide and fake speech,\nwhile this information cannot be used directly due to the irregular\ndistribution of F0. Insteadly, the frequency band containing most of F0 is\nselected as the input feature. Meanwhile, to make full use of the phase and\nfull-band information, we also propose to use real and imaginary spectrogram\nfeatures as complementary input features and model the disjoint subbands\nseparately. Finally, the results of F0, real and imaginary spectrogram features\nare fused. Experimental results on the ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset show that our\nproposed system is very effective for the audio deepfake detection task,\nachieving an equivalent error rate (EER) of 0.43%, which surpasses almost all\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, network and system administrators are responsible for\ndesigning, configuring, and resolving the Internet service requests.\nHuman-driven system configuration and management are proving unsatisfactory due\nto the recent interest in time-sensitive applications with stringent quality of\nservice (QoS). Aiming to transition from the traditional human-driven to\nzero-touch service management in the field of networks and computing,\nintent-driven service management (IDSM) has been proposed as a response to\nstringent quality of service requirements. In IDSM, users express their service\nrequirements in a declarative manner as intents. IDSM, with the help of closed\ncontrol-loop operations, perform configurations and deployments, autonomously\nto meet service request requirements. The result is a faster deployment of\nInternet services and reduction in configuration errors caused by manual\noperations, which in turn reduces the service-level agreement (SLA) violations.\nIn the early stages of development, IDSM systems require attention from\nindustry as well as academia. In an attempt to fill the gaps in current\nresearch, we conducted a systematic literature review of SLA management in IDSM\nsystems.

    "abstract": "The vehicular edge computing (VEC) can cache contents in different RSUs at\nthe network edge to support the real-time vehicular applications. In VEC, owing\nto the high-mobility characteristics of vehicles, it is necessary to cache the\nuser data in advance and learn the most popular and interesting contents for\nvehicular users. Since user data usually contains privacy information, users\nare reluctant to share their data with others. To solve this problem,\ntraditional federated learning (FL) needs to update the global model\nsynchronously through aggregating all users' local models to protect users'\nprivacy. However, vehicles may frequently drive out of the coverage area of the\nVEC before they achieve their local model trainings and thus the local models\ncannot be uploaded as expected, which would reduce the accuracy of the global\nmodel. In addition, the caching capacity of the local RSU is limited and the\npopular contents are diverse, thus the size of the predicted popular contents\nusually exceeds the cache capacity of the local RSU. Hence, the VEC should\ncache the predicted popular contents in different RSUs while considering the\ncontent transmission delay. In this paper, we consider the mobility of vehicles\nand propose a cooperative Caching scheme in the VEC based on Asynchronous\nFederated and deep Reinforcement learning (CAFR). We first consider the\nmobility of vehicles and propose an asynchronous FL algorithm to obtain an\naccurate global model, and then propose an algorithm to predict the popular\ncontents based on the global model. In addition, we consider the mobility of\nvehicles and propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to obtain the\noptimal cooperative caching location for the predicted popular contents in\norder to optimize the content transmission delay. Extensive experimental\nresults have demonstrated that the CAFR scheme outperforms other baseline\ncaching schemes.",

In this work, we propose using deep\nreinforcement learning to generate analytical dashboards that can use\nwell-established visualization knowledge and the estimation capacity of\nreinforcement learning. Specifically, we use visualization knowledge to\nconstruct a training environment and rewards for agents to explore and imitate\nhuman exploration behavior with a well-designed agent network. The usefulness\nof the deep reinforcement learning model is demonstrated through ablation\nstudies and user studies. In conclusion, our work opens up new opportunities to\ndevelop effective ML-based visualization recommenders without beforehand\ntraining datasets.",

    "abstract": "Floods are one of nature's most catastrophic calamities which cause\nirreversible and immense damage to human life, agriculture, infrastructure and\nsocio-economic system. Several studies on flood catastrophe management and\nflood forecasting systems have been conducted. The accurate prediction of the\nonset and progression of floods in real time is challenging. To estimate water\nlevels and velocities across a large area, it is necessary to combine data with\ncomputationally demanding flood propagation models. This paper aims to reduce\nthe extreme risks of this natural disaster and also contributes to policy\nsuggestions by providing a prediction for floods using different machine\nlearning models. This research will use Binary Logistic Regression, K-Nearest\nNeighbor (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Decision tree Classifier to\nprovide an accurate prediction. With the outcome, a comparative analysis will\nbe conducted to understand which model delivers a better accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is a promising technology to support real-time\napplications through caching the contents in the roadside units (RSUs), thus\nvehicles can fetch the contents requested by vehicular users (VUs) from the RSU\nwithin short time. The capacity of the RSU is limited and the contents\nrequested by VUs change frequently due to the high-mobility characteristics of\nvehicles, thus it is essential to predict the most popular contents and cache\nthem in the RSU in advance. The RSU can train model based on the VUs' data to\neffectively predict the popular contents. However, VUs are often reluctant to\nshare their data with others due to the personal privacy. Federated learning\n(FL) allows each vehicle to train the local model based on VUs' data, and\nupload the local model to the RSU instead of data to update the global model,\nand thus VUs' privacy information can be protected. The traditional synchronous\nFL must wait all vehicles to complete training and upload their local models\nfor global model updating, which would cause a long time to train global model.\nThe asynchronous FL updates the global model in time once a vehicle's local\nmodel is received. However, the vehicles with different staying time have\ndifferent impacts to achieve the accurate global model. In this paper, we\nconsider the vehicle mobility and propose an Asynchronous FL based\nMobility-aware Edge Caching (AFMC) scheme to obtain an accurate global model,\nand then propose an algorithm to predict the popular contents based on the\nglobal model. Experimental results show that AFMC outperforms other baseline\ncaching schemes.",

A reduced-order method for the dynamic analysis of sliding rings\non a deformable one-dimensional (1D) rod-like object is proposed. In contrast\nto discretize the joint rings into multiple nodes and edges for contact\ndetection and numerical simulation, a single point is used to reduce the order\nof the numerical model. In order to achieve the non-deviation condition between\nsliding ring and flexible rod, a novel barrier functional is derived based on\nincremental potential theory, and the tangent frictional interplay is later\nprocured by a lagged dissipative formulation. The proposed barrier functional\nand the associated frictional functional are $C^{2}$ continuous, hence the\nnonlinear elastodynamic system can be solved variationally by an implicit\ntime-stepping scheme. The numerical framework is first applied to simple\nexamples where the analytical solutions are available for validation.

Adequate mitigation of\nsecurity weaknesses in Puppet manifests is thus necessary to secure computing\ninfrastructure that are managed with Puppet manifests. A characterization of\nhow security weaknesses propagate and affect Puppet-based infrastructure\nmanagement, can inform practitioners on the relevance of the detected security\nweaknesses, as well as help them take necessary actions for mitigation. To that\nend, we conduct an empirical study with 17,629 Puppet manifests mined from 336\nopen source repositories.

TaintPup leverages\nPuppet-specific information flow analysis using which we characterize\npropagation of security weaknesses. From our empirical study, we observe\nsecurity weaknesses to propagate into 4,457 resources, i.e, Puppet-specific\ncode elements used to manage infrastructure. A single instance of a security\nweakness can propagate into as many as 35 distinct resources. We observe\nsecurity weaknesses to propagate into 7 categories of resources, which include\nresources used to manage continuous integration servers and network\ncontrollers.

Individuals with severe motor and speech disabilities\nprimarily rely on gaze input for communication. Gaze input also serves as a\nhands-free input modality in the scenarios of situationally-induced impairments\nand disabilities (SIIDs). Hence, the performance of gaze input has often been\ncompared to mouse input through standardized performance evaluation procedure\nlike the Fitts' Law. With the proliferation of touch-enabled devices such as\nsmartphones, tablet PCs, or any computing device with a touch surface, it is\nalso important to compare the performance of gaze input to touch input.\nIn this study, we conducted ISO 9241-9 Fitts' Law evaluation to compare the\nperformance of multimodal gaze and foot-based input to touch input in a\nstandard desktop environment, while using mouse input as the baseline. From a\nstudy involving 12 participants, we found that the gaze input has the lowest\nthroughput (2.55 bits/s), and the highest movement time (1.04 s) of the three\ninputs. In addition, though touch input involves maximum physical movements, it\nachieved the highest throughput (6.67 bits/s), the least movement time (0.5 s),\nand was the most preferred input. While there are similarities in how quickly\npointing can be moved from source to target location when using both gaze and\ntouch inputs, target selection consumes maximum time with gaze input.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation of images involve\ncomputationally intensive neural network architectures. Most of these methods\nare not adaptable to high-resolution image segmentation due to memory and other\ncomputational issues. Typical approaches in literature involve design of neural\nnetwork architectures that can fuse global information from low-resolution\nimages and local information from the high-resolution counterparts. However,\narchitectures designed for processing high resolution images are unnecessarily\ncomplex and involve a lot of hyper parameters that can be difficult to tune.\nAlso, most of these architectures require ground truth annotations of the high\nresolution images to train, which can be hard to obtain. In this article, we\ndevelop a robust pipeline based on mathematical morphological (MM) operators\nthat can seamlessly extend any existing semantic segmentation algorithm to high\nresolution images. Our method does not require the ground truth annotations of\nthe high resolution images. It is based on efficiently utilizing information\nfrom the low-resolution counterparts, and gradient information on the\nhigh-resolution images. We obtain high quality seeds from the inferred labels\non low-resolution images using traditional morphological operators and\npropagate seed labels using a random walker to refine the semantic labels at\nthe boundaries. We show that the semantic segmentation results obtained by our\nmethod beat the existing state-of-the-art algorithms on high-resolution images.\nWe empirically prove the robustness of our approach to the hyper parameters\nused in our pipeline.

While the\nclassical Bond-Based PD (BB-PD) considers only the stretch of bonds, all\ncomponents of the bonds' strains are taken into account in the proposed model.A\nlocal imaginary element is considered around each bond to estimate the true\nstrains of each bond. The constitutive relations are derived from equating the\nstrain energies of the bonds' deformations to the Classical Continuum Mechanics\n(CCM) strain energies for a generalized combined loading condition. A novel\ncritical stretch criterion and critical angle criterion are proposed to predict\nthe failure of normal and shear strain bonds, respectively.It is also shown\nthat, unlike the classical BB-PD, the proposed model does not impose any\nlimitations on the value of Poisson's ratio.

Therefore, reinitialization\nor redistancing methods are frequently applied to restore the signed distance\nproperty while keeping the zero-contour fixed. As an alternative approach to\nthese methods, we introduce a novel level set advection equation that\nintrinsically preserves the norm of the gradient at the interface, i.e. the\nlocal signed distance property. Mathematically, this is achieved by introducing\na source term that is proportional to the local rate of interfacial area\ngeneration. The introduction of the source term turns the problem into a\nnon-linear one. However, we show that by discretizing the source term\nexplicitly in time, it is sufficient to solve a linear equation in each time\nstep. Notably, without adjustment, the method works naturally in the case of a\nmoving contact line. This is a major advantage since redistancing is known to\nbe an issue when contact lines are involved (see, e.g., Della Rocca and\nBlanquart, 2014).

    "title": "Automatic Classification of Bug Reports Based on Multiple Text  Information and Reports' Intention",
    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of software scale and complexity, a large number of bug\nreports are submitted to the bug tracking system. In order to speed up defect\nrepair, these reports need to be accurately classified so that they can be sent\nto the appropriate developers. However, the existing classification methods\nonly use the text information of the bug report, which leads to their low\nperformance. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new automatic\nclassification method for bug reports. The innovation is that when categorizing\nbug reports, in addition to using the text information of the report, the\nintention of the report (i.e. suggestion or explanation) is also considered,\nthereby improving the performance of the classification. First, we collect bug\nreports from four ecosystems (Apache, Eclipse, Gentoo, Mozilla) and manually\nannotate them to construct an experimental data set. Then, we use Natural\nLanguage Processing technology to preprocess the data. On this basis, BERT and\nTF-IDF are used to extract the features of the intention and the multiple text\ninformation. Finally, the features are used to train the classifiers. The\nexperimental result on five classifiers (including K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive\nBayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest) show\nthat our proposed method achieves better performance and its F-Measure achieves\nfrom 87.3% to 95.5%.",

A deep\nlearning segmentation of the pins is performed and the inspection pose is found\nby simulation. From the inspection pose and the segmented pins, the templates\nfor pose estimation and pin check are then generated. To train the deep\nlearning method a dataset of segmented through-hole components is created. The\nnetwork shows a 97.3 % accuracy on the test set.

    "abstract": "Reducing energy consumption is crucial to reduce the human debt's with regard\nto our planet. Therefore most companies try to reduce their energetic\nconsumption while taking care to preserve the service delivered to their\ncustomers. To do so, a service provider (SP) typically downscale or shutdown\npart of its infrastructure in periods of low-activity where only few customers\nneed the service. However an SP still needs to maintain part of its\ninfrastructure \"on\", which still requires significant energy. For example a\nmobile national operator (MNO) needs to maintain most of its radio access\nnetwork (RAN) active. Could an SP do better by cooperating with other SPs who\nwould temporarily support its users, thus allowing it to temporarily shut down\nits infrastructure, and then reciprocate during another low-activity period? To\nanswer this question, we investigated a novel collaboration framework based on\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) allowing negotiations between SPs as\nwell as trustful reports from a distributed ledger technology (DLT) to evaluate\nthe amount of energy being saved. We leveraged it to experiment three different\nsets of rules (free, recommended, or imposed) regulating the negotiation\nbetween multiple SPs (3, 4, 8, or 10). With respect to four cooperation metrics\n(efficiency, safety, incentive-compatibility, and fairness), the simulations\nshowed that the imposed set of rules proved to be the best mode.",

To achieve this goal, we propose a novel approach called\nMultiview Regenerative Morphing that formulates the morphing process as an\noptimization to solve for rigid transformation and optimal-transport\ninterpolation. Given the multiview input images of the source and target\nscenes, we first learn a volumetric representation that models the geometry and\nappearance for each scene to enable the rendering of novel views. Then, the\nmorphing between the two scenes is obtained by solving optimal transport\nbetween the two volumetric representations in Wasserstein metrics. Our approach\ndoes not rely on user-specified correspondences or 2D/3D input meshes, and we\ndo not assume any predefined categories of the source and target scenes.

    "abstract": "This paper is dedicated to control theoretically explainable application of\nautoencoders to optimal fault detection in nonlinear dynamic systems.\nAutoencoder-based learning is a standard method of machine learning technique\nand widely applied for fault (anomaly) detection and classification. In the\ncontext of representation learning, the so-called latent (hidden) variable\nplays an important role towards an optimal fault detection. In ideal case, the\nlatent variable should be a minimal sufficient statistic. The existing\nautoencoder-based fault detection schemes are mainly application-oriented, and\nfew efforts have been devoted to optimal autoencoder-based fault detection and\nexplainable applications. The main objective of our work is to establish a\nframework for learning autoencoder-based optimal fault detection in nonlinear\ndynamic systems. To this aim, a process model form for dynamic systems is\nfirstly introduced with the aid of control and system theory, which also leads\nto a clear system interpretation of the latent variable. The major efforts are\ndevoted to the development of a control theoretical solution to the optimal\nfault detection problem, in which an analog concept to minimal sufficient\nstatistic, the so-called lossless information compression, is introduced for\ndynamic systems and fault detection specifications. In particular, the\nexistence conditions for such a latent variable are derived, based on which a\nloss function and further a learning algorithm are developed. This learning\nalgorithm enables optimally training of autoencoders to achieve an optimal\nfault detection in nonlinear dynamic systems. A case study on three-tank system\nis given at the end of this paper to illustrate the capability of the proposed\nautoencoder-based fault detection and to explain the essential role of the\nlatent variable in the proposed fault detection system.",

Unlike traditional feature\nselection methods, the class-specific feature selection methods select an\noptimal feature subset for each class. Typically class-specific feature\nselection (CSFS) methods use one-versus-all split of the data set that leads to\nissues such as class imbalance, decision aggregation, and high computational\noverhead. We propose a class-specific feature selection method embedded in a\nfuzzy rule-based classifier, which is free from the drawbacks associated with\nmost existing class-specific methods. Additionally, our method can be adapted\nto control the level of redundancy in the class-specific feature subsets by\nadding a suitable regularizer to the learning objective. Our method results in\nclass-specific rules involving class-specific subsets. We also propose an\nextension where different rules of a particular class are defined by different\nfeature subsets to model different substructures within the class.

In this paper, we present a new prediction pattern, which introduces\npreviously overlooked human poses, to implement the prediction task from the\nview of interpolation. These poses exist after the predicted sequence, and form\nthe privileged sequence. To be specific, we first propose an InTerPolation\nlearning Network (ITP-Network) that encodes both the observed sequence and the\nprivileged sequence to interpolate the in-between predicted sequence, wherein\nthe embedded Privileged-sequence-Encoder (Priv-Encoder) learns the privileged\nknowledge (PK) simultaneously. Then, we propose a Final Prediction Network\n(FP-Network) for which the privileged sequence is not observable, but is\nequipped with a novel PK-Simulator that distills PK learned from the previous\nnetwork. This simulator takes as input the observed sequence, but approximates\nthe behavior of Priv-Encoder, enabling FP-Network to imitate the interpolation\nprocess.

    "abstract": "Solid results from Transformers have made them prevailing architectures in\nvarious natural language and vision tasks. As a default component in\nTransformers, Layer Normalization (LN) normalizes activations within each token\nto boost the robustness. However, LN requires on-the-fly statistics calculation\nin inference as well as division and square root operations, leading to\ninefficiency on hardware. What is more, replacing LN with other\nhardware-efficient normalization schemes (e.g., Batch Normalization) results in\ninferior performance, even collapse in training. We find that this dilemma is\ncaused by abnormal behaviors of activation statistics, including large\nfluctuations over iterations and extreme outliers across layers. To tackle\nthese issues, we propose Unified Normalization (UN), which can speed up the\ninference by being fused with other linear operations and achieve comparable\nperformance on par with LN. UN strives to boost performance by calibrating the\nactivation and gradient statistics with a tailored fluctuation smoothing\nstrategy. Meanwhile, an adaptive outlier filtration strategy is applied to\navoid collapse in training whose effectiveness is theoretically proved and\nexperimentally verified in this paper. We demonstrate that UN can be an\nefficient drop-in alternative to LN by conducting extensive experiments on\nlanguage and vision tasks. Besides, we evaluate the efficiency of our method on\nGPU.

Experimental\nresults on the BioCreative-V Track 4 corpus show that our joint learning model\noutperforms the separate models in BEL statement extraction, achieving the F1\nscores of 58.4% and 37.3% on the test set in Stage 2 and Stage 1 evaluations,\nrespectively. This demonstrates that our joint learning system reaches the\nstate-of-the-art performance in Stage 2 compared with other systems.",

    "abstract": "[Background] In large open-source software projects, development knowledge is\noften fragmented across multiple artefacts and contributors such that\nindividual stakeholders are generally unaware of the full breadth of the\nproduct features. However, users want to know what the software is capable of,\nwhile contributors need to know where to fix, update, and add features.\n[Objective] This work aims at understanding how feature knowledge is documented\nin GitHub projects and how it is linked (if at all) to the source code.\n[Method] We conducted an in-depth qualitative exploratory content analysis of\n25 popular GitHub repositories that provided the documentation artefacts\nrecommended by GitHub's Community Standards indicator. We first extracted\nstrategies used to document software features in textual artefacts and then\nstrategies used to link the feature documentation with source code. [Results]\nWe observed feature documentation in all studied projects in artefacts such as\nREADMEs, wikis, and website resource files. However, the features were often\ndescribed in an unstructured way. Additionally, tracing techniques to connect\nfeature documentation and source code were rarely used. [Conclusions] Our\nresults suggest a lacking (or a low-prioritised) feature documentation in\nopen-source projects, little use of normalised structures, and a rare explicit\nreferencing to source code. As a result, product feature traceability is likely\nto be very limited, and maintainability to suffer over time.",

    "abstract": "Electronic Health Records (EHRs) exhibit a high amount of missing data due to\nvariations of patient conditions and treatment needs. Imputation of missing\nvalues has been considered an effective approach to deal with this challenge.\nExisting work separates imputation method and prediction model as two\nindependent parts of an EHR-based machine learning system. We propose an\nintegrated end-to-end approach by utilizing a Compound Density Network (CDNet)\nthat allows the imputation method and prediction model to be tuned together\nwithin a single framework. CDNet consists of a Gated recurrent unit (GRU), a\nMixture Density Network (MDN), and a Regularized Attention Network (RAN). The\nGRU is used as a latent variable model to model EHR data. The MDN is designed\nto sample latent variables generated by GRU. The RAN serves as a regularizer\nfor less reliable imputed values. The architecture of CDNet enables GRU and MDN\nto iteratively leverage the output of each other to impute missing values,\nleading to a more accurate and robust prediction. We validate CDNet on the\nmortality prediction task on the MIMIC-III dataset. Our model outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models by significant margins. We also empirically show that\nregularizing imputed values is a key factor for superior prediction\nperformance. Analysis of prediction uncertainty shows that our model can\ncapture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, which offers model users a\nbetter understanding of the model results.",

    "abstract": "Mocking in the context of automated software tests allows testing program\nunits in isolation. Designing realistic interactions between a unit and its\nenvironment, and understanding the expected impact of these interactions on the\nbehavior of the unit, are two key challenges that software testers face when\ndeveloping tests with mocks. In this paper, we propose to monitor an\napplication in production to generate tests that mimic realistic execution\nscenarios through mocks. Our approach operates in three phases. First, we\ninstrument a set of target methods for which we want to generate tests, as well\nas the methods that they invoke, which we refer to mockable method calls.\nSecond, in production, we collect data about the context in which target\nmethods are invoked, as well as the parameters and the returned value for each\nmockable method call. Third, offline, we analyze the production data to\ngenerate test cases with realistic inputs and mock interactions. The approach\nis automated and implemented in an open-source tool called RICK. We evaluate\nour approach with three real-world, open-source Java applications. RICK\nmonitors the invocation of 128 methods in production across the three\napplications and captures their behavior. Next, RICK analyzes the production\nobservations in order to generate test cases that include rich initial states\nand test inputs, mocks and stubs that recreate actual interactions between the\nmethod and its environment, as well as mock-based oracles. All the test cases\nare executable, and 52.4% of them successfully mimic the complete execution\ncontext of the target methods observed in production. We interview 5 developers\nfrom the industry who confirm the relevance of using production observations to\ndesign mocks and stubs.",

To address these challenges,\nwe propose a method for predicting high- and low-risk terrains from only past\nvehicle experience in a self-supervised fashion.

When distributed learning is run over a set\nof wireless connected devices, random channel fluctuations, and the incumbent\nservices simultaneously running on the same network affect the performance of\ndistributed learning. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between\ndistributed AI workflow and ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC)\nservices running concurrently over a network. Using 3GPP compliant simulations\nin a factory automation use case, we show the impact of various distributed AI\nsettings (e.g., model size and the number of participating devices) on the\nconvergence time of distributed AI and the application layer performance of\nURLLC. Unless we leverage the existing 5G-NR quality of service handling\nmechanisms to separate the traffic from the two services, our simulation\nresults show that the impact of distributed AI on the availability of the URLLC\ndevices is significant. Moreover, with proper setting of distributed AI (e.g.,\nproper user selection), we can substantially reduce network resource\nutilization, leading to lower latency for distributed AI and higher\navailability for the URLLC users.

    "abstract": "Fault injection (FI) is a powerful attack methodology allowing an adversary\nto entirely break the security of a target device. As finite-state machines\n(FSMs) are fundamental hardware building blocks responsible for controlling\nsystems, inducing faults into these controllers enables an adversary to hijack\nthe execution of the integrated circuit. A common defense strategy mitigating\nthese attacks is to manually instantiate FSMs multiple times and detect faults\nusing a majority voting logic. However, as each additional FSM instance only\nprovides security against one additional induced fault, this approach scales\npoorly in a multi-fault attack scenario.\nIn this paper, we present SCFI: a strong, probabilistic FSM protection\nmechanism ensuring that control-flow deviations from the intended control-flow\nare detected even in the presence of multiple faults. At its core, SCFI\nconsists of a hardened next-state function absorbing the execution history as\nwell as the FSM's control signals to derive the next state. When either the\nabsorbed inputs, the state registers, or the function itself are affected by\nfaults, SCFI triggers an error with no detection latency. We integrate SCFI\ninto a synthesis tool capable of automatically hardening arbitrary unprotected\nFSMs without user interaction and open-source the tool. Our evaluation shows\nthat SCFI provides strong protection guarantees with a better area-time product\nthan FSMs protected using classical redundancy-based approaches. Finally, we\nformally verify the resilience of the protected state machines using a\npre-silicon fault analysis tool.",

While much of the existing work focuses on aggregate human behavior,\nan important long-range goal is to develop behavioral models that specialize to\nindividual people and can differentiate among them.\nTo formalize this process, we study the problem of behavioral stylometry, in\nwhich the task is to identify a decision-maker from their decisions alone. We\npresent a transformer-based approach to behavioral stylometry in the context of\nchess, where one attempts to identify the player who played a set of games. Our\nmethod operates in a few-shot classification framework, and can correctly\nidentify a player from among thousands of candidate players with 98% accuracy\ngiven only 100 labeled games. Even when trained on amateur play, our method\ngeneralises to out-of-distribution samples of Grandmaster players, despite the\ndramatic differences between amateur and world-class players. Finally, we\nconsider more broadly what our resulting embeddings reveal about human style in\nchess, as well as the potential ethical implications of powerful methods for\nidentifying individuals from behavioral data.",

However, the absence of a unified framework in the present ABSA research\nmakes it challenging to compare different models' performance fairly.\nTherefore, we created an open-source ABSA framework, namely PYABSA. Besides,\nprevious efforts usually neglect the precursor aspect term extraction (ASC)\nsubtask and focus on the aspect sentiment classification (ATE) subtask.\nCompared to previous works, PYABSA includes the features of aspect term\nextraction, aspect sentiment classification, and text classification, while\nmultiple ABSA subtasks can be adapted to PYABSA owing to its modular\narchitecture. To facilitate ABSA applications, PYABSAseamless integrates\nmultilingual modelling, automated dataset annotation, etc., which are helpful\nin deploying ABSA services. In ASC and ATE, PYABSA provides up to 33 and 7\nbuilt-in models, respectively, while all the models provide quick training and\ninstant inference.

Given the\ncomplexity of capturing the line of reasoning from question to the answer or\nfrom claim to premises, the issue arises of how to assist the user in\nefficiently constructing multi--level entailment trees given a large set of\navailable facts. In this paper, we frame the construction of entailment trees\nas a sequence of active premise selection steps, i.e., for each intermediate\nnode in an explanation tree, the expert needs to annotate positive and negative\nexamples of premise facts from a large candidate list. We then iteratively\nfine--tune pre--trained Transformer models with the resulting positive and\ntightly controlled negative samples and aim to balance the encoding of semantic\nrelationships and explanatory entailment relationships.

    "abstract": "Existing gait recognition methods either directly establish Global Feature\nRepresentation (GFR) from original gait sequences or generate Local Feature\nRepresentation (LFR) from several local parts. However, GFR tends to neglect\nlocal details of human postures as the receptive fields become larger in the\ndeeper network layers. Although LFR allows the network to focus on the detailed\nposture information of each local region, it neglects the relations among\ndifferent local parts and thus only exploits limited local information of\nseveral specific regions. To solve these issues, we propose a global-local\nbased gait recognition network, named GaitGL, to generate more discriminative\nfeature representations. To be specific, a novel Global and Local Convolutional\nLayer (GLCL) is developed to take full advantage of both global visual\ninformation and local region details in each layer. GLCL is a dual-branch\nstructure that consists of a GFR extractor and a mask-based LFR extractor. GFR\nextractor aims to extract contextual information, e.g., the relationship among\nvarious body parts, and the mask-based LFR extractor is presented to exploit\nthe detailed posture changes of local regions. In addition, we introduce a\nnovel mask-based strategy to improve the local feature extraction capability.\nSpecifically, we design pairs of complementary masks to randomly occlude\nfeature maps, and then train our mask-based LFR extractor on various occluded\nfeature maps. In this manner, the LFR extractor will learn to fully exploit\nlocal information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaitGL achieves\nbetter performance than state-of-the-art gait recognition methods. The average\nrank-1 accuracy on CASIA-B, OU-MVLP, GREW and Gait3D is 93.6%, 98.7%, 68.0% and\n63.8%, respectively, significantly outperforming the competing methods.

However, a shared sensing infrastructure\nthat leverages low-cost sensing devices for a cost effective solution, still\nremains an unexplored territory. A significant research effort is still needed\nto make edge based data shaping solutions, more reliable, feature-rich and\ncosteffective while addressing the associated challenges in sharing the sensing\ninfrastructure among multiple collocated services with diverse Quality of\nService (QoS) requirements. Towards this, we propose a novel edge based data\npre-processing solution, named UniPreCIS that accounts for the inherent\ncharacteristics of lowcost ambient sensors and the exhibited measurement\ndynamics with respect to application-specific QoS. UniPreCIS aims to identify\nand select quality data sources by performing sensor ranking and selection\nfollowed by multimodal data pre-processing in order to meet heterogeneous\napplication QoS and at the same time reducing the resource consumption\nfootprint for the resource constrained network edge. As observed, the\nprocessing time and memory utilization has been reduced in the proposed\napproach while achieving upto 90% accuracy which is arguably significant as\ncompared to state-of-the-art techniques for sensing.

The findings of the case study include five major\nthemes: i) The process of opening up towards the tool communities correlates in\ntime with a general adoption of OSS in the organization. ii) Assets not seen as\ncompetitive advantage nor a source of revenue are made open to OSS communities,\nand gradually, the organization turns more open. iii) The requirements\nengineering process towards the community is informal and based on engagement.\niv) The need for systematic and automated testing is still in its infancy, but\nthe needs are identified. v) The innovation outcomes included free features and\nmaintenance, and were believed to increase speed and quality in development.\nAdopting OI was a result of a paradigm shift of moving from Windows to Linux.",

    "abstract": "The use of Digital Twins is set to transform the manufacturing sector by\naiding monitoring and real-time decision making. For several applications in\nthis sector, the system to be modeled consists of a mix of discrete-event and\ncontinuous processes interacting with each other. Building simulation-based\nDigital Twins of such systems necessitates an open, flexible simulation\nframework which can support easy modeling and fast simulation of both\ncontinuous and discrete-event components, and their interactions. In this\npaper, we present an outline and key design aspects of a Python-based framework\nfor performing mixed discrete-continuous simulations. The continuous processes\nin the system are assumed to be loosely coupled to other components via\npre-defined events. For example, a continuous state variable crossing a\nthreshold may trigger an external event. Similarly, external events may lead to\na sudden change in the trajectory, state value or boundary conditions in a\ncontinuous process. We first present a systematic events-based interface using\nwhich such interactions can be modeled and simulated. We then discuss\nimplementation details of the framework along with a detailed example. In our\nimplementation, the advancement of time is controlled and performed using the\nevent-stepped engine of SimPy (a popular discrete-event simulation library in\nPython). The continuous processes are modelled using existing frameworks with a\nPython wrapper providing the events interface. We discuss possible improvements\nto the time advancement scheme, a roadmap and use cases for the framework.",

However, the function of this mechanism in machine\nlearning has not been defined clearly. In this study, we propose to lay out a\nframework constituted by a bottom-up and a top-down network. Here, we use a\nTop-down Credit Assignment Network (TDCA-network) to replace the loss function\nand back propagation (BP) which serve as the feedback mechanism in traditional\nbottom-up network training paradigm. Our results show that the credit given by\nwell-trained TDCA-network outperforms the gradient from backpropagation in\nclassification task under different settings on multiple datasets. In addition,\nwe successfully use a credit diffusing trick, which can keep training and\ntesting performance remain unchanged, to reduce parameter complexity of the\nTDCA-network. More importantly, by comparing their trajectories in the\nparameter landscape, we find that TDCA-network directly achieved a global\noptimum, in contrast to that backpropagation only can gain a localized optimum.\nThus, our results demonstrate that TDCA-network not only provide a biological\nplausible learning mechanism, but also has the potential to directly achieve\nglobal optimum, indicating that top-down credit assignment can substitute\nbackpropagation, and provide a better learning framework for Deep Neural\nNetworks.",

Still, grid\nrepresentations such as signed distance functions have attractive properties\nalso in 3D. In particular, they offer constant-time random access and are\neminently suitable for modern machine learning. Unfortunately, the storage size\nof a grid grows exponentially with its dimension. Hence they often exceed\nmemory limits even at moderate resolution. This work explores various low-rank\ntensor formats, including the Tucker, tensor train, and quantics tensor train\ndecompositions, to compress time-varying 3D data. Our method iteratively\ncomputes, voxelizes, and compresses each frame's truncated signed distance\nfunction and applies tensor rank truncation to condense all frames into a\nsingle, compressed tensor that represents the entire 4D scene. We show that\nlow-rank tensor compression is extremely compact to store and query\ntime-varying signed distance functions.

They use linear algebra\non specific Macaulay matrices, considering only multiples of the initial\nequations by one block of variables, the so called ''kernel'' variables. Later,\nBardet et al.

    "abstract": "The fast integration of 5G communication, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and\nInternet-of-Things (IoT) technologies is envisioned to enable Next Generation\nNetworks (NGNs) for diverse smart services and user-defined applications for\nSmart Cities. However, it is still challenging to build a scalable and\nefficient infrastructure that satisfies the various performance, security, and\nmanagement demands by heterogeneous IoT applications across multiple\nadministrative domains. This paper presents a dynamic edge resource federation\narchitecture, which integrates the concept of network slicing (NS) and\nblockchain to improve scalability, dynamicity, and security for multi-domain\nIoT applications. A NS-enabled dynamic edge resource federation framework\nadopts intelligent mechanisms to support efficient multi-domain service\ncoordination that satisfies diverse Quality of Service (QoS) and security\nrequirements. We propose a Hierarchical Integrated Federated Ledger (HIFL),\nwhich aims to guarantee decentralized security and privacy-preserving\nproperties in multi-domain resource orchestration and service re-adjustment. As\na secure-by-design solution, HIFL is promising to support efficient, trust and\nsecured end-to-end IoT services. A preliminary proof-of-concept prototype has\nbeen implemented for comparing intra- and inter-domain performance\nexpectations.",

This task has been extensively researched in the last decade, and\nthe performance of NLI systems has steadily improved over the years.

We use this perspective in order to tackle\nboth NLI and a (much less researched) companion task, i.e., guessing whether a\ntext has been written by a native or a non-native speaker. Using three datasets\nof different provenance (two datasets of English learners' essays and a dataset\nof social media posts), we investigate which kind of linguistic traits\n(lexical, morphological, syntactic, and statistical) are most effective for\nsolving our two tasks, namely, are most indicative of a speaker's L1.

Nevertheless, the development of\nblockchain applications is still a challenge.

To\nsupport the approach, a web platform to configure and generate a blockchain\napplication for on-chain traceability is introduced. First, a feature model has\nbeen designed to model core features of the chosen domain, based on the\nexisting literature. Then, a configurator has been implemented to support the\nfeature selection phase. Finally, a generator is able to ingest such\nconfigurations to generate on-the-shelf blockchain products.

    "abstract": "Kinematic structures are very common in the real world. They range from\nsimple articulated objects to complex mechanical systems. However, despite\ntheir relevance, most model-based 3D tracking methods only consider rigid\nobjects. To overcome this limitation, we propose a flexible framework that\nallows the extension of existing 6DoF algorithms to kinematic structures. Our\napproach focuses on methods that employ Newton-like optimization techniques,\nwhich are widely used in object tracking. The framework considers both\ntree-like and closed kinematic structures and allows a flexible configuration\nof joints and constraints. To project equations from individual rigid bodies to\na multi-body system, Jacobians are used. For closed kinematic chains, a novel\nformulation that features Lagrange multipliers is developed. In a detailed\nmathematical proof, we show that our constraint formulation leads to an exact\nkinematic solution and converges in a single iteration. Based on the proposed\nframework, we extend ICG, which is a state-of-the-art rigid object tracking\nalgorithm, to multi-body tracking.

The quality assurance of these libraries is critical to the\ndependable deployment of DL applications. A few techniques have thereby been\nproposed to test DL libraries by generating DL models as test inputs. Then\nthese techniques feed those DL models to DL libraries for making inferences, in\norder to exercise DL libraries modules related to a DL model's execution.\nHowever, the test effectiveness of these techniques is constrained by the\ndiversity of generated DL models. Our investigation finds that these techniques\ncan cover at most 11.7% of layer pairs (i.e., call sequence between two layer\nAPIs) and 55.8% of layer parameters (e.g., \"padding\" in Conv2D). As a result,\nwe find that many bugs arising from specific layer pairs and parameters can be\nmissed by existing techniques.\nIn view of the limitations of existing DL library testing techniques, we\npropose MEMO to efficiently generate diverse DL models by exploring layer\ntypes, layer pairs, and layer parameters. MEMO: (1) designs an initial model\nreduction technique to boost test efficiency without compromising model\ndiversity; and (2) designs a set of mutation operators for a customized Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to explore new layer types, layer pairs, and\nlayer parameters.

For\nthis means, we monitored the removal of vaccine related content on the platform\nand also applied various techniques to analyze the differences in discourse and\nengagement in pro and anti-vaccine \"comment sections\". We found that American\nanti-vaccine content tend to lead to considerably more toxic and negative\ndiscussion than their pro-vaccine counterparts while also leading to 18% higher\nuser-user engagement, while Brazilian anti-vaccine content was significantly\nless engaging. We also found that pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine discourses are\nconsiderably different as the former is associated with conspiracy theories\n(e.g. ccp), misinformation and alternative medicine (e.g. hydroxychloroquine),\nwhile the latter is associated with protective measures. Finally, it was\nobserved that YouTube content removals are still insufficient, with only\napproximately 16% of the anti-vaccine content being removed by the end of the\nstudied period, with the USA registering the highest percentage of removed\nanti-vaccine content(34%) and BR registering the lowest(9.8%).",

Method: We design the experiments as a differentiated replication\nof past experiments with STRIDE. The replication design is aimed at capturing\nsome similar measures (e.g., of outcome quality) and additional measures (e.g.,\ndiversity dimensions). We plan to conduct the experiments in an academic\nsetting. Limitations: Obtaining a balanced population (e.g., wrt gender) in\nadvanced computer science courses is not realistic. The experiments we plan to\nconduct with MSc level students will certainly suffer this limitation.",

Here, a local Fourier analysis (LFA) convergence theory is derived for\nthe two-level variant of the iterative parallel-in-time method of multigrid\nreduction-in-time (MGRIT). This closed-form theory allows for new insights into\nthe poor convergence of MGRIT for advection-dominated PDEs when using the\nstandard approach of rediscretizing the fine-grid problem on the coarse grid.\nSpecifically, we show that this poor convergence arises, at least in part, from\ninadequate coarse-grid correction of certain smooth Fourier modes known as\ncharacteristic components, which was previously identified as causing poor\nconvergence of classical spatial multigrid on steady-state advection-dominated\nPDEs. We apply this convergence theory to show that, for certain\nsemi-Lagrangian discretizations of advection problems, MGRIT convergence using\nrediscretized coarse-grid operators cannot be robust with respect to CFL number\nor coarsening factor. A consequence of this analysis is that techniques\ndeveloped for improving convergence in the spatial multigrid context can be\nre-purposed in the MGRIT context to develop more robust parallel-in-time\nsolvers.

    "abstract": "Recently, it has been observed that a transfer learning solution might be all\nwe need to solve many few-shot learning benchmarks -- thus raising important\nquestions about when and how meta-learning algorithms should be deployed. In\nthis paper, we seek to clarify these questions by 1. proposing a novel metric\n-- the diversity coefficient -- to measure the diversity of tasks in a few-shot\nlearning benchmark and 2. by comparing Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and\ntransfer learning under fair conditions (same architecture, same optimizer, and\nall models trained to convergence). Using the diversity coefficient, we show\nthat the popular MiniImageNet and CIFAR-FS few-shot learning benchmarks have\nlow diversity. This novel insight contextualizes claims that transfer learning\nsolutions are better than meta-learned solutions in the regime of low diversity\nunder a fair comparison. Specifically, we empirically find that a low diversity\ncoefficient correlates with a high similarity between transfer learning and\nMAML learned solutions in terms of accuracy at meta-test time and\nclassification layer similarity (using feature based distance metrics like\nSVCCA, PWCCA, CKA, and OPD). To further support our claim, we find this\nmeta-test accuracy holds even as the model size changes. Therefore, we conclude\nthat in the low diversity regime, MAML and transfer learning have equivalent\nmeta-test performance when both are compared fairly. We also hope our work\ninspires more thoughtful constructions and quantitative evaluations of\nmeta-learning benchmarks in the future.",

From an\ninformation-theoretic perspective, scaling the design of tightly-coupled\nmassive MIMO systems in terms of the number of antennas, the operational\nbandwidth, and form factor was not addressed in prior art and hence not clearly\nunderstood. We investigate this open research problem using a physically\nconsistent modeling approach for far-field (FF) MIMO communication based on\nmulti-port circuit theory. In doing so, we turn mutual coupling (MC) from a foe\nto a friend of MIMO systems design, thereby challenging a basic percept in\nantenna systems engineering that promotes MC mitigation/compensation. We show\nthat tight MC widens the operational bandwidth of antenna arrays thereby\nunleashing a missing MIMO gain that we coin \"bandwidth gain\".

Unfortunately, existing OSFS\nalgorithms never consider such uncertain relationship. To fill this gap, we in\nthis paper propose an online sparse streaming feature selection with\nuncertainty (OS2FSU) algorithm. OS2FSU consists of two main parts: 1) latent\nfactor analysis is utilized to pre-estimate the missing data in sparse\nstreaming features before con-ducting feature selection, and 2) fuzzy logic and\nneighborhood rough set are employed to alleviate the uncertainty between\nestimated streaming features and labels during conducting feature selection.

This is arguably even more of a problem for this\nkind of tasks than elsewhere in machine learning, because the dynamical systems\ntypically described by PDEs often exhibit subtle, multiscale structure that\nmakes errors hard to spot by humans. In this work, we first provide a\nmathematically detailed Bayesian formulation of the ''shallow'' (linear)\nversion of neural operators in the formalism of Gaussian processes. We then\nextend this analytic treatment to general deep neural operators using\napproximate methods from Bayesian deep learning. We extend previous results on\nneural operators by providing them with uncertainty quantification.

This type of network\nunits results in sparse representations from each model layer, as the units are\norganized into blocks where only one unit generates a non-zero output. The main\noperating principle of the introduced units rely on stochastic principles, as\nthe network performs posterior sampling over competing units to select the\nwinner.

Existing advanced models try to enhance\ncartoonization effect by learning to promote edges adversarially, introducing\nstyle transfer loss, or learning to align style from multiple representation\nspace. This paper demonstrates that more distinct and vivid cartoonization\neffect could be easily achieved with only basic adversarial loss. Observing\nthat cartoon style is more evident in cartoon-texture-salient local image\nregions, we build a region-level adversarial learning branch in parallel with\nthe normal image-level one, which constrains adversarial learning on\ncartoon-texture-salient local patches for better perceiving and transferring\ncartoon texture features. To this end, a novel cartoon-texture-saliency-sampler\n(CTSS) module is proposed to dynamically sample cartoon-texture-salient patches\nfrom training data. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that texture\nsaliency adaptive attention in adversarial learning, as a missing ingredient of\nrelated methods in image cartoonization, is of significant importance in\nfacilitating and enhancing image cartoon stylization, especially for\nhigh-resolution input pictures.",

    "abstract": "Robot skills systems are meant to reduce robot setup time for new\nmanufacturing tasks. Yet, for dexterous, contact-rich tasks, it is often\ndifficult to find the right skill parameters. One strategy is to learn these\nparameters by allowing the robot system to learn directly on the task. For a\nlearning problem, a robot operator can typically specify the type and range of\nvalues of the parameters. Nevertheless, given their prior experience, robot\noperators should be able to help the learning process further by providing\neducated guesses about where in the parameter space potential optimal solutions\ncould be found. Interestingly, such prior knowledge is not exploited in current\nrobot learning frameworks. We introduce an approach that combines user priors\nand Bayesian optimization to allow fast optimization of robot industrial tasks\nat robot deployment time. We evaluate our method on three tasks that are\nlearned in simulation as well as on two tasks that are learned directly on a\nreal robot system. Additionally, we transfer knowledge from the corresponding\nsimulation tasks by automatically constructing priors from well-performing\nconfigurations for learning on the real system. To handle potentially\ncontradicting task objectives, the tasks are modeled as multi-objective\nproblems. Our results show that operator priors, both user-specified and\ntransferred, vastly accelerate the discovery of rich Pareto fronts, and\ntypically produce final performance far superior to proposed baselines.",

ML-based\naggregation of EHR data is mostly tool-driven, i.e., building on available or\nnewly developed methods. However, these methods, their input requirements, and,\nimportantly, resulting output are frequently difficult to interpret, especially\nwithout in-depth data science or statistical training. This endangers the final\nstep of analysis where an actionable and clinically meaningful interpretation\nis needed.This study investigates approaches to perform patient stratification\nanalysis at scale using large EHR datasets and multiple clustering methods for\nclinical research. We have developed several tools to facilitate the clinical\nevaluation and interpretation of unsupervised patient stratification results,\nnamely pattern screening, meta clustering, surrogate modeling, and curation.\nThese tools can be used at different stages within the analysis. As compared to\na standard analysis approach, we demonstrate the ability to condense results\nand optimize analysis time. In the case of meta clustering, we demonstrate that\nthe number of patient clusters can be reduced from 72 to 3 in one example. In\nanother stratification result, by using surrogate models, we could quickly\nidentify that heart failure patients were stratified if blood sodium\nmeasurements were available. As this is a routine measurement performed for all\npatients with heart failure, this indicated a data bias. By using further\ncohort and feature curation, these patients and other irrelevant features could\nbe removed to increase the clinical meaningfulness. These examples show the\neffectiveness of the proposed methods and we hope to encourage further research\nin this field.",

Such text-based synthesis methods are\nparticularly appealing to humans who are used to verbally describe their\nintent. Therefore, it is only natural to extend the text-driven image synthesis\nto text-driven image editing. Editing is challenging for these generative\nmodels, since an innate property of an editing technique is to preserve most of\nthe original image, while in the text-based models, even a small modification\nof the text prompt often leads to a completely different outcome.\nState-of-the-art methods mitigate this by requiring the users to provide a\nspatial mask to localize the edit, hence, ignoring the original structure and\ncontent within the masked region. In this paper, we pursue an intuitive\nprompt-to-prompt editing framework, where the edits are controlled by text\nonly. To this end, we analyze a text-conditioned model in depth and observe\nthat the cross-attention layers are the key to controlling the relation between\nthe spatial layout of the image to each word in the prompt. With this\nobservation, we present several applications which monitor the image synthesis\nby editing the textual prompt only. This includes localized editing by\nreplacing a word, global editing by adding a specification, and even delicately\ncontrolling the extent to which a word is reflected in the image.

    "abstract": "Stress during public speaking is common and adversely affects performance and\nself-confidence. Extensive research has been carried out to develop various\nmodels to recognize emotional states. However, minimal research has been\nconducted to detect stress during public speaking in real time using voice\nanalysis. In this context, the current review showed that the application of\nalgorithms was not properly explored and helped identify the main obstacles in\ncreating a suitable testing environment while accounting for current\ncomplexities and limitations. In this paper, we present our main idea and\npropose a stress detection computational algorithmic model that could be\nintegrated into a Virtual Reality (VR) application to create an intelligent\nvirtual audience for improving public speaking skills. The developed model,\nwhen integrated with VR, will be able to detect excessive stress in real time\nby analysing voice features correlated to physiological parameters indicative\nof stress and help users gradually control excessive stress and improve public\nspeaking performance",

To test\na model, a specific cleaned data set is assembled. However, when deployed in\nthe real world, the model will face unexpected, out-of-distribution (OOD) data.\nIn this work, we show that the so-called \"radiologist-level\" CheXnet model\nfails to recognize all OOD images and classifies them as having lung disease.\nTo address this issue, we propose in-distribution voting, a novel method to\nclassify out-of-distribution images for multi-label classification. Using\nindependent class-wise in-distribution (ID) predictors trained on ID and OOD\ndata we achieve, on average, 99 % ID classification specificity and 98 %\nsensitivity, improving the end-to-end performance significantly compared to\nprevious works on the chest X-ray 14 data set.

The phase separation can be\ndirected through the use of chemically patterned substrates to promote the\nformation of morphologies that are essential to the production of semiconductor\ndevices. Moreover, the design of substrate pattern can formulated as an\noptimization problem for which we seek optimal substrate designs that\neffectively produce given target morphologies.\nIn this paper, we adopt a phase field model given by a nonlocal\nCahn--Hilliard partial differential equation (PDE) based on the minimization of\nthe Ohta--Kawasaki free energy, and present an efficient PDE-constrained\noptimization framework for the optimal design problem. The design variables are\nthe locations of circular- or strip-shaped guiding posts that are used to model\nthe substrate chemical pattern.

In contrast, routine\ninter-employee communication patterns within workplaces tend to emerge more\nnaturally, as a consequence of both supervisory relationships and the needs of\nthe organization. Scholars of organizational management have proposed theories\nrelating organizational trees to communication dynamics and measures of\nbusiness performance. Separately, network scientists have studied the\ntopological structure of communication patterns in different types of\norganizations. However, the nature of the relationship between a formal\norganizational structure and emergent communications between employees remains\nunclear. In this paper, we study associations between organizational hierarchy\nand communication dynamics among approximately 200,000 employees of a large\nsoftware company in May 2019. We propose new measures of communication\nreciprocity and new shortest-path distances for trees to characterize the\nfrequency of messages passed up, down, and across the organizational hierarchy.\nBy dividing the organization into 88 teams -- organizational trees rooted at\nthe senior leadership level -- we identify distinct communication network\nstructures within and between teams.

In the workflow of VQA, the parameters of ansatz are iteratively\nupdated to approximate the desired quantum states. We have seen various efforts\nto draft better ansatz with less gates. In quantum computers, the gate ansatz\nwill eventually be transformed into control signals such as microwave pulses on\ntransmons. And the control pulses need elaborate calibration to minimize the\nerrors such as over-rotation and under-rotation. In the case of VQAs, this\nprocedure will introduce redundancy, but the variational properties of VQAs can\nnaturally handle problems of over-rotation and under-rotation by updating the\namplitude and frequency parameters. Therefore, we propose PAN, a native-pulse\nansatz generator framework for VQAs. We generate native-pulse ansatz with\ntrainable parameters for amplitudes and frequencies. In our proposed PAN, we\nare tuning parametric pulses, which are natively supported on NISQ computers.\nConsidering that parameter-shift rules do not hold for native-pulse ansatz, we\nneed to deploy non-gradient optimizers. To constrain the number of parameters\nsent to the optimizer, we adopt a progressive way to generate our native-pulse\nansatz. Experiments are conducted on both simulators and quantum devices to\nvalidate our methods. When adopted on NISQ machines, PAN obtained improved the\nperformance with decreased latency by an average of 86%.

    "abstract": "There has been an increased interest in applying deep neural networks to\nautomatically interpret and analyze the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). The\ncurrent paradigms with machine learning methods are often limited by the amount\nof labeled data. This phenomenon is particularly problematic for\nclinically-relevant data, where labeling at scale can be time-consuming and\ncostly in terms of the specialized expertise and human effort required.\nMoreover, deep learning classifiers may be vulnerable to adversarial examples\nand perturbations, which could have catastrophic consequences, for example,\nwhen applied in the context of medical treatment, clinical trials, or insurance\nclaims.

We obtain augmented samples by perturbing the\ndata distribution towards other classes along the geodesic in Wasserstein\nspace. To better utilize domain-specific knowledge, we design a ground metric\nthat recognizes the difference between ECG signals based on physiologically\ndetermined features.

The Floquet analysis of the underlying system reveals that under\nmodulation, the instability sets in as a convective roll pattern executing\nharmonic or subharmonic oscillations, depending upon the modulation, the angle\nof inclination, and Prandtl number of the fluid. Under modulation, the value of\nthe angle of inclination for the codimension-2 point is found to be a\nnonconstant function of the amplitude and the frequency of modulation.

    "abstract": "An ideal synthetic population, a key input to activity-based models, mimics\nthe distribution of the individual- and household-level attributes in the\nactual population. Since the entire population's attributes are generally\nunavailable, household travel survey (HTS) samples are used for population\nsynthesis. Synthesizing population by directly sampling from HTS ignores the\nattribute combinations that are unobserved in the HTS samples but exist in the\npopulation, called 'sampling zeros'. A deep generative model (DGM) can\npotentially synthesize the sampling zeros but at the expense of generating\n'structural zeros' (i.e., the infeasible attribute combinations that do not\nexist in the population). This study proposes a novel method to minimize\nstructural zeros while preserving sampling zeros. Two regularizations are\ndevised to customize the training of the DGM and applied to a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) and a variational autoencoder (VAE). The adopted\nmetrics for feasibility and diversity of the synthetic population indicate the\ncapability of generating sampling and structural zeros -- lower structural\nzeros and lower sampling zeros indicate the higher feasibility and the lower\ndiversity, respectively. Results show that the proposed regularizations achieve\nconsiderable performance improvement in feasibility and diversity of the\nsynthesized population over traditional models. The proposed VAE additionally\ngenerated 23.5% of the population ignored by the sample with 79.2% precision\n(i.e., 20.8% structural zeros rates), while the proposed GAN generated 18.3% of\nthe ignored population with 89.0% precision.

Previous work in\nthis area focused on the derivation of identifiability conditions. We propose\ninstead a first algorithm to address both identifiable and unidentifiable\nqueries. We prove that, in spite of the missingness induced by the selection\nbias, the likelihood of the available data is unimodal. This enables us to use\nthe causal expectation-maximisation scheme to obtain the values of causal\nqueries in the identifiable case, and to compute bounds otherwise.

Unsupervised machine learning\nmethods have the ability to compresses, characterize and visualises unlabelled\ndata. In this paper, we present a framework that utilizes unsupervised machine\nlearning methods that includes combination of selected dimensional reduction\nand clustering methods to discriminate and visualise the associations with the\nmajor COVID-19 variants based on genome sequences. The framework utilises k-mer\nanalysis for processing the genome (RNA) sequences and compares different\ndimensional reduction methods, that include principal component analysis (PCA),\nand t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE), and uniform manifold\napproximation projection (UMAP). Furthermore, the framework employs\nagglomerative hierarchical clustering methods and provides a visualisation\nusing a dendogram.

In order to fill this gap, we\nanalyse detrended correlations of the price returns, the average number of\ntrades in time unit, and the traded volume based on high-frequency data\nrepresenting two major cryptocurrencies: bitcoin and ether. We apply the\nmultifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis, which is considered the most\nreliable method for identifying nonlinear correlations in time series. We find\nthat all the quantities considered in our study show an unambiguous\nmultifractal structure from both the univariate (auto-correlation) and\nbivariate (cross-correlation) perspectives. We looked at the bitcoin--ether\ncross-correlations in simultaneously recorded signals, as well as in\ntime-lagged signals, in which a time series for one of the cryptocurrencies is\nshifted with respect to the other. Such a shift suppresses the\ncross-correlations partially for short time scales, but does not remove them\ncompletely. We did not observe any qualitative asymmetry in the results for the\ntwo choices of a leading asset.

    "abstract": "The automatic segmentation of blood vessels in fundus images can help analyze\nthe condition of retinal vasculature, which is crucial for identifying various\nsystemic diseases like hypertension, diabetes, etc. Despite the success of Deep\nLearning-based models in this segmentation task, most of them are heavily\nparametrized and thus have limited use in practical applications. This paper\nproposes IterMiUnet, a new lightweight convolution-based segmentation model\nthat requires significantly fewer parameters and yet delivers performance\nsimilar to existing models. The model makes use of the excellent segmentation\ncapabilities of Iternet architecture but overcomes its heavily parametrized\nnature by incorporating the encoder-decoder structure of MiUnet model within\nit. Thus, the new model reduces parameters without any compromise with the\nnetwork's depth, which is necessary to learn abstract hierarchical concepts in\ndeep models. This lightweight segmentation model speeds up training and\ninference time and is potentially helpful in the medical domain where data is\nscarce and, therefore, heavily parametrized models tend to overfit. The\nproposed model was evaluated on three publicly available datasets: DRIVE,\nSTARE, and CHASE-DB1. Further cross-training and inter-rater variability\nevaluations have also been performed. The proposed model has a lot of potential\nto be utilized as a tool for the early diagnosis of many diseases.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we evaluate how neural networks with periodic activation\nfunctions can be leveraged to reliably compress large multidimensional medical\nimage datasets, with proof-of-concept application to 4D diffusion-weighted MRI\n(dMRI). In the medical imaging landscape, multidimensional MRI is a key area of\nresearch for developing biomarkers that are both sensitive and specific to the\nunderlying tissue microstructure. However, the high-dimensional nature of these\ndata poses a challenge in terms of both storage and sharing capabilities and\nassociated costs, requiring appropriate algorithms able to represent the\ninformation in a low-dimensional space. Recent theoretical developments in deep\nlearning have shown how periodic activation functions are a powerful tool for\nimplicit neural representation of images and can be used for compression of 2D\nimages. Here we extend this approach to 4D images and show how any given 4D\ndMRI dataset can be accurately represented through the parameters of a\nsinusoidal activation network, achieving a data compression rate about 10 times\nhigher than the standard DEFLATE algorithm. Our results show that the proposed\napproach outperforms benchmark ReLU and Tanh activation perceptron\narchitectures in terms of mean squared error, peak signal-to-noise ratio and\nstructural similarity index. Subsequent analyses using the tensor and spherical\nharmonics representations demonstrate that the proposed lossy compression\nreproduces accurately the characteristics of the original data, leading to\nrelative errors about 5 to 10 times lower than the benchmark JPEG2000 lossy\ncompression and similar to standard pre-processing steps such as MP-PCA\ndenosing, suggesting a loss of information within the currently accepted levels\nfor clinical application.",
